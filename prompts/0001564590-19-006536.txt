Item 1. Business
Overview
 Adverum is a clinical-stage gene therapy company targeting unmet medical need in ocular and rare diseases. We develop gene therapy product candidates designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein. Our core capabilities include clinical development, novel vector discovery, and in-house manufacturing expertise, specifically in scalable process development, assay development, and current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) quality control. 
 We are advancing a pipeline of novel gene therapy product candidates designed to treat ocular and rare diseases. Our pipeline of internal programs and partnered programs is shown below. 
 


We are conducting a clinical trial for our most advanced gene therapy candidate ADVM‑022, AAV.7m8-aflibercept, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). ADVM‑022 uses a proprietary capsid (“AAV.7m8”) to deliver a proprietary expression cassette which expresses aflibercept.  ADVM‑022 is administered as a single intravitreal injection and is designed to minimize the treatment burden of repeated anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (“VEGF”) injections, which is the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. In November 2018, we dosed the first patient in the ADVM‑022 Phase 1 clinical trial entitled “An Open Label Phase 1 Study of ADVM‑022 (AAV.7m8-aflibercept) in Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (“OPTIC trial”). We expect to provide an update on enrollment from the OPTIC trial in the first half of 2019.  In addition, we expect to provide interim data from the OPTIC trial by the first quarter of 2020.
 We collaborate with other industry leaders in order to leverage our expertise to develop gene therapy candidates.  We have entered into collaboration agreements with Editas Medicine, Inc. (“Editas”) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”).  In addition, we have licensed the right to use AAV.7m8 to GenSight Biologics S.A. (“GenSight”).

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to discover, develop, and commercialize novel gene therapies with the potential to treat patients living with ocular and rare diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Target large patient population impacted by wet AMD. There are an estimated 1.2 million individuals in the U.S. and 3 million worldwide living with wet AMD, and the incidence of new cases is expected to continue to grow significantly as the population ages. We estimate that the standard-of-care therapies generated in excess of $10 billion worldwide in sales in 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Address unmet medical need by supplanting chronic treatment regimens with a one-time gene therapy treatment. Our gene therapies are designed as single-administration treatments to address the unmet needs of patients with ocular and rare diseases. The current standard of care for wet AMD and many rare diseases require frequent injections for the duration of the disease, which represent significant treatment burden for patients and their care-takers. As an example, for wet AMD, the current standard-of-care treatments require patients to receive intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF protein every 4-12 weeks, which can be difficult for patients to comply with, leading to loss of vision from underdosing. A single-dose gene therapy has the potential to alleviate this treatment burden.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue indications with well-defined clinical and regulatory paths where possible, to mitigate the risk of the development of our novel gene therapies. We have selected indications that have prior clinical validation, including established endpoints, and defined regulatory paths. For example, for wet AMD, aflibercept is an approved standard-of-care treatment, and ADVM‑022 utilizes a proprietary vector designed to provide the same anti-VEGF protein through a single intravitreal injection. We are evaluating whether other ocular diseases with approved anti-VEGF therapies might also be treated with ADVM‑022. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our earlier-stage research initiatives and leverage our industry-leading capabilities in novel vector development. We leverage our next-generation AAV-based directed evolution platform to engineer AAV capsids with enhanced tropism for certain tissues and/or improved antibody neutralization profiles over existing AAV variants. Combining our vectorology and manufacturing expertise, we have the capability to generate high-quantity recombinant AAV capsid libraries that can be screened in large animals rather than rodents, to maximize applicability of the screens to human subjects. We are also focused on discovering improved ubiquitous and cell-specific promoters and expression cassettes to offer optimal transgene expression target tissues. We plan to use this expertise to expand our pipeline and manage the life cycle of our novel gene therapies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaborate with partners to leverage our industry-leading AAV vector expertise and ocular vector development and product delivery capabilities. Under a collaboration agreement with Editas Medicine, we are leveraging our proprietary AAV vectors for use with Editas’ leading CRISPR-based genome editing technologies to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. Our collaboration agreement with Regeneron provides for the development of up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets and, includes AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile XLRS. We plan to continue to explore ways to work collaboratively with these and potential new partners that may benefit from our capabilities and expertise in AAV vector development and product delivery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our process development capabilities to support late-stage clinical trials and commercialization. We are investing in a facility which will allow us to expand our internal process development capabilities. Our manufacturing process is based on the Baculovirus/Sf9 production system, which has been used for a number of vaccines and recombinant protein therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and European Medical Agency (“EMA”), and is capable of producing large quantities of AAVs. Our strategy is to develop scalable processes to transfer to our cGMP contract manufacturers, commensurate with our stage of development. Our new facility will expand our in-house process development capabilities to support larger, late-stage clinical trials and commercialization.

Gene Therapy Background 
 Gene therapy is a powerful treatment modality to address disease biology in a targeted and efficient way. With gene therapy, patients receive vectors encoding therapeutic genes, expressing a therapeutic protein or the functional version of a mutated protein. Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing once, or a very limited number of times, to achieve a long-term, durable benefit. Once a patient’s cells have incorporated the therapeutic gene, the cells potentially are able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years.
 Similar to existing classes of protein or biologic therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and drug-antibody conjugates, gene therapy has taken a number of years to evolve from a research tool into a viable and compelling treatment modality. There have been several recent advances in gene therapy, including the following:

• | Substantial clinical data. Positive data from gene therapy clinical trials have been reported in a variety of indications, including hemophilia, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, X-linked myotubular myopathy, Sanfilippo syndrome, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1a, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as several ocular diseases including biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, choroideremia, and X‑linked retinitis pigmentosa.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant investment by biopharmaceutical companies. The modality of gene therapy has received significant interest and investments by biopharmaceutical companies. Large, global biopharmaceutical companies, such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis, Regeneron, Sanofi, and Shire Pharmaceuticals Group Plc, have increased their investment in the gene therapy field. Additionally, pure-play gene therapy companies, such as Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., REGENXBIO Inc., Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., uniQure N.V., Abeona Therapeutics, Nightstar Therapeutics, Sarepta Therapeutics, Solid Biosciences, and Voyager Therapeutics, have attracted recent investment in this growing field.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval of cell and gene therapy products by regulatory authorities. The FDA and EMA have approved several cell and gene therapy products. In December 2017, the FDA approved its first AAV vector-based gene therapy product, LUXTURNA™ (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Novel AAV Vector Discovery and Optimization System
 Our next-generation discovery platform is based on vectors derived from AAV, which is a small, non-pathogenic virus, which carry a therapeutic DNA instead of the viral genes. The resulting vector is used to deliver a gene into a desired cell population, which when expressed, can provide sustained protein production. We believe AAV vectors offer numerous advantages over other viral and non-viral vector technologies used for gene therapy. These advantages, highlighted below, have the potential to allow AAVs to be safe, to be applicable for a variety of indications, and to exhibit long-term efficacy.

• | Highly-efficient transfer of DNA. AAV vectors offer highly-efficient transfer of DNA to the patient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-pathogenic. Naturally occurring AAV is not known to cause disease in humans.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-replicating. Naturally occurring AAV is incapable of replication without co-infection of a helper virus such as adenovirus, herpes virus, or others. Once inside the host cell, AAV vectors do not replicate, and cannot spread in the absence of co-infection.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term expression. Once incorporated into the host cell, AAV vectors can continue to drive expression of a therapeutic protein for years, making AAV-based gene therapy a compelling treatment modality for diseases requiring frequent chronic treatment regimens.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low-integrating potential. AAV vector genomes remain mainly as a stable non-integrated episome in the host cell nucleus, mitigating safety concerns associated with genomic integration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low inflammatory potential. Compared to other vectors used in direct gene therapy approaches, AAV vectors elicit mild inflammatory reactions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to transduce non-dividing cells. AAV vectors can efficiently transduce non-dividing cells or slow-dividing cells such as retinal cells and hepatocytes, which allow production of the therapeutic protein at the site of the disease (wet AMD) or its natural organ of production (A1AT).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approved. In December 2017, the FDA approved its first AAV vector-based gene therapy product, LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
AAV-derived vectors are a leading vector used in gene therapy. According to the Journal of Gene Medicine, AAV has been used in over 200 clinical trials as of August 2018. As effective as existing AAV vectors are in gene therapy, we believe there are opportunities for improvement. Naturally occurring AAV variants have evolved with particular characteristics, some of which remain and pose limitations to their use in gene therapy.
 To create next-generation vectors, we use a multi-step process known as directed evolution. Our directed evolution technology uses a library of engineered AAV capsid genes, which exhibit different properties and capabilities than naturally occurring AAVs. Once we have created an initial pool of millions of different AAVs, we screen the AAVs in the pool for novel properties, e.g., specific transduction of a particular cell type, or the capability to evade pre-existing neutralizing immune response. Once capsids with desirable properties are identified, those capsids are screened to create a smaller pool of optimized vectors which are further screened until we have identified a select number of engineered AAVs with the characteristics we seek.

 Ocular Diseases
 ADVM‑022 for Treatment of Wet AMD
 Market for Treating Patients with Wet AMD
 Age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”) is a progressive disease affecting the retinal cells in the macula, the region of the eye responsible for central vision. Disease progression results in the death of retinal cells and the gradual loss of vision. 
 Wet AMD is an advanced form of AMD, affecting approximately 10% of patients living with AMD. In patients with wet AMD, blood vessels begin to invade the space between layers of cells in the retina. These new blood vessels are often leaky, which results in fluid and blood in the retina and causes vision loss.
 Wet AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in patients over 60 years of age, with a prevalence of approximately 1.2 million individuals in the U.S. and 3 million worldwide. The incidence of new cases of wet AMD in the U.S. is approximately 150,000 to 200,000 annually, and this number is expected to grow significantly as the country’s population ages.
 Although the underlying molecular causes of wet AMD are not completely known, VEGF is known to play a central role in the growth of new blood vessels in wet AMD.  The current standard-of-care therapies for wet AMD are proteins that bind VEGF and neutralize its activity.  We estimate that these standard-of-care therapies generated in excess of $10 billion in sales worldwide in 2018. 
 The standard-of-care therapies for wet AMD can be burdensome, as patients generally require chronic intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF protein every 4-12 weeks. Compliance with this regimen can be difficult for patients and their caregivers, leading to compliance deficiencies and loss of vision from underdosing.
 Our Approach for Treating Wet AMD
 ADVM‑022 is our clinical-stage gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of wet AMD. ADVM‑022 uses the AAV.7m8 capsid to deliver a proprietary expression cassette expressing aflibercept. ADVM‑022 is administered as a single intravitreal injection and is designed to minimize the treatment burden of frequent injections required for the standard-of-care treatment. The AAV.7m8 capsid was engineered from AAV2 by directed evolution to efficiently transduce retinal cells following intravitreal injection.  The vector carries a vector genome (“vg”) encoding a codon-optimized cDNA of the aflibercept protein, a current standard of care in wet AMD, under the control of a strong, ubiquitous expression cassette.
 A number of AAV-based gene therapy products, including LUXTURNA, are designed for subretinal injection.  However, we believe intravitreal injection of gene therapy offers substantial benefits over subretinal injection, including:
  
• | intravitreal injection is the current standard of care for wet AMD patients, and more widely used than subretinal injections;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | vector delivered by subretinal injection can only access cells near the injection site (the “bleb”), whereas intravitreal injection allows the vector to access a larger portion of the retinal surface area; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subretinal injections require a surgical setting, while intravitreal injections are administered in an outpatient visit.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Advancing the Clinical Development of ADVM‑022 for Wet AMD
 We initiated the ADVM‑022 Phase 1 clinical trial entitled “An Open Label Phase 1 Study of ADVM 022 (AAV.7m8-aflibercept) in Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration – [OPTIC]” (“the OPTIC trial”) with the first patient dosed in November 2018.  
 The OPTIC trial is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation trial, designed to assess the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection of ADVM‑022 in patients with wet AMD who are responsive to anti-VEGF treatment.  The trial is expected to enroll 18 patients and evaluate three doses of ADVM‑022; first dose: 6 × 1011 vg/eye, second dose: 2 × 1012 vg/eye, and third dose: 6 × 1012 vg/eye.  Subjects will be administered a tapering prophylactic corticosteroid regimen.  The primary endpoint of the trial is the safety and tolerability of ADVM‑022 at 24 weeks after a single intravitreal injection.  Secondary endpoints include changes in best-corrected visual acuity (“BCVA”), measurement of central retinal thickness (“CRT”), as well as mean number of rescue anti-VEGF injections and percentage of patients needing rescue anti-VEGF injections.  The OPTIC trial will last approximately two years.  A diagram of the OPTIC trial is shown below.

We expect to provide an update on enrollment from the OPTIC trial in the first half of 2019.  In addition, we expect to provide interim data from the OPTIC trial by the first quarter of 2020.
 In September 2018, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for ADVM‑022 for wet AMD.  The Fast Track designation is given to drugs and biologics that treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical need.  Fast Track designation makes ADVM‑022 for wet AMD eligible for several benefits, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss our development plan, more frequent written communications, and rolling review our Biological License Application (“BLA”). 
 Beyond wet AMD, we are evaluating whether other ocular diseases with approved anti-VEGF therapies might also be treated with ADVM‑022.
 Preclinical Proof of Concept for ADVM‑022
 ADVM‑022 was designed to provide long-term aflibercept expression following intravitreal injection.  To evaluate the potential of ADVM‑022 to treat wet AMD, we assessed its efficacy non-human primates (“NHPs”).  We observed that a single intravitreal administration of ADVM‑022 provided sustained expression of aflibercept for at least two years at levels comparable to those experienced three to four weeks post-injection of aflibercept protein.  Further, in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model in NHPs, the industry standard model for testing new wet AMD therapies, we observed that a single intravitreal injection of ADVM‑022 13 months before lasering provided the same level of protection from clinically relevant lesions as an intravitreal bolus of aflibercept at the time of lesioning, the current standard of care.

Rare Diseases
 Treatment of A1AT Deficiency
 ADVM‑043 is a gene therapy product candidate designed to provide stable, long-term A1AT protein expression for the treatment of A1AT deficiency. Preclinical studies in mice and non-human primates showed that ADVM‑043 provided stable, robust, long-term expression of A1AT protein.
 In December 2017 we began enrolling patients in the ADVANCE Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of ADVM‑043 for A1AT deficiency (“the ADVANCE trial”), a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of ADVM‑043 in patients with A1AT deficiency.  The ADVANCE trial enrolled a total of six subjects, two subjects per dose at three doses of ADVM‑043: 1.0 × 1012 vg/kg (8.0 × 1013 vg), 5.0 × 10 12 vg/kg (4.0 × 1014 vg) and 1.5 × 10 13 vg/kg (1.2 × 1015 vg).  In November 2018, we announced preliminary data from the ADVANCE trial which demonstrate that ADVM‑043 can be safely administered and was well tolerated during a mean follow-up period of 25 weeks post-administration at doses up to 1.5 × 10 13 vg/kg (1.2 × 1015 vg).  We observed at total of 15 adverse events (AEs), all of which were mild (Grade 1) in severity, except for one serious adverse event (SAE), which was considered Grade 3 in severity but found to be unrelated to ADVM‑043.  Of the 15 adverse events, only two were deemed possibly associated with

ADVM‑043: Two AEs of elevated alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) (Grade 1, mild). The ALTs normalized within a few days after an increase in prednisone dose.  However, A1AT protein expression did not reach a clinically meaningful level, nor was a dose response observed between the three cohorts.   
 Based on data from the ADVANCE trial, we discontinued the development of ADVM‑043, and are conducting additional preclinical studies to evaluate potential paths forward for development of a product candidate for the treatment of A1AT deficiency.  
 We plan to provide an update on the A1AT deficiency program in the first half of 2019.
 HAE
 ADVM‑053 is our preclinical gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of HAE. ADVM‑053 is designed to be administered as a single IV injection to prevent HAE attacks. Like ADVM‑043, ADVM‑053 utilizes an AAVrh.10‑based vector, which has been shown to target the liver, which is the natural source of C1EI. In preclinical studies, a single IV administration of ADVM‑053 showed robust C1EI protein expression. In a proof-of-concept study, ADVM‑053 increased C1EI protein expression above anticipated therapeutic levels. An additional study, in a mouse model of the disease, demonstrated that ADVM‑053 decreased vascular permeability.  However, due to the lack of clinical efficacy that we observed in ADVM‑043, also an AAVrh.10‑based product candidate, are conducting additional preclinical studies to evaluate potential paths forward for development of a product candidate for the treatment of HAE.  
 We plan to provide an update on the ADVM‑053 program in the first half of 2019.   
 Other Preclinical Product Candidates 
 In addition to our lead programs, we are currently utilizing our industry-leading development capabilities for our AAV-based directed evolution platform and are conducting observational studies.  We are in the early stages of preclinical development for additional product candidates that we may advance in the future.
Partnered Program Product Candidates 
 Our partnered programs include vectors we are developing under collaboration agreements. Under an agreement with Editas we are leveraging our AAV-vectors for use with Editas’ leading Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (“CRISPR”)-based genome editing technologies to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. Our agreement with Regeneron provides for development of up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets, which includes AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile X-Linked Retinoschisis (“XLRS”).
 We have also licensed to GenSight rights to use AAV.7m8 for GS030 gene therapy encoding channelrhodopsin protein. GenSight has received approval to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial in retinitis pigmentosa in the U.S., France, and U.K., which began in October 2018.
 Manufacturing 
 Our AAV vector manufacturing process is based on the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (“BEVS”), which has been used in a number of FDA- and EMA-approved products. This approach is well suited for the production of large quantities of AAVs, as it takes advantage of the efficiency of viral infection coupled with the high density and scalability of insect cells grown in serum-free suspension cultures. Compared to the mammalian cell-based approaches commonly used in the field, our manufacturing process is designed to produce higher yields of vectors per manufacturing campaign in a cost-effective manner.
 Our BEVS manufacturing process is presented in the figure below, with the eye as an exemplary target organ.
  
1) | The process begins with two DNA constructs, one encoding the therapeutic protein and the other encoding AAV helper components for the AAV capsid and vector replication.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Each DNA construct is inserted into the genome of a baculovirus to create two types of recombinant baculoviruses.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | The two baculoviruses are used to transduce Sf9 insect cells, which in turn produce large amounts of AAV vectors containing the therapeutic gene of interest.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The transduced Sf9 insect cells are then harvested and treated with a buffer solution to lyse the insect cells and release the AAV vectors.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Recovered AAV vectors are then purified to remove unwanted debris.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


6) | Following purification, the vectors are formulated in a physiological solution and placed in vials.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7) | The resulting drug product is ready for use as a therapeutic treatment for the targeted disease (e.g., injection in the eye to treat wet AMD).
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEVS Manufacturing Process
 
Our AAV manufacturing method is industrialized, highly scalable and ready for adaptation for commercial stage. We believe our process provides the following advantages over competing systems:

• | Industrial-scale biologics production. Our BEVS system can produce quantities of product required at commercial stage by incorporating scalable, well-established process steps used throughout the industry for biologic products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety advantages. Our BEVS system does not use mammalian cell cultures or tumorigenic cell lines, and the DNA sequences used to allow AAV vector production are inactive in mammalian cells, which lowers the risk of off-target expression from our products in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High yield and low cost. Because of its scalability, our BEVS system allows the production of large quantities of AAV vectors, up to the 2000-liter scale. Production at this scale lowers the unit cost of goods and may enable us to meet global demand for large markets, such as wet AMD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High purity. Our BEVS system coupled with our proprietary downstream purification process produces a highly pure drug substance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Precedent regulatory framework. Glybera, an AAV-based gene therapy, and several other vaccines and recombinant protein therapies have been approved by the FDA and EMA using a manufacturing process similar to our BEVS technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our products are manufactured using proprietary cell banks and a scalable process developed internally that is transferred to approved Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”). These CMOs produce investigational drugs under cGMP conditions to support our clinical trials. Raw materials of highest quality are purchased from various suppliers and are used throughout the manufacturing process. 
 We have entered into a manufacturing technology license agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. (“Lonza”). The license agreement provides that the parties will conduct activities to evaluate certain BEVS technology and that we may elect to engage Lonza to manufacture our products. We have also granted to Lonza certain licenses to practice the manufacturing technology for products other than those being developed by us, our affiliates or sublicensees.
 We continue to evaluate new raw material suppliers as well as CMOs with available manufacturing slots, in order to provide manufacturing flexibility. As we prepare for larger, late-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we plan to expand our in-house process development capabilities in stages, allowing us to develop larger-scale processes for transfer to our GMP contract manufacturers.
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new proprietary technologies and therapies and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our single administration, intravitreal approach to the treatment of wet AMD, our AAV-based directed evolution platform, and our expertise in the field of gene therapy provide us with 
 10


competitive advantages.  However, we face actual or potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. 
 Our wet AMD gene therapy ADVM‑022 utilizes a proprietary vector and is administered through a single intravitreal injection and will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development, including biologics, small molecules and gene therapy. The key factors that contribute to success of any approved product include safety profile, efficacy, mode of administration and cost of goods. Existing anti-VEGF therapies are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers as the standard-of-care treatment of patients with wet AMD. To date, we are not aware of any treatment that has demonstrated a better benefit to patients than regular anti-VEGF protein delivery.
 We know of a significant number of product candidates in development for wet AMD, and we group them into four main categories:
  
• | biosimilar anti-VEGFs (e.g. FYB201);
--+-------------------------------------


• | combination / add-on therapy for efficacy improvement (e.g. faricimab);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | next generation anti-VEGF with quarterly injection (e.g. brolucizumab and abicipar pegol); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | long acting delivery device / gene therapy to lower treatment frequency (e.g. ranibizumab port delivery system)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are several other companies with marketed products or products in development for the treatment of wet AMD. These companies include Allergan, Bayer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis, and Regeneron.  
 These companies, as well as competitors we may face, either alone or with their partners, for our other product candidates, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments, and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Regeneron 
 In May 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Regeneron for an initial period of three years to research, develop and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ocular diseases. These products are based on our proprietary viral vectors that express transgenes encoding molecules that modulate up to a total of eight specified targets, and encoding certain endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such targets (such products, including AVA-311, collectively the “Products”). In February 2017, Regeneron exercised its option to extend the research term of the collaboration agreement for an additional three years, through May 1, 2020.
 Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we and Regeneron have been conducting a research program to identify potential Products for a specified time period. Regeneron bears all costs of performing research under the Collaboration Agreement. Regeneron has a right to substitute a certain number of such targets and may, subject to a payment to us, expand the collaboration beyond the four initially designated targets to include up to four additional targets, and endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such additional targets, in the research program, provided that Adverum is not currently developing that target.
 Regeneron has an option, exercisable with respect to all Products containing transgenes expressing molecules that modulate one of the specified targets, to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop and commercialize such Products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of human disease or other medical disorders. Regeneron may exercise this option prior to the expiration of the term of the research program, within a certain time period after the acceptance for filing with the FDA of the IND for such Products. Regeneron must pay us an option fee each time it exercises an option.
 Regeneron has the right to submit an IND with the FDA for Products prior to exercising its option. If Regeneron exercises its option for specified Products, Regeneron will be primarily responsible for developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing such Products.
 We have a right to co-fund costs of developing, manufacturing and commercializing Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a target with respect to which Regeneron has exercised its option, subject to certain exceptions. We may exercise this co-funding right up to two times. If we exercise such right, we may elect to bear up to 35% of all development costs incurred for such Products. For any co-funded Products, Regeneron’s payment obligations extend until the Products are no longer sold in the applicable territory. For those Products for which we exercise this option, either party may opt out of sharing development costs for all Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a protein target, in which case the other party may 
 11


continue to develop and commercialize such Products, subject to the payment of a royalty to the other party ranging from low-single digit to low double-digit royalties. While Regeneron will record all revenue from sales of the co-funded Products, Regeneron will share in the net profits and losses of sales of any Products for which we exercised our co-funding right, with each party receiving a share of profits and bearing its share of losses in accordance with the share of development costs borne by each party for such Product, provided that neither party exercises its opt-out right for such Products.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron made an initial payment of $8.0 million dollars for collaboration research costs, a one-time option fee and a one-time license grant fee.
 In addition to the initial payment, Regeneron may make the following payments to us:
  
• | Reimbursement for additional collaboration research costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Up to $80.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward each of the eight therapeutic candidates, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight therapeutic targets subject to the Collaboration Agreement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tiered, low- to mid-single digit royalties on annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For each Product, Regeneron’s payment obligations extend until the last to occur of the following: (i) the discontinuation of development of the Product or (ii) once a Product is approved by the FDA, the later of (x) the duration of patent coverage for the Product or (y) ten years after first commercial sale of the Product in a particular territory.
 The collaboration agreement will expire with respect to each collaboration target upon expiration of all payment obligations by Regeneron. The collaboration agreement may also be terminated (i) by Regeneron at will, either in its entirety or on a target by target basis, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us, (ii) by either party, upon written notice in connection with a material breach remaining uncured 60 days after initial written notice, (iii) by us, if Regeneron challenges the patent rights licensed by us under the collaboration agreement or (iv) by either party, for insolvency of the other party.
 Under our research, collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron, we are required to have a mutually agreed-on research plan with Regeneron in order to invoice Regeneron for services performed. We do not currently have a research plan in place, and, consequently, we are not currently receiving any reimbursements from Regeneron.
 Editas 
 In August 2016, we entered into a collaboration, option, and license agreement with Editas pursuant to which we and Editas collaborate on certain studies using AAV vectors in connection with Editas’ genome editing technology and we grant to Editas an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive rights to use our proprietary vectors in up to five ophthalmic indications. We received a $1.0 million non-refundable upfront payment, with $0.5 million of such payment to be credited against Editas’ obligation to fund research and development costs during the year ended December 31, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, both we and Editas are subject to exclusivity obligations. In January 2018, we and Editas amended and extended the collaboration, option and license agreement. In consideration of extending the agreement, Editas made a one-time payment of $0.5 million to us in February 2018.  In June 2018, we and Editas entered into a subsequent amendment to the agreement to extend the Research Period and First Option Exercise Date (each as defined in the collaboration, option, and license agreement with Editas, as amended).
 Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, Editas had until November 2018 to exercise the option with respect to a designated initial indication, which Editas declined to do.  With respect to the four other indications, Editas may exercise the option until August 2020, provided that the option will expire in August 2019 if Editas has not exercised one option with respect any other indication by such date. Upon Editas’ timely exercise of the option with respect to the first additional indication for which Editas timely exercises its option, Editas will pay us a $1.5 million fee. Upon each subsequent exercise of the option, Editas will pay us a $1.0 million fee per indication. If Editas elects to develop a product using certain of our proprietary vectors, we will be eligible to receive up to $15.5 million in development and commercialization milestone payments for such product, and tiered royalties between the mid-single digits and low teens on net sales of such product, subject to certain adjustments.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will be in effect until the later of the expiration of the option exercise period or the expiration of the royalty term of the last product. At any time after the option is first exercised, Editas may terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety or on an indication-by-indication or country-by-country basis, upon prior written notice to us. We may also terminate the agreement if Editas challenges our patents relating to our proprietary vectors and does not withdraw such challenge within a defined period of time. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement with written notice upon a bankruptcy of the other party or upon an uncured material breach by the other party.
 University of California 
 Gene Therapy for Eye Disease License Agreement:   In May 2010, we entered into a license agreement, which was amended in September 2013, with the Regents of University of California (“Regents”). Under the license agreement, the Regents have granted to us an exclusive, even as to the Regents, license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Regents’ undivided interest in patent rights covering a method of using recombinant gene delivery vectors for treating or preventing diseases of the eye, to develop and 
 12


commercialize products covered by such patent rights in all fields of use in the U.S. The licensed patent rights are jointly owned by the Regents and Chiron Corporation, which was acquired by Novartis AG (“Chiron”), but our license extends only to the Regents’ interest in such patent rights.
 Under the license agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments totaling up to $0.9 million upon reaching certain stages of development of the licensed products for one indication and totaling up to $0.5 million for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications. Through December 31, 2018, none of these goals had been achieved, and no milestones were payable. The license agreement also contains certain royalty payment requirements for net sales of licensed products.
 This license agreement with the Regents continues in effect for the life of the last-to-expire patent, which we expect to occur in 2020. We expect the agreement to terminate prior to any commercialization of any product candidates to which they apply. 
 AAV.7m8 License Agreement:  In June 2013, we entered into an exclusive worldwide sublicensable license agreement with the Regents to certain intellectual property related to improved AAV vectors, including the AAV.7m8 capsid.  Under this license agreement, we are obligated to make certain de minimis license payments, certain milestone payments totaling up to $1.0 million upon reaching certain stages of development of the licensed products for a first indication, and totaling up to $0.5 million for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications.  In addition, we are obligated to pay Regents royalties on sales of licensed products in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds.
 Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will be in effect on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property covering the manufacture, use, or sale of such product in such country.  We may terminate this agreement in whole or in party by giving Regents 30 days’ prior written notice.  Regents may terminate this agreement for breach by us that remains uncured for 60 days, if we become insolvent, if we directly or through a third-party file a claim that a licensed patent right is invalid or unenforceable, or if we fail to meet or extend the date for meeting certain diligence milestones.
 Cornell University
 Cornell MSA
 We were a party to a master service agreement (“MSA”) with Cornell University (“Cornell”) originally established in August 2014 and amended in December 2015. Under the MSA, Cornell provided assistance in regulatory affairs, overall project management, and parameter development. The MSA, as amended, provided for Annapurna to pay Cornell $13.3 million ratably over four years for these services as services were performed.
 In December 2016, we informed Cornell that we decided to terminate the MSA for material breach, effective January 6, 2017. Subsequently, Cornell informed us that it disputes the validity of our termination of the MSA. Although we intend to defend the validity of our termination of the MSA, we recorded $2.0 million of estimated costs associated with the termination of the MSA during the year ended December 31, 2017. This MSA included services relating to gene therapy programs directed to A1AT deficiency, HAE and severe allergy. Our license agreements with Cornell remained in effect despite termination of the MSA. 
 Following termination of the MSA we contracted with a large-scale CMO that complies with cGMP industry standards to produce product quantities for clinical trials and potential commercial supply. 
 Cornell License Agreements
 In December 2015, Annapurna entered into three licensing agreements with Cornell, pursuant to which we have been advancing gene therapy programs ADVM‑043, ADVM‑053, and severe allergy, which originally were initiated at the Department of Genetic Medicine at Weill Cornell. 
 A1AT Deficiency License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain know-how related to A1AT deficiency and rights to an IND application to initiate clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT.
 HAE License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain technology related to HAE and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the HAE program.
 Allergy License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain patents related to allergens and a non-exclusive license to certain other technology related to allergens.  In October 2018, we notified Cornell of our intent to exercise our right to terminate the Allergy License Agreement, effective January 2019.  
 Across these three license agreements, Cornell is entitled to receive aggregate annual maintenance fees ranging from $30,000 to $0.3 million per year, up to $16.0 million in aggregate milestone payments and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds.
 We may terminate any of these license agreements for convenience upon ninety days written notice. Cornell may terminate any of the license agreements for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Cornell may also terminate the 
 13


HAE License Agreement and/or the Allergy License Agreement if we commence any action and file a written claim asserting that any portion of the licensed patent rights is invalid or unenforceable.
 Inserm Transfert
 In July 2014, we entered into an agreement with Inserm Transfert (“Inserm”) whereby we hold an exclusive license to certain patents to develop and commercialize products for the treatment of FA and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the FA program. The agreement was amended in October 2015 to increase the scope of the intellectual property under the licenses. Under this agreement, Inserm is entitled to receive certain de minimis license payments, certain development milestone payments of up to approximately €2.0 million in the aggregate and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments.
 Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will be in effect on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of the expiration of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property which cover the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country in which such product is sold. Upon a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, we will have a fully paid up, perpetual, irrevocable license with respect to such product in such country under the licensed intellectual property following expiration of this agreement with respect to such product in the applicable country. We may terminate this agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Inserm may terminate this license agreement if Annapurna becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy or fails to meet development milestones and such failure is not cured within a specified number of days. Inserm may also terminate the license granted to us in a given country if we (i) before regulatory approval of a product in any country, have ceased conducting any development of products in all countries for 12 consecutive months or (ii) after regulatory approval of a product in a given country, have ceased marketing such product in such country for 12 consecutive months.
 Pursuant to Section 4.7 of the agreement with Inserm, our acquisition of Annapurna triggered a one-time payment to Inserm of €0.3 million.
 GenSight
 On February 2014, we entered into an agreement with GenSight, in which we granted GenSight a non-exclusive license to our proprietary AAV.7m8 vector to develop gene therapy products to deliver certain therapeutic transgenes. Under the agreement, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Also, we are eligible to receive low to mid-single digit royalties on sales of GenSight’s licensed products.
 GenSight is currently developing GS030, a gene therapy encoding channelrhodopsin protein which incorporates the AAV.7m8 capsid. GenSight has received approval to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial with GS030 to treat retinitis pigmentosa in the U.S., France, and the U.K., which began in October 2018. 
 Virovek
 On October 12, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Virovek, Inc. (“Virovek”), in which we received a non-exclusive license to certain Virovek technology and know-how related to methods and materials for manufacturing AAV. Under the agreement, Virovek is entitled to certain license payments and low-single digit royalty payments. This license with Virovek continues in effect until expiration of the last-to-expire patent.  
Intellectual Property 
 Overview
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. Additionally, we may rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; obtain regulatory exclusivity and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or 
 14


any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 We own or license more than 100 patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including more than 40 pending applications filed by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. In addition, we own or license more than 30 issued patents that are currently in force. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and abroad for a variety of technologies, including research tools and methods, AAV-based biological products, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.
 Company-owned Intellectual Property 
 We own three patent families that are directed to AAV-based compositions and methods for treating or preventing eye diseases associated with neovascularization. Patents and applications in the first of these families relate to compositions and methods for the AAV-based delivery of anti-VEGF proteins, for use in treating neovascular diseases of the eye, including wet AMD, in patients who respond to anti-VEGF protein therapy.  Patents in this family have issued in the U.S. and the Asia/Pacific region, and corresponding applications are pending in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents in this family are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions. Applications in the second and third of these families relate to AAV gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD using the AAV.7m8 vector to deliver ranibizumab or aflibercept. Each family has applications pending in the U.S. and corresponding applications pending abroad. Patents that may eventually issue from either of these patent families, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2037, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We also own eight patent families that are directed to various aspects of our proprietary technology platform. One of these families contains issued patents in the US and Asia, and pending applications in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia.  The remaining families contain pending U.S. provisional or PCT applications or national phase applications in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents that may eventually issue from these families, if any, are generally expected to expire between 2036 and 2038, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 Licensed Intellectual Property
 We have obtained both exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to patents directed to both compositions of matter and methods of use and to other intellectual property.
 For example, we have exclusively licensed several families of patents and patent applications that relate to variant rAAV virions having desirable characteristics, such as increased infectivity, as well as novel methods to screen for such variants.
 One patent family directed to improved rAAV virions that we have exclusively licensed in the ocular field includes granted patents in the U.S., as well as elsewhere in North America and Europe, as well as pending patent applications in the U.S. The patents in this family are projected to expire in 2024, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 Another patent family directed to improved rAAV virions that we have exclusively licensed includes granted U.S. patents and a pending U.S. patent application that are expected to expire in 2031, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 A third patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes claims directed to the novel AAV.7m8 vector, which allows delivery of transgenes to the retina via intravitreal injection, and which we utilize in our clinical candidate ADVM‑022. This family includes issued patents in the U.S. Corresponding applications are pending in the U.S. and elsewhere in North America, Asia and the Pacific. Patents that issue from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2032, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We have also nonexclusively licensed rights to a patent family related to the Baculovirus/SF9 production system that includes issued patents in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. These patents are expected to expire in 2027, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patent applications related to gene therapy treatments for HAE, C1-esterase deficiency, which includes pending U.S. and foreign applications. Patents that grant from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2036, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patents and applications related to the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with FA. This family includes a granted US patent and pending applications in the U.S. and elsewhere in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. Patents that grant from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments.
 15


We have exclusively licensed certain know-how related to gene therapy for A1AT deficiency and rights to an IND to perform clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT.
 Trade Secret Protection
 In some circumstances we may rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our technology and product candidates, including aspects for which we do not obtain patent protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential information and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation
 In the U.S., biologic products, including gene therapy products, are primarily regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act, as well as corresponding implementing regulations promulgated by the FDA.  These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, advertising-promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, export and import of biologics products. FDA clearance must be obtained before conducting human clinical testing of our gene therapy products. New biologics, as well as new dosage forms or new uses of previously approved biologics, require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the U.S. 
 Within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies and FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review.  FDA has published a growing body of guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products developed for rare diseases, on patient-focused drug development, preclinical testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, IND applications, and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. Guidance documents provide the FDA’s current thinking about a particular subject, but are not legally binding. 
 The process required by FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of non-clinical laboratory test and animal studies in accordance with current Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission of an IND to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by the independent institutional review board (“IRB”) of each clinical trial site before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by the institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”) of each clinical trial site, which assesses the safety of clinical research and identifies any potential risks to public health or the environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the biologic product for its proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishment of the identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of the biologic product manufactured under cGMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of each manufacturing facility at which the biologic product is produced, prior to commercialization, to assess compliance with cGMP, regulations, and any additional requirements pertaining to the manufacture and distribution of biologic products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of purity and potency, safety and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Successful completion of FDA audit(s) of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Successful completion of the advisory committee review, if FDA convenes an advisory committee;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product; application fees for products designated as orphan drugs by FDA as waived; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compliance with any post-approval requirements or the potential to conduct post-approval studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Before testing any biologic product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as 
 16


animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.
 The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted as part of an IND to FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions relating to the content of the IND during the review period. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the IND goes into effect and the clinical trial begins. The FDA can impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold on an IND, clinical trials may not commence or proceed without FDA authorization, and then only under terms authorized by FDA.
 Clinical trials involve administering of the investigational biological product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, who are generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. An independent IRB and IBC at each institution where the clinical trial will be conducted must also review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that institution, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The IBC will also assess the safety of the research and until it is completed. Clinical testing also must satisfy GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent from all subjects. 
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA as described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial as support for a BLA if (i) the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP as further detailed in the regulation, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, and (ii) if FDA is able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection, if necessary. In addition, when an applicant submits data from a foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND to support a BLA, FDA requires a description of the actions the applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Further, additional requirements apply when a sponsor intends to base marketing approval of a new drug solely on foreign clinical data.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three o sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | In Phase 1, the typically biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored studies that are generally conducted in a larger subject population than Phase 1 trials to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications. For Phase 2 clinical trials in gene therapy, although the subject population may be larger than the Phase 1 trials, the subject population may still remain relatively limited.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the biological product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of subjects, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse subject population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for any serious and unexpected adverse events that occur during the study, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the clinical protocol or Investigator’s Brochure, as well as any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or 
 17


in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects from the product candidate,. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. As this is a relatively new and expanding areas of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the clinical trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to FDA to support marketing approval. The FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, designed to facilitate safety reporting.  The database includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these clinical trials.  
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
 Each sponsor must register its clinical trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, the registry of new, on-going, and completed clinical trials of drugs, biologics, and device products. 
 Biologics License Applications 
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless a waiver applies, and is subject to a sixty-day filing review period to determine if the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), FDA has a performance goal to review applications within 6 months for priority reviews or 10 months for standard reviews. The review timeline begins upon FDA’s acceptance of the original application submission for filing, no later than 60 calendar days from the date FDA receives the application. In some instances, the review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended depending on the information required in order the FDA reviewers to complete their review of the BLA.
 The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA by issuing a complete response letter if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, and may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret the data differently than we interpret data. Moreover, even if a product receives approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited or subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which could restrict the commercial value of the product. 
 Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Even where a withdrawal is not required, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such product or require a recall of product already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or 
 18


facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the biologic is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA may also inspect the site(s) at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their GCP compliance and will not approve the product unless compliance with the IND study requirements and GCP requirements is satisfactory.
 After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Once the FDA approves a BLA for a first indication, the biologic is granted 12 years of data exclusivity, meaning that no biosimilar application can be submitted to the FDA until four years after approval of the biologic, and no biosimilar application can be approved during the full 12-year period. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilars—companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA may be approved earlier than 12 years. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has provided guidance to sponsors developing regenerative medicine therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, with recommendations on the expedited development and review of these therapies, as provided under the FDCA and the 21st Century Cures Act.  
 Fast track designation.  To qualify for fast track designation, a product candidate must be intended to treat a serious condition and address an unmet medical need. Advantages of fast track designation include the possibility for a rolling review, eligibility for priority review, and the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA.  In addition, under the Fast Track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic product based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or conditions that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic product candidate approved using a surrogate endpoint is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials to confirm the beneficial effect on a clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct or to confirm a clinical benefit during these required trials may result in FDA withdrawal of the approved biologic product from the market. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation, priority review designation, and accelerated approval.
 Breakthrough therapy designation.  To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, a product candidate must be intended to treat a serious condition, and have preliminary clinical data indicating that it provides a substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross‑disciplinary review; and rolling review.
 Regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation.  To qualify for the RMAT designation, a product candidate must be a regenerative medicine therapy intended to treat a serious condition, and there must be preliminary clinical evidence that the candidate has the potential to address unmet medical need.  The FDA has indicated that gene therapies may qualify as regenerative medicine therapies.  Advantages of RMAT designation include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints and the addresses potential ways to support accelerated approval and satisfy post-approval requirements.
 Priority review. A product, including those that received fast track, breakthrough therapy, or RMAT designations, may be eligible for priority review, if it meets the criteria for priority review at the time the BLA is submitted. If priority review is granted, FDA has a 6-month goal for reviewing the marketing application or efficacy supplement 
 Accelerated approval.  Drug or biologic products with evidence showing that they provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for serious or life‑threatening illnesses may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of clinical data establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit.  As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor conduct post‑marketing clinical trials. 
 Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”)
 19


Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—-generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States will be recovered from sales of the product.
 ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. ODD does not affect the regulatory review and approval process. However, the first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA ODD is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product in the approved indication. During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Under FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, in proactively promoting a biologic, a company generally can make only those substantiated claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications approved by the FDA and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the biologic. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in fines, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by the sponsor and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. However, if the FDA finds that we have promoted off-label use of any product that is eventually approved, sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty law, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs and protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information of certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that perform services for them involving individually identifiable health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry have received increased public and governmental scrutiny for the cost of drugs. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices and the U.S. Senate is investigating several pharmaceutical companies relating to drug price increases and pricing practices. If we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of gene therapy products l. In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. A number of gene or cell therapy products have been approved over the past several years by the FDA. Although the CMS subsequently approved its first method of coverage and reimbursement for Yescarta and Kymriah, the methodology has been subject to challenge by members of Congress. CMS’s decision as to coverage and reimbursement for one product does not mean that all similar products will be eligible for analogous coverage and reimbursement. As there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement amongst third-party payors in the United States, even if CMS approves coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates, it is unclear what affect, if any, such a decision will have on our ability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from other private payors.
 Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are 
 21


inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. In addition, following the November 2016 Presidential election in the United States, significant uncertainty exists regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that there will be legislation in the future either to amend or replace the Affordable Care Act and that such new legislation will be generally unfavorable toward the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries (including with regard to a possible reduction in the number of insured individuals with access to drug coverage or additional measures aimed at high cost drug and biologic products). At this time, it is unclear whether those changes will also have an impact on biologic product exclusivity, or the biosimilar product licensure pathway established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. and other countries has increased, and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one reference member state (RMS), and submitting to more than one EU member state at the same time. The RMS National Competent Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Under the centralized procedure, within 120 days of receiving the marketing applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 In addition to regulations in the Europe Union and the United States, we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future products.
 Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
Employees
 As of February 28, 2019, we had 82 full-time employees, including a total of 14 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 60 employees are engaged in research and development and 22 in business development, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, information technology and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
