Overview

We are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the United States ("U.S.") Gulf Coast region. Our four primary business lines include:

• | Natural gas liquids transportation and distribution services and natural gas storage;


• | Terminalling and storage services for petroleum products and by-products, including the refining of naphthenic crude oil and the blending and packaging of finished lubricants;


• | Sulfur and sulfur-based products gathering, processing, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; and


• | Marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products.

The petroleum products and by-products we collect, transport, store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties, such as us, for the transportation and disposition of these products. In addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies, our primary customers include independent refiners, large chemical companies, fertilizer manufacturers and other wholesale purchasers of these products. We operate primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. This region is a major hub for petroleum refining, natural gas gathering and processing, and support services for the exploration and production industry.
We were formed in 2002 by Martin Resource Management, a privately-held company whose initial predecessor was incorporated in 1951 as a supplier of products and services to drilling rig contractors. Since then, Martin Resource Management has expanded its operations through acquisitions and internal expansion initiatives as its management identified 
and capitalized on the needs of producers and purchasers of petroleum products and by-products and other bulk liquids. Martin Resource Management is an important supplier and customer of ours. As of December 31, 2018, Martin Resource Management owned 15.7% of our total outstanding common limited partner units. Furthermore, Martin Resource Management controls Martin Midstream GP LLC ("MMGP"), our general partner, by virtue of its 51% voting interest in MMGP Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), the sole member of MMGP. MMGP owns a 2% general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. Martin Resource Management directs our business operations through its ownership interests in and control of our general partner. 
We entered into an omnibus agreement dated November 1, 2002, with Martin Resource Management (the "Omnibus Agreement") that governs, among other things, potential competition and indemnification obligations among the parties to the agreement, related party transactions, the provision of general administration and support services by Martin Resource Management and our use of certain of Martin Resource Management’s trade names and trademarks. Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement, the employees of Martin Resource Management are responsible for conducting our business and operating our assets. 
Martin Resource Management has operated our business since 2002.  Martin Resource Management began operating our natural gas services business in the 1950s and our sulfur business in the 1960s. It began our marine transportation business in the late 1980s. It entered into our fertilizer and terminalling and storage businesses in the early 1990s. Over the last 10 years, Martin Resource Management has increased the size of our asset base through expansions and strategic acquisitions.
Primary Business Segments

Our primary business segments can be generally described as follows:


• | Terminalling and Storage. We own or operate 19 marine shore-based terminal facilities and 14 specialty terminal facilities located primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region that provide storage, refining, blending, packaging, and handling services for producers and suppliers of petroleum products and by-products, including the refining of naphthenic crude oil and the blending and packaging of various grades and quantities of industrial, commercial, and automotive lubricants and greases. Our facilities and resources provide us with the ability to handle various products that require specialized treatment, such as molten sulfur and asphalt. We also provide land rental to oil and gas companies along with storage and handling services for lubricants and fuels. We provide these terminalling and storage services on a fee basis primarily under long-term contracts. A significant portion of the contracts in this segment provide for minimum fee arrangements that are not based on the volumes handled. 


• | Natural Gas Services. We distribute natural gas liquids ("NGLs"). We purchase NGLs primarily from refineries and natural gas processors. We store and transport NGLs for wholesale deliveries to refineries, industrial NGL users in Texas and the Southeastern U.S, and propane retailers. We own an NGL pipeline, which spans approximately 200 miles from Kilgore, Texas to Beaumont, Texas. We own approximately 2.4 million barrels of underground storage capacity for NGLs. Additionally, we own 100% of the interests in Cardinal Gas Storage Partners LLC ("Cardinal"), which is focused on the operation and management of natural gas storage facilities across northern Louisiana and Mississippi. 


• | Sulfur Services. We have developed an integrated system of transportation assets and facilities relating to sulfur services. We process and distribute sulfur produced by oil refineries primarily located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We buy and sell molten sulfur on contracts that are tied to sulfur indices and tend to provide stable margins. We process molten sulfur into prilled or pelletized sulfur at our facilities in Port of Stockton, California and Beaumont, Texas on contracts that often provide guaranteed minimum fees. The sulfur we process and handle is primarily used in the production of fertilizers and industrial chemicals. We own and operate five sulfur-based fertilizer production plants and one emulsified sulfur blending plant that manufactures primarily sulfur-based fertilizer products for wholesale distributors and industrial users. These plants are located in Texas and Illinois. Demand for our sulfur products exist in both the domestic and foreign markets, and our asset base provides additional opportunities to handle increases in U.S. supply and access to foreign demand. 


• | Marine Transportation. We operate a fleet of 31 inland marine tank barges, 17 inland push boats and one offshore tug and barge unit that transport petroleum products and by-products largely in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We provide these transportation services on a fee basis primarily under annual contracts, and many of our customers have long standing contractual relationships with us. Our modernized asset base is attractive both to our existing customers as well as potential new customers. In addition, our fleet contains several vessels that reflect our focus on specialty products. 

Significant Recent Developments
Martin Transport Inc. Stock Purchase Agreement. On October 22, 2018, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Martin Resource Management to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity of Martin Transport, Inc. (“MTI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Martin Resource Management which operates a fleet of tank trucks providing transportation of petroleum products, liquid petroleum gas, chemicals, sulfur and other products, as well as owns twenty-three terminals located throughout the Gulf Coast and Midwest for total consideration of $135.0 million with a $10.0 million earn-out based on certain performance thresholds. Additionally, a post-closing working capital adjustment was finalized on January 28, 2019 which included additional consideration paid to Martin Resource Management of $2.2 million. The Stock Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties. Martin Resource Management has owned and operated MTI or its predecessor for over 40 years and MTI is integral to our routine movements of sulfur and NGL’s. Based on operational estimates and current transportation market conditions, this drop-down from our general partner will provide strategic long-term growth for the Partnership. This transaction closed January 2, 2019 and was effective as of January 1, 2019. As of January 1, 2019, Martin Resource Management will no longer provide land transportation services. 
Divestiture of WTLPG Partnership Interest. On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our 20 percent non-operating interest in West Texas LPG Pipeline L.P. ("WTLPG") to ONEOK, Inc. (“ONEOK”). WTLPG owns an approximate 2,300 mile common-carrier pipeline system that primarily transports NGLs from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation. A wholly-owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc. is the operator of the assets. In consideration of the sale of these assets, we received cash proceeds of $195.0 million at closing, before transaction fees and expenses. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Credit Facility Amendment.  On February 21, 2018, we amended our revolving credit facility in order to achieve two primary objectives, the first of which was to accommodate growth capital expenditures necessary for the previously announced WTLPG expansion project. Starting in the first quarter of 2018, the amendment provided short-term (5 quarters) covenant relief by increasing the total leverage ratio to 5.75 to 1.00 (first and second quarters of 2018) with step downs to 5.50 to 1.00 (third and fourth quarters of 2018 and first quarter of 2019) and to 5.25 to 1.00 beginning in the second quarter of 2019. Additionally, the facility was amended to establish an inventory financing sublimit tranche for borrowings related to our NGL (butane) marketing business, which is a part of and not in addition to the already existing commitments under the revolving credit facility. This sublimit is not to exceed $75.0 million, with seasonal step downs to $10.0 million for the months of March through June of each fiscal year. The sublimit is subject to a monthly borrowing base not to exceed 90% of the value of forward sold/hedged inventory. In conjunction with the sale of WTLPG on July 31, 2018, we amended our revolving credit facility which included, among other things, further revising our leverage covenants from the February 21, 2018 amendment (discussed in detail above).  Total Indebtedness to EBITDA and Senior Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement) was amended to 5.25 times and 3.50 times, respectively.  No changes were made to the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of 2.50 times. 
Subsequent Events
Quarterly Distribution. On January 17, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.50 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2018, or $2.00 per common unit on an annualized basis, which will be paid on February 14, 2019 to unitholders of record as of February 7, 2019. 
Our Growth Strategy
The key components of our growth strategy are: 

• | Pursue Organic Growth Projects. We continually evaluate economically attractive organic expansion opportunities in existing areas of operation that will allow us to leverage our existing market position and increase the distributable cash flow from our existing assets through improved utilization and efficiency. 


• | Pursue Internal Organic Growth by Attracting New Customers and Expanding Services Provided to Existing Customers. Opportunities exist to expand our customer base and provide additional services and products to existing customers. We generally begin a relationship with a customer by transporting, storing or marketing a limited range of products and services. Expanding our customer base and our service and product offerings to existing customers is an efficient and cost effective method of achieving organic growth in revenues and cash flow. 


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We continually monitor the marketplace to identify and pursue accretive acquisitions that expand the services and products we offer or that expand our geographic presence. After acquiring other businesses, we attempt to utilize our industry knowledge, network of customers and suppliers and strategic asset base to operate the acquired businesses more efficiently and competitively, thereby increasing revenues and cash flow. Our diversified base of operations provides multiple platforms for strategic growth through acquisitions. 


• | Pursue Strategic Commercial Alliances. Many of our larger customers, which include major integrated energy companies, have established strategic alliances with midstream service providers such as us to address logistical and transportation problems or achieve operational synergies. We intend to pursue strategic commercial alliances with such customers in the future. 

Competitive Strengths
Fee-Based Contracts. We generate a majority of our cash flow from fee-based contracts with our customers. A significant portion of the fee-based contracts consist of reservation charges or minimum fee arrangements, which reduce the volatility of our cash flows due to volume fluctuations.
Asset Base and Integrated Distribution Network.  We operate a diversified asset base that enables us to offer our customers an integrated distribution network consisting of transportation, terminalling and storage and midstream logistical services for petroleum products and by-products.
Strategically Located Assets. A significant portion of our cash flow comes from providing various services to the oil refining industry.  Accordingly, a significant portion of our assets are located in proximity to refining operations along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  For example, we are one of the largest operators of marine service shore-based terminals in the U.S. Gulf Coast region providing broad geographic coverage and distribution capability of our products and services to our customers. Our natural gas storage and NGL distribution and storage assets are located in areas highly desirable for our customers. Finally, many of our sulfur services assets are strategically located to source sulfur from the largest refinery sources in the U.S.
Specialized Transportation Equipment and Storage Facilities.  We have the assets and expertise to handle and transport certain petroleum products and by-products with unique requirements for transportation and storage. For example, we own facilities and resources to transport a variety of specialty products, including ammonia, molten sulfur and asphalt. Some of these specialty products require treatment across a wide range of temperatures ranging between approximately -30 to +400 degrees Fahrenheit to remain in liquid form, which our facilities are designed to accommodate. These capabilities help us enhance relationships with our customers by offering them services to handle their unique product requirements.
Strong Industry Reputation and Established Relationships with Suppliers and Customers.  We have established a reputation in our industry as a reliable and cost-effective supplier of services to our customers and have a track record of safe, efficient operation of our facilities. Our management has also established long-term relationships with many of our suppliers and customers. We benefit from our management's reputation and track record and from these long-term relationships.
Experienced Management Team and Operational Expertise. Members of our executive management team and the heads of our principal business lines have a significant amount of experience in the industries in which we operate. Our management team has a successful track record of creating internal growth and completing acquisitions. Our management team's experience and familiarity with our industry and businesses are important assets that assist us in implementing our business strategies.
Terminalling and Storage Segment

Industry Overview.  The U.S. petroleum distribution system moves petroleum products and by-products from oil refineries and natural gas processing facilities to end users. This distribution system is comprised of a network of terminals, 
storage facilities, pipelines, tankers, barges, railcars and trucks. Terminals play a key role in moving these products throughout the distribution system by providing storage, blending and other ancillary services.

Although many large energy and chemical companies own terminalling and storage facilities, these companies also use third-party terminalling and storage services. Major energy and chemical companies typically have a strong demand for terminals owned by independent operators when such terminals are strategically located at or near key transportation links, such as deep-water ports. Major energy and chemical companies also need independent terminal storage when their owned storage facilities are inadequate, either because of lack of capacity, the nature of the stored material or specialized handling requirements.
The Gulf Coast region is a major hub for petroleum refining. Approximately 50% of U.S. refining capacity exists in this region. Growth in the refining and natural gas processing industries has increased the volume of petroleum products and by-products that are transported within the Gulf Coast region, which consequently has increased the need for terminalling and storage services.

The marine and offshore oil and gas exploration and production industries use terminal facilities in the Gulf Coast region as shore bases that provide them logistical support services as well as provide a broad range of products, including fuel oil, lubricants, chemicals and supplies. The demand for these types of terminals, services and products is driven primarily by offshore exploration, development and production in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore activity is greatly influenced by current and projected prices of oil and natural gas.

Specialty Petroleum Terminals.  We own or operate 12 terminalling facilities providing storage, handling and transportation of various petroleum products and by-products. The locations and capabilities of our terminals are structured to complement our other businesses and reflect our strategy to provide a broad range of integrated services in the storage, handling and transportation of products. We developed our terminalling and storage assets by acquisition and upgrades of existing facilities as well as developing our own properties strategically located near rail, waterways and pipelines. We anticipate further expansion of our terminalling facilities through both acquisition and organic growth. 
At the Neches and Stanolind terminals, our customers are primarily energy or petrochemical companies. We charge either a fixed monthly fee or a throughput fee for the use of our facilities based on the capacity of the applicable tank. We conduct a substantial portion of our terminalling and storage operations under long-term contracts, which enhances the stability and predictability of our operations and cash flow. We attempt to balance our short-term and long-term terminalling contracts in order to allow us to maintain a consistent level of cash flow while maintaining flexibility to earn higher storage revenues when demand for storage space increases. In addition, a significant portion of the contracts for our specialty terminals provide for minimum fee arrangements that are not based on the volume handled.
In Smackover, Arkansas, we own a refinery and terminal where we process crude oil into finished products that include naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other intermediates.  This process is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a long-term tolling agreement based on throughput rates and a monthly reservation fee.
In Smackover, Arkansas, we own and operate a terminal used for lubricant blending, processing, packaging, marketing and distribution. This terminal is used as our central hub for branded and private label packaged lubricants where we receive, package and ship heavy-duty, passenger car, and industrial lubricants to a network of retailers and distributors. 
In Kansas City, Missouri, we lease and operate a plant that specializes in the processing and packaging of automotive, commercial and industrial greases.
In Houston, Texas, we own and operate a plant that specializes in the processing and packaging of post tension greases.
In Hondo, Texas, we own an asphalt terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates.
In South Houston, Texas, we own an asphalt terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates.
In Port Neches, Texas, we own an asphalt terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based upon throughput rates.
In Omaha, Nebraska, we own an asphalt terminal whose use is dedicated to an affiliate of Martin Resource Management through a terminalling service agreement based on throughput rates.
In Beaumont, Texas we own a terminal where we receive natural gasoline via pipeline and then ship the product to our customers via other pipelines to which the facility is connected, referred to as the "Spindletop Terminal."  Our fees for the use of this facility are based on the volume of barrels shipped from the terminal.
The following is a summary description of our shore-based specialty terminals:

(1) | This terminal contains a warehouse owned by third parties and leased under a lease that expires in December 2020 and can be extended by us for two successive five-year periods.

Marine Shore-Based Terminals.  We own or operate 19 marine shore-based terminals along the Gulf Coast from Theodore, Alabama to Corpus Christi, Texas.   Our terminalling assets are located at strategic distribution points for the products we handle and are in close proximity to our customers. We are one of the largest operators of marine shore-based terminals in the Gulf Coast region. These terminals are used to distribute and market fuel and lubricants. Additionally, full service terminals also provide shore bases for companies that are operating in the offshore exploration and production industry. Customers are primarily oil and gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies, such as drilling fluid companies, marine transportation companies and offshore construction companies. Shore bases typically provide logistical support, including the storing and handling of tubular goods, loading and unloading bulk materials, providing facilities from which major and independent oil companies can communicate with and control offshore operations and leasing dockside facilities to companies which provide complementary products and services such as drilling fluids and cementing services. We generate revenues from our terminals that have shore bases by fees that we charge our customers under land rental contracts for the use of our terminal facility for these shore bases. These contracts generally provide us a fixed land rental fee and additional rental fees that are determined based on a percentage of the sales value of the products and services delivered from the shore base. In addition, Martin Resource Management, through terminalling service agreements, pays us for terminalling and storage of fuels and lubricants at these terminal facilities and includes a provision for minimum volume throughput requirements.

Our marine shore-based terminals are divided into two classes of terminals: (i) full service terminals and (ii) fuel and lubricant terminals.

Full Service Terminals.  We own or operate 6 full service terminals. These facilities provide logistical support services and storage and handling services for fuel and lubricants.  The significant difference between our full service terminals and our fuel and lubricant terminals is that our full service terminals generate additional revenues by providing shore bases to support our customer’s operating activities related to the offshore exploration and production industry. One typical use for our shore bases is for drilling fluids manufacturers to manufacture and sell drilling fluids to the offshore drilling industry. Offshore drilling companies may also set up service facilities at these terminals to support their offshore operations. Customers of our full service terminals are primarily oil and gas exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies such as drilling fluids companies, marine transportation companies and offshore construction companies.

The following is a summary description of our full service terminals:

Competition.  We compete with independent terminal operators and major energy and chemical companies that own their own terminalling and storage facilities. Many customers prefer to contract with independent terminal operators rather than terminal operators owned by integrated energy and chemical companies that may have refining or marketing interests that compete with the customers.
Independent terminal owners generally compete on the basis of the location and versatility of terminals, service and price. A favorably located terminal has access to various cost effective transportation modes, both to and from the terminal, such as waterways, railroads, roadways and pipelines. Terminal versatility depends upon the operator’s ability to handle diverse products, some of which have complex or specialized handling and storage requirements. The service function of a terminal includes, among other things, the safe storage of product at specified temperature, moisture and other conditions and receiving and delivering product to and from the terminal. All of these services must be in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations.
We successfully compete for terminal customers because of the strategic location of our terminals along the Gulf Coast, our integrated transportation services, our reputation, the prices we charge for our services and the quality and versatility of our services. Additionally, while some companies have significantly more terminalling and storage capacity than us, not all terminalling and storage facilities located in the markets we serve are equipped to properly handle specialty products such as asphalt, sulfur and anhydrous ammonia. 
The principal competitive factors affecting our terminals, which provide fuel and lubricants distribution and marketing, as well as shore bases at certain terminals, are the locations of the facilities, availability of competing logistical support services and the experience of personnel and dependability of service. The distribution and marketing of our lubricant products is brand sensitive and we encounter brand loyalty competition. Shore base rental contracts are generally long-term contracts and provide more protection from competition. Our primary competitors for both lubricants and shore bases include several independent operators as well as major companies that maintain their own similarly equipped marine terminals, shore bases and fuel and lubricant supply sources.
 Natural Gas Services Segment

Industry Overview.  NGLs are produced through natural gas processing and as a by-product of crude oil refining. NGLs include ethane, propane, normal butane, iso butane and natural gasoline.
Ethane is almost entirely used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene.  Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a fuel for heating, for industrial applications, as motor fuel and as a refrigerant.  Normal butane is used as a petrochemical feedstock, as a blend stock for motor gasoline and as a component in aerosol propellants.  Normal butane can also be made into iso butane through isomerization.  Iso butane is used in the production of motor gasoline, alkylation and as a component in aerosol propellants.  Natural gasoline is used as a component of motor gasoline, as a petrochemical feedstock and as a diluent.
Facilities.  We purchase NGLs primarily from major domestic oil refiners and natural gas processors.  We transport NGLs using MTI’s land transportation fleet or by contracting with common carriers, owner-operators and railroad tank cars. We typically enter into annual contracts with independent retail propane distributors to deliver their estimated annual volume requirements based on prevailing market prices. Dependable delivery is very important to these customers and in some cases may be more important than price. We ensure adequate supply of NGLs through:

• | storage of NGLs ;


• | efficient use of railroad tank cars


• | the transportation fleet of vehicles owned by MTI; and


• | product management expertise to obtain supplies when needed.

The following is a summary description of our owned NGL facilities:
NGL Facility | Location | Capacity | Description 
Wholesale terminals | Arcadia, Louisiana | 2,400,000 barrels | Underground storage 
Retail terminals | Kilgore, Texas | 90,000 gallons | Retail propane distribution 
 | Longview, Texas | 30,000 gallons | Retail propane distribution 
 | Henderson, Texas | 12,000 gallons | Retail propane distribution 
Rail terminal | Arcadia, Louisiana | 24 railcars per day | NGL railcar loading and unloading capabilities

In addition to the owned NGL facilities above, we lease underground storage capacity at four locations under short-term lease agreements. 
Our NGL customers consist of refiners, industrial processors and retail propane distributors. The majority of our NGL volumes are sold to refiners and industrial processors. 
Seasonality.  The level of NGL supply and demand is subject to changes in domestic production, weather, inventory levels and other factors. While production is not seasonal, residential, refinery, and wholesale demand is highly seasonal. This imbalance causes increases in inventories during summer months when consumption is low and decreases in inventories during winter months when consumption is high. In September, demand for normal butane typically increases with refineries entering 
the winter gasoline-blending season, resulting in upward pressure on prices. Abnormally cold weather can put extra upward pressure on propane prices during the winter.
Competition.  We compete with large integrated NGL producers and marketers, as well as small local independent marketers. The primary components of competition related to our natural gas storage operations are location, rates, terms and flexibility of service and supply. Our natural gas storage facilities compete with other storage providers and increased competition could result from newly developed storage facilities or expanded capacity from existing competitors.
Natural Gas Storage
Natural gas storage facilities provide a staging and warehousing function for seasonal swings in demand relative to supply, as well as an essential reliability cushion against disruptions in natural gas supply, demand and transportation by allowing natural gas to be injected into, withdrawn from or warehoused in such storage facilities as dictated by market conditions. The long term demand for storage services in the U.S. is driven primarily by the long-term demand for natural gas and the overall lack of balance between the supply of and demand for natural gas on a seasonal, monthly, daily or other basis. In general and on a long-term basis, to the extent the overall demand for natural gas increases and such growth includes higher demand from seasonal or weather-sensitive end-users (such as gas-fired power generators and residential and commercial consumers), demand for natural gas storage services should also grow. In addition, any factors that contribute to more frequent and severe imbalances between the supply of and demand for natural gas, whether caused by supply or demand fluctuations, should increase the need for and the value of storage services. On a short term basis, storage demand and values are also significantly influenced by operational imbalances, near term seasonal spreads, shorter term spreads and basis differentials.
We own 100% of the interests in Cardinal, which is focused on the operation and management of natural gas storage facilities across northern Louisiana and Mississippi. 
Cardinal facilities are summarized below:

Facility Name / Location | Facility Type | Working Storage Capacity | Percent of Capacity Contracted (1) | Weighted Average Life of Remaining Contract Term

These facilities were developed to provide producers, end users, local distribution companies, pipelines and energy marketers with high-deliverability storage services and hub services. 

Sulfur Services Segment

Industry Overview.  Sulfur is a natural element and is required to produce a variety of industrial products. In the U.S., approximately 9 million tons of sulfur are consumed annually with the Tampa, Florida area being the largest single market. Currently, all sulfur produced in the U.S. is "recovered sulfur," or sulfur that is a by-product from oil refineries and natural gas processing plants.  Sulfur production in the U.S. is principally located along the Gulf Coast, along major inland waterways and in some areas of the western U.S.

Sulfur is an important plant nutrient and is primarily used in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers and other industrial purposes. The primary application of sulfur in fertilizers occurs in the form of sulfuric acid. Burning sulfur creates sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently oxidized and dissolved in water to create sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is then combined with phosphate rock to make phosphoric acid, the base material for most high-grade phosphate fertilizers.

Sulfur-based fertilizers are manufactured chemicals containing nutrients known to improve the fertility of soils. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur are the four most important nutrients for crop growth.  These nutrients are found naturally in soils. However, soils used for agriculture become depleted of nutrients and require fertilizers rich in nutrients to restore fertility.

Industrial sulfur products (including sulfuric acid) are used in a wide variety of industries. For example, these products are used in power plants, paper mills, auto and tire manufacturing plants, food processing plants, road construction, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

Our Operations and Products.  We maintain an integrated system of transportation assets and facilities relating to our sulfur services.  We gather molten sulfur from refiners, primarily located on the Gulf Coast. We transport sulfur by inland and offshore barges, railcars and trucks.  In the U.S., recovered sulfur is mainly kept in liquid form from production to usage at a temperature of approximately 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the temperature requirement, the sulfur industry uses specialized equipment to store and transport molten sulfur. We have the necessary assets and expertise to handle the unique requirements for transportation and storage of molten sulfur.

Terms for our standard purchase and sales contracts typically range from one to two years in length with prices that are usually tied to a published market indicator and fluctuate according to the price movement of the indicator. We also provide barge transportation and tank storage services to large producers and consumers of sulfur under contracts with remaining terms from one to five years in duration.

We operate sulfur forming assets in the Port of Stockton, California and Beaumont, Texas, which are used to convert molten sulfur into solid form (prills/granules). The Stockton facility is equipped with one wet prill unit capable of processing 1,000 metric tons of molten sulfur per day. The Beaumont facility is equipped with two wet prill units and one granulation unit capable of processing a combined 5,500 metric tons of molten sulfur per day. Formed sulfur at both facilities is stored in bulk until sold into local or international agricultural markets. Our forming services contracts are fee based and typically include minimum fee guarantees.
Our sulfuric acid production facility at our Plainview, Texas location processes molten sulfur to produce a dedicated supply of raw material sulfuric acid to our ammonium sulfate production plant.  The ammonium sulfate plant produces approximately 400 tons per day of quality ammonium sulfate and is marketed to our customers throughout the U.S.  The sulfuric acid produced and not consumed by the captive ammonium sulfate production is sold to third parties.
Fertilizer and related sulfur products are a natural extension of our molten sulfur business because of our access to sulfur and our distribution capabilities. 

In the U.S., fertilizer is generally sold to farmers through local dealers.  These dealers are typically owned and supplied by much larger wholesale distributors. We sell to these wholesale distributors.  Our industrial sulfur products are marketed primarily in the southern U.S., where many paper manufacturers and power plants are located.  Our products are sold in accordance with price lists that vary from state to state. These price lists are updated periodically to reflect changes in seasonal or competitive prices.  We transport our fertilizer and industrial sulfur products to our customers using third-party common carriers.  We utilize barge and rail shipments for large volume and long distance shipments where available.

We manufacture and market the following sulfur-based fertilizer and related sulfur products:


• | Plant nutrient sulfur products. We produce plant nutrient and agricultural ground sulfur products at our facilities in Odessa, Texas, Seneca, Illinois and Cactus, Texas. Our plant nutrient sulfur product is a 90% degradable sulfur product marketed under the Disper-Sul® trade name and sold throughout the U.S. to direct application agricultural markets. 


• | Ammonium sulfate products. We produce various grades of ammonium sulfate including granular, coarse, standard, and 40% ammonium sulfate solution. These products primarily serve direct application agricultural markets. We package these custom grade products under both proprietary and private labels and sell them to major retail distributors and other retail customers. 


• | Industrial sulfur products. We produce industrial sulfur products such as elemental pastille sulfur, industrial ground sulfur products, and emulsified sulfur. We produce elemental pastille sulfur at our Odessa, Texas and Seneca, Illinois facilities. Elemental pastille sulfur is used to increase the efficiency of the coal-fired precipitators in the power industry. These industrial ground sulfur products are also used in a variety of dusting and wettable 

sulfur applications such as rubber manufacturing, fungicides, sugar and animal feeds. We produce emulsified sulfur at our Nash, Texas facility. Emulsified sulfur is primarily used to control the sulfur content in the pulp and paper manufacturing processes. 

• | Liquid sulfur products. We produce ammonium thiosulfate at our Neches terminal facility in Beaumont, Texas. This agricultural sulfur product is a clear liquid containing 12% nitrogen and 26% sulfur. This product serves as a liquid plant nutrient used directly through spray rigs or irrigation systems. It is also blended with other nitrogen phosphorus potassium liquids or suspensions as well. Our market is predominantly the Mid-South U.S. and Coastal Bend area of Texas. 

Our Sulfur Services Facilities. We own 26 railcars and lease 42 railcars equipped to transport molten sulfur. We own the following marine assets and use them to transport molten sulfur between U.S. Gulf Coast storage terminals (including our terminal in Beaumont, Texas) under third-party marine transportation agreements:

Asset | Class of Equipment | Capacity/Horsepower | Products Transported
Margaret Sue | Offshore tank barge | 10,500 long tons | Molten sulfur 
M/V Martin Explorer | Offshore tugboat | 7,130 horsepower | N/A 
M/V Martin Express | Inland push boat | 1,200 horsepower | N/A 
MGM 101 | Inland tank barge | 2,500 long tons | Molten sulfur 
MGM 102 | Inland tank barge | 2,500 long tons | Molten sulfur 


We operate the following sulfur forming facilities as part of our sulfur services business: 

Terminal | Location | Daily Production Capacity | Products Stored 
Neches | Beaumont, Texas | 5,500 metric tons per day | Molten, prilled and granulated sulfur
Stockton | Stockton, California | 1,000 metric tons per day | Molten and prilled sulfur 

We lease 132 railcars to transport our fertilizer products.  We own the following manufacturing plants as part of our sulfur services business:

Facility | Location | Annual Capacity | Description 
Fertilizer plant | Plainview, Texas | 150,000 tons | Fertilizer production 
Fertilizer plant | Beaumont, Texas | 110,000 tons | Liquid sulfur fertilizer production
Fertilizer plants | Odessa, Texas | 35,000 tons | Dry sulfur fertilizer production 
Fertilizer plant | Seneca, Illinois | 36,000 tons | Dry sulfur fertilizer production 
Fertilizer plant | Cactus, Texas | 20,000 tons | Dry sulfur fertilizer production 
Industrial sulfur plant | Nash, Texas | 18,000 tons | Emulsified sulfur production 
Sulfuric acid plant | Plainview, Texas | 150,000 tons | Sulfuric acid production 


Competition.  The Martin Explorer/Margaret Sue articulated barge unit is one of four vessels currently used to transport molten sulfur between U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa, Florida. Phosphate fertilizer manufacturers consume a majority of the sulfur produced in the U.S., which they purchase directly from both producers and resellers. As a reseller, we compete against producers and other resellers capable of accessing the required transportation and storage assets. Our sulfur-based fertilizer products compete with several large fertilizer and sulfur product manufacturers.  However, the close proximity of our manufacturing plants to our customer base is a competitive advantage for us in the markets we serve and allows us to minimize freight costs and respond quickly to customer requests. Our sulfuric acid products compete with regional producers and importers in the South and Southwest portion of the U.S. from Louisiana to California.  

Seasonality.  Sales of our agricultural fertilizer products are partly seasonal as a result of increased demand during the growing season.
Marine Transportation Segment

Industry Overview.  The inland waterway system is composed of a network of interconnected rivers and canals that serve as water highways and is used to transport vast quantities of products annually. This waterway system extends approximately 26,000 miles, of which 12,000 miles are generally considered significant for domestic commerce.

The Gulf Coast region is a major hub for petroleum refining. The petroleum refining process generates products and by-products that require transportation in large quantities from the refinery or processor. Convenient access to and use of this waterway system by the petroleum and petrochemical industry is a major reason for the current location of U.S. refineries and petrochemical facilities. The marine transportation industry uses push boats and tugboats as power sources and tank barges for freight capacity. The combination of the power source and tank barge freight capacity is called a tow.

Marine Fleet.  We utilize a fleet of inland and offshore tows that provide marine transportation of petroleum products and by-products produced in oil refining and natural gas processing. Our marine transportation business operates coastwise along the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast and on the U.S. inland waterway system, primarily between domestic ports along the Gulf of Mexico, Intracoastal Waterway, the Mississippi River system and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway system. Our inland tows generally consist of one push boat and one to three tank barges, depending upon the horsepower of the push boat, the river or canal capacity and conditions, and customer requirements. Our offshore tow consists of one tugboat, with much greater horsepower than an inland push boat, and one large tank barge. We transport asphalt, fuel oil, gasoline, sulfur and other bulk liquids. 

The following is a summary description of the marine vessels we use in our marine transportation business (excluding equipment classified as Assets Held for Sale): 
Class of Equipment | Number in Class | Capacity/Horsepower | Description of Products Carried 
Inland tank barges | 7 | Under 20,000 barrels | Asphalt, crude oil, fuel oil, gasoline and sulfur
Inland tank barges | 24 | 20,000 - 31,000 barrels | Asphalt, crude oil, fuel oil and gasoline 
Inland push boats | 17 | 800 - 2,650 horsepower | N/A 
Offshore tank barge | 1 | 59,000 barrels | Diesel fuel 
Offshore tugboat | 1 | 5,100 horsepower | N/A 

Our largest marine transportation customers include major and independent oil and gas refining companies, petroleum marketing companies and Martin Resource Management. We conduct our marine transportation services on a fee basis primarily under spot contracts.

We are a party to a marine transportation agreement under which we provide marine transportation services to Martin Resource Management on a spot contract basis at applicable market rates.  Effective each January 1, this agreement automatically renews for consecutive one-year periods unless either party terminates the agreement by giving written notice to the other party at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then-applicable term.

Competition.  We compete primarily with other marine transportation companies. Competition in this industry has historically been based primarily on price. However, customers are placing an increased emphasis on the age of equipment, safety, environmental compliance, quality of service and the availability of a single source of supply of services. 

In addition to competitors that provide marine transportation services, we also compete with providers of other modes of transportation, such as rail, trucks and, to a lesser extent, pipelines. For example, a typical two inland barge unit carries a volume of product equal to approximately 80 railcars or 250 tanker trucks. Pipelines generally provide a less expensive form of transportation than marine transportation. However, pipelines are not able to transport most of the products we transport and are generally a less flexible form of transportation because they are limited to the fixed point-to-point distribution of commodities in high volumes over extended periods of time.

Approval and Review of Related Party Transactions
If we contemplate entering into a transaction, other than a routine or in the ordinary course of business transaction, in which a related person will have a direct or indirect material interest, the proposed transaction is submitted for consideration to the board of directors of our general partner or to our management, as appropriate. If the board of directors is involved in the approval process, it determines whether to refer the matter to the Conflicts Committee, as provided under our limited partnership agreement. If a matter is referred to the Conflicts Committee, it obtains information regarding the proposed transaction from management and determines whether to engage independent legal counsel or an independent financial advisor to advise the members of the committee regarding the transaction.  If the Conflicts Committee retains such counsel or financial advisor, it considers such advice and, in the case of a financial advisor, such advisor’s opinion as to whether the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and to our unitholders.
Insurance
Our deductible for onshore physical damage resulting from named windstorms is 5% of the total value located at an individual location subject to an overall minimum deductible of $1.0 million for damage caused by the named windstorm at all locations excluding Neches Industrial Park. Our onshore program currently provides $40.0 million per occurrence for named windstorm events. For non-windstorm events, our deductible applicable to onshore physical damage is $0.5 million per occurrence. Business interruption coverage in connection with a windstorm event is subject to the same $40.0 million per occurrence and aggregate limit as the property damage coverage and has a waiting period of 45 days. For non-windstorm events, our waiting period applicable to business interruption is 30 days.
We have various pollution liability policies which provide coverages ranging from remediation of our property to third party liability. The limits of these policies vary based on our assessments of exposure at each location.
Loss of, or damage to, our vessels and cargo is insured through hull and cargo insurance policies. Vessel operating liabilities such as collision, cargo, environmental and personal injury are insured primarily through our participation in mutual insurance associations and other reinsurance arrangements, pursuant to which we are potentially exposed to assessments in the event claims by us or other members exceed available funds and reinsurance. Protection and indemnity ("P&I") insurance coverage is provided by P&I associations and other insurance underwriters. Our vessels are entered in P&I associations that are parties to a pooling agreement, known as the International Group Pooling Agreement ("Pooling Agreement") through which approximately 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage is reinsured through a group reinsurance policy. With regard to collision coverage, the first $1.0 million of coverage is insured by our hull policy and any excess is insured by a P&I association. We insure our owned cargo through a domestic insurance company. We insure cargo owned by third parties through our P&I coverage. As a member of P&I associations that are parties to the Pooling Agreement, we are subject to supplemental calls payable to the associations of which we are a member, based on our claims record and the other members of the other P&I associations that are parties to the Pooling Agreement. Except for our marine operations, we self-insure against liability exposure up to a predetermined amount, beyond which we are covered by catastrophe insurance coverage.
For marine claims, our insurance covers up to $1.0 billion of liability per accident or occurrence. We believe our current insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against most accident related risks involved in the conduct of our business. However, there can be no assurance that all risks are adequately insured against, that any particular claim will be paid by the insurer, or that we will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Our activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety and other matters.
Environmental

We are subject to complex federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health, natural resources and the environment. These laws and regulations can impair our operations that affect the environment in many ways, such as requiring the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; restricting the manner in which we can release materials into the environment; requiring remedial activities or capital expenditures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and imposing substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Many environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several, strict liability, and any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and, in some circumstances, the issuance of injunctions that can limit or prohibit our operations.
The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and, thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum products and by-products, chemical substances, and wastes as well as the accidental release or spill of such materials into the environment. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as result of such handling practices, releases or spills, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons. In the event of future increases in costs, we may be unable to pass on those increases to our customers. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements would not have a material adverse impact on us, we cannot provide any assurance that our environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.
Superfund

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, ("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, and similar state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of "responsible persons," including the owner or operator of a site where regulated hazardous substances have been released into the environment and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at such site. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Although certain hydrocarbons are not subject to CERCLA’s reach because "petroleum" is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a "hazardous substance," in the course of our ordinary operations we will generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a "hazardous substance." In addition, some state counterparts to CERCLA tie liability to a broader set of substances than does CERCLA. 
Solid Waste

We generate both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes, which are subject to requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has considered making changes in nonhazardous waste standards that would result in stricter disposal requirements for these wastes. Furthermore, it is possible some wastes generated by us that are currently classified as nonhazardous may in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes," resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Changes in applicable regulations may result in an increase in our capital expenditures or operating expenses.

We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for the manufacturing, processing, transportation and storage of petroleum products and by-products. Solid waste disposal practices within oil and gas related industries have improved over the years with the passage and implementation of various environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, a possibility exists that petroleum and other solid wastes may have been disposed of on or under various properties owned or leased by us during the operating history of those facilities. In addition, a number of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we had no control as to such entities’ handling of petroleum, petroleum by-products or other wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed of or released. State and federal laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties have gradually become more strict and, under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including groundwater contamination, even under circumstances where such contamination resulted from past operations of third parties.
Clean Air Act

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA"), as amended, and comparable state statutes. Amendments to the CAA adopted in 1990 contain provisions that may result in the imposition of increasingly stringent pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of our terminal facilities, processing and storage facilities and fertilizer and related products manufacturing and processing facilities. Such air pollution control requirements may include specific equipment or technologies to control emissions, permits with emissions and operational limitations, pre-approval of new or modified projects or facilities producing air emissions, and similar measures. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and/or result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources. We believe our operations, including our manufacturing, processing and storage facilities and terminals, are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of the CAA and analogous state laws.

Global Warming and Climate Change.  Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as "greenhouse gases" and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  In response to such studies, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered climate change-related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions.  Many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.  Also, as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, the EPA eventually concluded that it is required to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources (e.g., cars and trucks) even if Congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases.  The Court's holding in Massachusetts that greenhouse gases fall under the federal CAA's definition of air pollutant has 
also led the EPA to determine that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under various Clean Air Act programs is required.  To that end, EPA promulgated regulations, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Red. 31514, to begin gradually subjecting stationary greenhouse gas emission sources to various Clean Air Act programs, including permitting programs applicable to new and existing major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.  In reviewing the regulations at issue, the Supreme Court struck down EPA’s permitting requirements as applicable only to greenhouse gas emissions, although it upheld the EPA’s authority to control greenhouse gas emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants.
On an international level, almost 200 nations agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its emissions targets. Although the present administration has announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord, such withdrawal has not yet been finalized. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international climate change agreement. Further, several states and local governments have stated their commitment to its principles in their effectuation of policy and regulations. To date, applicable requirements have not had a substantial effect upon our operations.  Still, new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could adversely affect our operations and demand for our services.
Moreover, in interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our business activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or floods, or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. In addition, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change. 
Clean Water Act

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including hydrocarbon-bearing wastes, into state waters and waters of the U.S. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and similar state laws, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, or a state permit, or both, must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal and state waters. In addition, the Clean Water Act and comparable state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by subject facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. Furthermore, the Clean Water Act potentially requires individual permits or qualification for nationwide permits for activities that involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, the definition of which was expanded by the EPA and Corps of Engineers in a 2015 rulemaking. The 2015 rule, if it were to become effective, could significantly expand federal control of land and water resources across the U.S., triggering substantial additional permitting and regulatory requirements to which our operations may be subject from time to time. The EPA and the Corps subsequently proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the 2015 rule and also announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction. The EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years. On December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction. A nationwide patchwork of litigation and court rulings developed regarding the rules. At this time, due to varied court rulings, the 2015 rule is effective in some states, while the agencies’ decision to delay implementation of the 2015 rule is effective in other states. If finalized, the 2018 proposed rule would apply nationwide, replacing the national patchwork of CWA jurisdictional applicability. Additionally, if finalized, it is possible that the 2018 proposed rule could be challenged. The scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction will likely remain fluid until a final regulatory determination is made and subsequent litigation, if any, is finalized. To the extent a rule ultimately promulgated expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to permitting. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed thereunder, and that our continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Oil Pollution Act

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended ("OPA") imposes a variety of regulations on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in U.S. waters. A "responsible party" includes 
the owner or operator of a facility or vessel or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including natural resource damages. Under the OPA, vessels and shore facilities handling, storing, or transporting oil are required to develop and implement oil spill response plans, and vessels greater than 300 tons in weight must provide to the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility to cover the costs of cleaning up oil spills from such vessels. The OPA also requires that all newly constructed tank barges engaged in oil transportation in the U.S. be double hulled effective January 1, 2016. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all of the oil spill-related and financial responsibility requirements. Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, Congress has from time to time considered oil spill related legislation that could have the effect of substantially increasing financial responsibility requirements and potential fines and damages for violations and discharges subject to the OPA, and similar legislation.  Any such changes in law affecting areas where we conduct business could materially affect our operations.
Safety Regulation

The Company’s marine transportation operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard, federal laws, state laws and certain international treaties. Tank ships, push boats, tugboats and barges are required to meet construction and repair standards established by the American Bureau of Shipping, a private organization, and the U.S. Coast Guard and to meet operational and safety standards presently established by the U.S. Coast Guard. We believe our marine operations and our terminals are in substantial compliance with current applicable safety requirements.
Occupational Health Regulations

The workplaces associated with our manufacturing, processing, terminal and storage facilities are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. We believe we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.  Our marine vessel operations are also subject to safety and operational standards established and monitored by the U.S. Coast Guard.

In general, we expect to increase our expenditures relating to compliance with likely higher industry and regulatory safety standards such as those described above. These expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, but we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business.

Jones Act

The Jones Act is a federal law that restricts maritime transportation between locations in the U.S. to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. Since we engage in maritime transportation between locations in the U.S., we are subject to the provisions of the law. As a result, we are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our subsidiaries that engage in maritime transportation and for taking any remedial action necessary to ensure that no violation of the Jones Act ownership restrictions occurs. The Jones Act also requires that all U.S.-flagged vessels be manned by U.S. citizens. Foreign-flagged seamen generally receive lower wages and benefits than those received by U.S. citizen seamen. This requirement significantly increases operating costs of U.S.-flagged vessel operations compared to foreign-flagged vessel operations. Certain foreign governments subsidize their nations’ shipyards. This results in lower shipyard costs both for new vessels and repairs than those paid by U.S.-flagged vessel owners. The U.S. Coast Guard and American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regimen of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flagged operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience. 
Merchant Marine Act of 1936

The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law that provides that, upon proclamation by the President of the U.S. of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of our push boats, tugboats or tank barges were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, if one of our push boats or tugboats is requisitioned or purchased and its associated tank barge is left idle, we would not be entitled to receive any compensation for the lost revenues resulting from the idled barge. We also would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer as a result of the requisition or purchase of any of our push boats, tugboats or tank barges.
