 Item 1.    Business 
 Our Company
 We are a commercial biotechnology company leveraging our proven development and commercial capabilities as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. In May 2018, we announced our intent to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies – Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Ironwood. and Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or Cyclerion. Following the completion of the planned separation, Ironwood will be a gastrointestinal, or GI, focused healthcare company leveraging our proven development and commercial capabilities as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We are advancing innovative product opportunities in areas of large unmet need, capitalizing on our expertise in GI diseases. Cyclerion will be a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company harnessing the power of sGC pharmacology to discover, develop and commercialize breakthrough treatments for serious and orphan diseases.
 Our commercial product, linaclotide, is available to adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS‑C, or chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, in certain countries around the world. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name LINZESS® to adult men and women suffering from IBS‑C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., and Mexico, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries. 
 We and our U.S. linaclotide partner Allergan plc (together with its affiliates), or Allergan, are exploring ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In July 2018, we announced the initiation of a Phase IIIb trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of linaclotide 290 mcg on multiple abdominal symptoms including pain, bloating and discomfort, in adult patients with IBS-C.
 We and Allergan are also seeking to expand the clinical utility of linaclotide by demonstrating the pain-relieving effect of a delayed release formulation through the advancement of MD-7246 (linaclotide delayed release) in IBS with diarrhea, or IBS-D. 
 We are advancing another GI development program, IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant for the potential treatment of persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease, or persistent GERD. In June 2018, we initiated two Phase III clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of IW-3718 in patients with persistent GERD.
 The following table presents the status of selected key development programs in our pipeline:

 The status of our development programs in the table above represents the ongoing phase of development and does not correspond to the completion of a particular phase. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
 We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide and the commercialization of lesinurad, as part of our uncontrolled gout program, which we are in the process of discontinuing, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates.
 GI Programs
 IBS‑C / CIC
 IBS‑C and CIC are chronic, functional GI disorders that afflict millions of sufferers worldwide. As many as 13 million adults suffer from IBS‑C and as many as 35 million adults suffer from CIC in the U.S. alone, according to our analysis of studies including P Pare, et al. (published in 2001 in the American Journal of Gastroenterology) and J.F. Johanson, et al. (published in 2007 in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics) and American College of Gastroenterology Chronic Constipation Task Force (2005), American Journal of Gastroenterology Vol. 100, No. S1, 2005. Symptoms of IBS‑C include abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating and constipation symptoms (e.g., incomplete evacuation, infrequent bowel movements, hard/lumpy stools), while CIC is primarily characterized by constipation symptoms.
 Linaclotide—U.S. In August 2012, the FDA approved LINZESS as a once‑daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS‑C (290mcg dose) or CIC (145mcg dose). We and Allergan began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. In January 2017, the FDA approved a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide for the treatment of adult men and women with CIC. Linaclotide is the first product approved by the FDA in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type‑C, or GC‑C, agonists. We and Allergan continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions.
 Additional Abdominal Symptom Claims. We and Allergan have identified a development path with LINZESS intended to obtain abdominal symptom claims including bloating and discomfort, two highly bothersome symptoms associated with IBS-C, through a single Phase III trial. Greater than 65% of IBS-C patients suffer from bloating and/or discomfort at least one time per week, according to the Lieberman GI Patient Landscape Survey performed in 2010. In July 2018, we and Allergan initiated a Phase IIIb clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of linaclotide 290 mcg on multiple abdominal symptoms in addition to pain, including bloating and discomfort in adult patients with IBS-C. 
 Pediatrics. We and Allergan have established a nonclinical and clinical post‑marketing plan with the FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. We and Allergan are advancing clinical pediatric programs in IBS‑C patients age seven to 17 and functional constipation patients age six to 17.
 LINZESS is covered by a U.S. composition of matter patent that expires in 2026, including patent term extension, as well as multiple additional patents covering the commercial formulation of LINZESS and methods of using this formulation to treat patients with IBS C or CIC, the latest of which expire in the early 2030s. We and Allergan have received Paragraph IV certification notice letters, or Notice Letters, regarding Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, submitted to the FDA by generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of linaclotide capsules (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of LINZESS. In 2018, we and Allergan entered into settlement agreements with three generic drug manufacturers. For additional information relating to such ANDAs and any resolution of related litigation, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Linaclotide—Global. Allergan has rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries worldwide other than China, Hong Kong, Macau and Japan. In November 2012, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to CONSTELLA for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS‑C in adults. CONSTELLA is 

 
  6

 
the first, and to date, only drug approved in the European Union, or E.U., for IBS‑C. CONSTELLA first became commercially available in certain European countries beginning in the second quarter of 2013. Allergan is commercializing CONSTELLA in a number of European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. 
 In December 2013 and February 2014, linaclotide was approved in Canada and Mexico, respectively, as a treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS‑C or CIC. Allergan has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS. In May 2014, CONSTELLA became commercially available in Canada and in June 2014, LINZESS became commercially available in Mexico. 
 Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, has rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. In December 2016, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C in Japan.  In March 2017, Astellas began commercializing LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C in Japan. In August 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LINZESS for the treatment of adults with chronic constipation in Japan. In September 2018, Astellas began commercializing LINZESS for the treatment of adult patients with chronic constipation in Japan.
 We and AstraZeneca are co‑developing linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca having primary responsibility for the local operational execution. In January 2019, the National Medical Products Administration approved the marketing application for LINZESS for adults with IBS-C in China. 
 CONSTELLA is covered by European composition of matter patents, which expire in 2024. LINZESS is covered by Japanese composition of matter patents and commercial formulation patents which expire between 2024 and 2032. In addition, we have Chinese composition of matter patents and commercial formulation patents which expire between 2024 and 2032.
 Abdominal Pain associated with IBS
 MD-7246. There are an estimated 16 million Americans who suffer from symptoms of IBS-D, according to Grundmann and Yoon in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment: an update for health-care practitioners (published in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2010) and the United States Census Bureau. 
 We and Allergan are initially exploring MD-7246 as an oral, intestinal, non-opioid, pain-relieving agent for patients suffering from IBS with diarrhea. 
 Persistent GERD
 IW‑3718. There are an estimated 10 million Americans who suffer regularly from symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation, despite receiving treatment with the current standard of care, a proton pump inhibitor, to suppress stomach acid, according to a study published in 2010 by H. El-Sarag in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics and 2015 U.S. census data. Research suggests some persistent GERD patients may experience reflux of bile from the intestine into the stomach and esophagus.
 We are advancing IW‑3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant, for the potential treatment of persistent GERD. Our clinical research has demonstrated that reflux of bile from the intestine into the stomach and esophagus plays a key role in the ongoing symptoms of persistent GERD. IW-3718 is a novel formulation of a bile acid sequestrant designed to release in the stomach over an extended period of time, bind to bile that refluxes into the stomach, and potentially provide symptomatic relief in patients with persistent GERD. In June 2018, we initiated two Phase III clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of IW-3718 in patients with persistent GERD.

 Uncontrolled Gout Programs
 In June 2016, we closed a transaction with AstraZeneca, or the Lesinurad Transaction, pursuant to which we received an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize in the U.S. products containing lesinurad as an active ingredient, or the Lesinurad License, including ZURAMPIC® and DUZALLO® In January 2018, we commenced an initiative to evaluate the optimal mix of investments for our lesinurad franchise for uncontrolled gout, including DUZALLO and ZURAMPIC. As part of this effort, in 2018 we began re-allocating resources within our lesinurad franchise to systematically explore a more comprehensive marketing mix in select test markets (with paired controls), while continuing to build market presence for the lesinurad franchise across the country. In July 2018, we obtained and analyzed the results from the lesinurad franchise test markets. Data from the test markets did not meet expectations. In connection with the results, our Board of Directors determined on July 31, 2018 to terminate the lesinurad license agreement. Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc.
 Cyclerion, the company that is expected to spin out of Ironwood following the completion of the planned separation, is expected to be a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company intended to harness the power of sGC pharmacology to discover, develop and commercialize breakthrough treatments for serious and orphan diseases. The company plans to focus on enabling the full therapeutic potential of next generation sGC stimulators. sGC stimulators are small molecules that act synergistically with nitric oxide on sGC to boost production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP. cGMP is a key second messenger that, when produced by sGC, regulates diverse and critical biological functions throughout the body including blood flow and vascular dynamics, inflammatory and fibrotic processes, metabolism and neuronal function. Cyclerion believes that the key to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of the nitric oxide cGMP pathway is to design differentiated next generation sGC stimulators that preferentially modulate pathway signaling in tissues of greatest relevance to the diseases they are developed to treat. This targeted approach is intended to maximize the potential benefits of nitric oxide cGMP pathway stimulation in disease relevant tissues. 
 Cyclerion’s portfolio is currently comprised of five sGC stimulators:
 •olinciguat, currently in a Phase 2 trial as an oral, once-daily vascular sGC stimulator for patients suffering from sickle cell disease;
 •praliciguat, in two distinct Phase 2 trials as an oral, once daily systemic sGC stimulator for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, and for diabetic nephropathy, respectively;
 •IW 6463, a central nervous system penetrant oral sGC stimulator in clinical development for serious neurodegenerative diseases; and
 •two organ targeted programs to address serious diseases of the liver and lung, respectively.
 Collaborations and Partnerships
 As part of our strategy, we have established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to leverage as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and commercialization of our products in the U.S., either independently or with partners that have strong capabilities. We also intend to establish strong global brands by out‑licensing development and commercialization rights to our products in other key territories to high‑performing partners. We believe in the long‑term value of our drug candidates, so we seek collaborations that increase the value of our programs by providing meaningful economics and incentives for us and any potential partner. Furthermore, we seek partners who share our values, culture, processes and vision for our products, which we believe will enable us to work with those partners successfully for the entire potential patent life of our drugs. We intend to continue to expand our expertise in GI by accessing innovative externally developed products through strategic transactions and to leverage our existing capabilities to develop and commercialize these products in the U.S.

 The following chart shows our revenue for the U.S. and territories outside of the U.S. as a percentage of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
U.S. | 79.0 | % | 89.0 | % | 83.1 | %
Japan | 20.1 | % | 10.0 | % | 16.2 | %
Rest of world | 0.9 | % | 1.0 | % | 0.7 | %
 | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

      Revenue attributable to our linaclotide partnerships comprised substantially all of our revenue for each of the years indicated. Further, we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with Allergan for the U.S. and believe that the revenues from this collaboration will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue and sale of API outside of the U.S. has fluctuated for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, and may continue to fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of sales of linaclotide API to certain of our partners, license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships outside of the U.S., as well as the timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the markets in which it is currently approved, or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval.
 Linaclotide
 We have pursued a partnering strategy for commercializing linaclotide that has enabled us to retain significant oversight over linaclotide’s development and commercialization worldwide, share the costs with collaborators whose capabilities complement ours, and retain a significant portion of linaclotide’s future long‑term value. As of December 31, 2018, licensing fees, milestones, royalties and related equity investments from our linaclotide partners cumulatively totaled approximately $415.6 million. In addition, we and Allergan jointly fund the development and commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S., sharing equally in any net profits or losses, and we and AstraZeneca jointly fund the development and commercialization of linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca receiving 55% of the net profits or incurring 55% of the net losses until a certain specified commercial milestone is achieved, at which time profits or losses will be shared equally thereafter. Such reimbursements for our development and commercialization costs received from Allergan in the U.S. or AstraZeneca in China, Hong Kong, and Macau are excluded from the amount above.  Collaboration Agreement for North America with Allergan
 In September 2007, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Allergan to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS‑C, CIC and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we and Allergan are jointly and equally funding the development and commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S., with equal share of any profits or losses. Additionally, we granted Allergan exclusive rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Canada and Mexico for which we receive royalties in the mid-teens percent on net sales in those countries. Allergan is solely responsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in those countries and funding any costs. Total licensing, milestone payments, and related equity investments under the Allergan collaboration agreement for North America could total up to $330.0 million, including the $205.0 million that Allergan has already paid to us in license fees and all six development‑related milestones and the $25.0 million of our capital stock that Allergan has already purchased.
 License Agreement with Allergan (All countries other than the countries and territories of North America, China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Japan)
 In April 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall, or the European License Agreement, to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe (including the Commonwealth of Independent States and Turkey) for the treatment of IBS‑C, CIC and other GI conditions. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to Allergan. Additionally, in October 2015, we and Allergan separately entered into an amendment to the European License Agreement relating to the development and commercialization of linaclotide in Europe. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, (i) certain sales‑based milestones payable to us under the 

 
  9

 
European License Agreement were such that, when aggregated with the remaining commercial launch milestones, they could total up to $42.5 million, (ii) the royalties payable to us during the term of the European License Agreement were modified such that the royalties based on sales volume in Europe begin in the mid‑single digit percent and escalate to the upper‑teens percent by calendar year 2019, and (iii) Allergan assumed responsibility for the manufacturing of linaclotide API for Europe from us, as well as the associated costs. 
 In January 2017, we and Allergan entered into an amendment to the European License Agreement. The European License Agreement, as amended, extended the license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, and the countries and territories of North America.  On a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in such additional territory, Allergan is obligated to pay us a royalty as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an active ingredient in the upper-single digits for five years following the first commercial sale of a linaclotide product in a country, and in the low-double digits thereafter.  The royalty rate for products in the expanded territory will decrease, on a country-by-country basis, to the lower-single digits, or cease entirely, following the occurrence of certain events. Allergan is also obligated to assume certain purchase commitments for quantities of linaclotide API under our agreements with third-party API suppliers. The amendment to the European License Agreement did not modify any of the milestones or royalty terms related to Europe.
 License Agreement for Japan with Astellas
 In November 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas, as amended, to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS‑C, CIC and other GI conditions in Japan. Astellas is responsible for development, regulatory approval and commercialization in Japan, as well as funding the associated costs. Astellas has paid us all licensing and milestone payments under the license agreement totaling $75.0 million. These payments consisted of a $30.0 million up‑front licensing fee and $45.0 million in development milestones. Astellas is obligated to pay us gross royalties which escalate based on sales volume in the Astellas territory, beginning in the low‑twenties percent, less the transfer price paid by Astellas to us for the API included in the product actually sold in Japan and other contractual deductions.
 Collaboration Agreement for China, Hong Kong and Macau with AstraZeneca
 In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co‑develop and co‑commercialize linaclotide in China, Hong Kong and Macau. In January 2019, the National Medical Products Administration approved the marketing application for LINZESS for adults with IBS-C in China. Under the terms of the agreement, we and AstraZeneca are jointly funding the development and commercialization of linaclotide in the AstraZeneca territory, with AstraZeneca receiving 55% of the net profits or incurring 55% of the net losses until a certain specified commercial milestone is achieved, at which time profits or losses will be shared equally thereafter. If linaclotide is successfully developed and commercialized in the AstraZeneca territory, total licensing and milestone payments to us under the collaboration agreement could total up to $150.0 million, including the $25.0 million that AstraZeneca has already paid to us. 
 Co-Promotion and Other Commercial Agreements

Commercial Agreement with Allergan
 In January 2017, we and Allergan entered into a commercial agreement under which the adjustments to our or Allergan’s share of the net profits under the share adjustment provision of the collaboration agreement for linaclotide in North America relating to the contractually required calls on physicians in each year are eliminated, in full, in 2018 and all subsequent years. Pursuant to the commercial agreement, Allergan also appointed us, on a non-exclusive basis, to promote CANASA®, approved for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis, and DELZICOL®, approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, in the U.S. for approximately two years. The share adjustment relief will, in the case of Allergan’s termination for convenience and certain other specified circumstances, survive termination of the commercial agreement.
 In August 2015, we and Allergan entered into a non-exclusive agreement for the co-promotion of VIBERZI® (eluxadoline) in the U.S., Allergan’s treatment for adults suffering from IBS-D or the VIBERZI Co-Promotion Agreement, which expired in December 2017. Under the terms of the VIBERZI Co-Promotion Agreement, our clinical sales specialists detailed VIBERZI to the same health care practitioners to whom they detailed LINZESS. Allergan was responsible for all costs and activities relating to the commercialization of VIBERZI outside of the co-promotion. 

 
  10

 

 In December 2017, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to continue to promote VIBERZI through December 31, 2018 and to discontinue promoting DELZICOL effective January 1, 2018. We perform certain third position details and offer samples of CANASA to gastroenterology prescribers who are on the then-current call panel for LINZESS to which we provide first or second position details, and we purchase samples of CANASA from Allergan at the actual manufacturing cost.  Allergan is obligated to pay us a royalty in the mid-teens on incremental sales of CANASA above a mutually agreed upon sales baseline.  We commenced the promotion activities for CANASA on February 27, 2017. In addition, our clinical sales specialists detail VIBERZI to the same health care practitioners to whom they detail LINZESS. We have the potential to achieve milestone payments of up to $7.5 million based on the net sales of VIBERZI, provided we perform a minimum number of VIBERZI calls on physicians, and will also be compensated via reimbursements for medical education initiatives. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to discontinue our promotion of CANASA effective December 31, 2018, and to extend our promotion of VIBERZI through March 31, 2019, subject to our or Allergan’s rights of early termination.

  Competition
 Linaclotide 
 Linaclotide competes globally with certain prescription therapies and over‑the‑counter, or OTC, products for the treatment of IBS‑C and CIC, or their associated symptoms.

OTC and generic laxatives make up the majority of the IBS-C and CIC treatment market, according to the Lieberman GI Patient Landscape Survey performed in 2010 and the 2018 U.S. Census. Polyethylene glycol (such as MiraLAX®) and lactulose account for the majority of prescription laxative treatments, according to 2015 data from IQVIA Inc. National Prescription Audit. Given the low barriers to access, many IBS-C and CIC sufferers try OTC fiber and laxatives, but according to this same patient landscape survey, less than half of them are very satisfied with the 

 
  11

 
ability of these OTC products to manage their symptoms. Two of the highest selling OTC laxatives in the U.S., based on 2017 U.S. sales volume data from IQVIA Inc. National Prescription Audit, are MiraLAX (PEG 3350) and Dulcolax®. In November 2018, the FDA withdrew approval for certain prescription products containing MiraLAX for occasional constipation. This change had no effect on OTC products containing MiraLAX for occasional constipation.
 Until the launch of LINZESS, the only available branded prescription therapy for IBS‑C and CIC in the U.S. was AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), which was approved for the treatment of CIC in 2006, for the treatment of IBS‑C in 2008, and for the treatment of opioid‑induced constipation in 2013. AMITIZA is being commercialized in the U.S. by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Limited. Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Synergy, obtained approval of TRULANCE® (plecanatide) in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in January 2017 and for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in January 2018. In December 2018, Bausch Health Companies agreed to acquire substantially all of Synergy’s assets, including all rights to TRULACE, dolcanatide and all related intellectual property in the context of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. The sale is subject to a competitive process and the Company’s receipt of higher and better offers. Shire plc obtained approval of Motegrity™ (prucalopride) in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in December 2018. AMITIZA is being commercialized for the treatment of adults with CIC in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland by Sucampo AG, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan by Mylan N.V. 
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We currently manage our global supply and distribution of linaclotide through a combination of contract manufacturers and collaboration partners. It is our objective to produce safe and effective medicine on a worldwide basis, with redundancy built into critical steps of the supply chain. We believe that we have sufficient in‑house expertise to manage our manufacturing and supply chain network to meet worldwide demand.
 Linaclotide production consists of three phases—manufacture of the API (sometimes referred to as drug substance), manufacture of drug product and manufacture of finished goods. We and certain of our partners have entered into commercial supply agreements with multiple third-party manufacturers for the production of linaclotide API. We believe our commercial suppliers have the capabilities to produce linaclotide API in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, on a sufficient scale to meet our development and commercial needs. Our commercial suppliers are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies worldwide and also undergo periodic audit and certification by our quality department. 
 Each of Allergan and Astellas is responsible for drug product and finished goods manufacturing for its respective territories, and distribution of finished goods to their customers. We have an agreement with an independent third party to serve as a source of drug product manufacturing of linaclotide for our partnered territories and we have worked with our partners to achieve sufficient redundancy in this component of the linaclotide supply chain. Under our collaboration with AstraZeneca, we are accountable for drug product and finished goods manufacturing for China, for drug product manufacturing for Hong Kong and Macau, with AstraZeneca accountable for finished goods manufacturing for Hong Kong and Macau.
 Prior to linaclotide, there was no precedent for long‑term room temperature shelf storage formulation for an orally dosed peptide to be produced in millions of capsules per year. Our efforts to date have led to a formulation that is both cost effective and able to meet the stability requirements for commercial pharmaceutical products. Our work in this area has created an opportunity to seek additional intellectual property protection around the linaclotide program. In conjunction with Allergan and Astellas, we have filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have been issued multiple U.S. patents to protect the current commercial formulation of linaclotide as well as related formulations. These issued U.S. patents expire in the early 2030s. If issued, the pending patent applications would expire in 2029 or later in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and would be eligible for potential patent term adjustments or patent term extensions in countries where such extensions may be available.
 Sales and Marketing
 For the foreseeable future, we intend to develop and commercialize our drugs in the U.S. alone or with partners, and expect to rely on partners to commercialize our drugs in territories outside the U.S. In executing our strategy, our goal is to retain oversight over the worldwide development and commercialization of our products by playing an active role in their commercialization or finding partners who share our vision, values, culture and processes.

 
  12

 

 We built our commercial capabilities, including marketing, reimbursement, patient engagement and sales, with the intent to leverage these capabilities for future internally and externally developed products. To date, we have established a high‑quality commercial organization dedicated to bringing innovative, highly‑valued healthcare solutions to our customers, including patients, payers, and healthcare providers. 
 We are also coordinating efforts with our linaclotide partners to ensure that we launch and maintain an integrated, global linaclotide brand. By leveraging the knowledge base and expertise of our experienced commercial team and the insights of each of our linaclotide commercialization partners, we continually improve our collective marketing strategies.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing patents that cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; defend our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 Linaclotide Patent Portfolio
 Our linaclotide patent portfolio is currently composed of ten U.S. patents listed in the FDA publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations”, or the Orange Book, three granted European patents, all of which have been validated in each of 31 European countries, nine granted Japanese patents, five granted Chinese patents, 38 issued patents in other foreign jurisdictions, and numerous pending U.S., foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications. We own or jointly own all of the issued patents and pending applications.
 The issued U.S. patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2033, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, processes for making the molecule, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide and methods of use thereof. The granted European patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2027, some of which are subject to potential patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and uses of linaclotide to prepare medicaments for treating GI disorders. The granted Chinese patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2032, the granted Japanese patents, which will expire between 2024 and 2035, some of which are subject to potential patent term extension, and the granted patents in other foreign jurisdictions, which will expire between 2024 and 2032, some of which may be subject to potential patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions of linaclotide for use in treating GI disorders, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide.
 We have pending patent applications in certain countries worldwide that, if issued, will expire between 2024 and 2032 and which include claims covering the linaclotide molecule, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, the current commercial formulation of linaclotide and uses thereof to treat GI disorders.
 We have pending applications directed to linaclotide products, including MD-7246, that, if issued, will expire in 2037 or later. We also have pending U.S., foreign and PCT applications directed to linaclotide and related molecules, pharmaceutical formulations thereof, methods of using linaclotide to treat various diseases and disorders and processes for making the molecule. These additional patent applications, if issued, will expire between 2024 and 2037.
 The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA‑approved drug is also eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for some of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of a single patent applicable to an approved drug for up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but the extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval by the FDA. The United States Patent and Trademark 

 
  13

 
Office, or USPTO, has issued a Certificate of Patent Term Extension for U.S. Patent 7,304,036, which covers linaclotide and methods of use thereof. As a result, the patent term of this patent was extended to August 30, 2026, 14 years from the date of linaclotide’s approval by the FDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have received patent term extensions in Japan for several of our linaclotide patents. We have also received patent term extensions, called supplementary protection certificates, for certain linaclotide patents from several national patent offices in Europe.
 We and Allergan have received Notice Letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the FDA by generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of linaclotide capsule (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of LINZESS. In 2018, we and Allergan entered into settlement agreements with three generic drug manufacturers. For additional information relating to such ANDAs and any resolution of related litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 IW-3718
 Our pipeline patent portfolio relating to our IW-3718 development program is currently composed of one issued U.S. patent and eight issued patents in foreign jurisdictions; and numerous pending provisional, U.S. non-provisional, foreign and PCT patent applications. We own all of the issued patents and pending applications. The issued U.S. patent expires in 2031. The foreign issued patents expire in 2027. The pending patent applications, if issued, will expire between 2027 and 2038.
 Additional Intellectual Property
 In addition to the patents and patent applications related to linaclotide, and IW-3718, we currently have 11 issued U.S. patents; 27 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions, including European and Eurasian patents that have each been validated in several countries; and a number of pending U.S. foreign and PCT applications directed to other GC‑C agonist and sGC stimulator molecules and uses thereof. We also have other issued patents and pending patent applications relating to our other research and development programs.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non‑provisional application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier‑filed patent. We also expect to apply for patent term extensions for some of our patents once issued, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA.
 Cyclerion Intellectual Property  
 There are eight issued U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. patents applications, 10 pending PCT applications, and numerous foreign patents and pending patent applications covering the product candidates that Cyclerion expects to advance following completion of the planned separation of Ironwood and Cyclerion. The olinciguat patent portfolio in the U.S. includes three U.S. patents, four pending U.S. patent applications, three PCT applications and one provisional application. The praliciguat patent portfolio in the U.S. includes three U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, three PCT applications and one provisional application. The IW-6463 portfolio includes pending PCT, U.S. and foreign applications. The technology underlying the sGC patents and pending patent applications has been developed by us and was not acquired from any in-licensing agreement. We own all of the issued patents and pending applications.  Government Regulation
 Our business is subject to government regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, as well as similar foreign regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-marketing requirements and assessments, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA and other regulatory authorities have very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions 

 
  14

 
being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and civil or criminal prosecution.
 FDA Approval Process
 We believe that our product candidates will be regulated by the FDA as drugs. No company may market a new drug until it has submitted an NDA to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. The steps required before the FDA may approve an NDA generally include:
· | conducting nonclinical laboratory tests and animal tests in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current GMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | conducting adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific intended use(s);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in order to evaluate a drug in humans in the U.S., an investigational new drug application, or IND, must be submitted and come into effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current GMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | inspections of other sources of data in the NDA, such as inspection of clinical trial sites to assess compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements are also generally required; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

  Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. We must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials in the U.S. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trial. In such a case, we must work with the FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that will cause us or the FDA to modify, suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB requirements or if the trial has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. An IRB may also impose other conditions on the trial. For studies conducted outside of the U.S., similarly, we are subject to local regulations which may differ from the U.S. and local regulations must be followed appropriately.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and 

 
  15

 
pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:

· | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase III trials; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------

  Phase III trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with GCP regulations and guidance, and regulations designed to protect the rights and safety of subjects involved in investigations.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
 The results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The review process, however, may be extended by FDA requests for additional information, nonclinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless current GMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information. The FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post‑marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large‑scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidate supply. Failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees, including Allergan, Astellas and AstraZeneca, to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect commercialization and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
 Hatch‑Waxman Act
 The Hatch‑Waxman Act established abbreviated approval procedures for generic drugs. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA with the FDA. The application for a generic drug is “abbreviated” because it need not include nonclinical or clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and may instead rely on the FDA’s previous finding that the brand drug, or reference drug, is safe and effective. In order to obtain approval of an ANDA, an applicant must, among other things, establish that its product is bioequivalent to an existing approved drug and that it has the same active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, and the same route of administration. A generic drug is considered bioequivalent to its reference drug if testing demonstrates that the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the reference drug when administered under similar experimental conditions.

 
  16

 

 The Hatch‑Waxman Act also provides incentives by awarding, in certain circumstances, certain legal protections from generic competition. This protection comes in the form of a non‑patent exclusivity period, during which the FDA may not accept, or approve, an application for a generic drug, whether the application for such drug is submitted through an ANDA or a through another form of application, known as a 505(b)(2) application.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Act grants five years of exclusivity when a company develops and gains NDA approval of a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved by the FDA. This exclusivity provides that the FDA may not accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for five years after the date of approval of previously approved drug, or four years in the case of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that challenges a patent claiming the reference drug (see discussion below regarding Paragraph IV Certifications). The Hatch‑Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for approved applications for drugs that are not new chemical entities, if the application contains the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that were essential to approval of the application. Examples of such applications include applications for new indications, dosage forms (including new drug delivery systems), strengths, or conditions of use for an already approved product. This three‑year exclusivity period only protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications for generic drugs that include the innovation that required new clinical investigations that were essential to approval; it does not prohibit the FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic drugs that do not include such an innovation.
 Paragraph IV Certifications. Under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, NDA applicants and NDA holders must provide information about certain patents claiming their drugs for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a “Paragraph IV” certification.
 Within 20 days of the acceptance by the FDA of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must notify the NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent holder may then initiate a patent infringement suit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a 30‑month stay of the FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30‑month stay only if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, and the court may shorten or lengthen the 30-month stay under certain limited circumstances.
 Patent Term Restoration. Under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA or 505(b)(2) application is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of the IND and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of patent term extension is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 After approval, drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with current GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA‑imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.

 
  17

 

 We and any manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current GMP regulations. Current GMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet current GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre‑approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third‑party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 With respect to post‑market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting drugs for uses, conditions or diseases, or in patient populations that are not consistent with the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”), and principles governing industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or patients, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off‑label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off‑label uses.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar in type and quality to the clinical data supporting the original application for the original indication, and the FDA uses similar procedures and actions in reviewing such NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or to place conditions on an approval that restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 Outside the U.S., our and our collaborators’ abilities to market a product are contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the E.U. registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one E.U. member state. We are subject to U.S. federal and foreign anti-corruption laws. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA encompasses certain healthcare professionals in many countries. We are also subject to similar laws of other countries that have enacted anti-corruption laws and regulations.
 Pricing and Reimbursement
 Within the U.S., significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or to restrict coverage of our products could reduce utilization of our products. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 

 
  18

 

 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort.  Federal and state governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of new or enhanced cost-containment measures could limit our net revenue and results.  Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  Restrictions in coverage or decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the increasing influence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs or reduce reimbursement for drugs, and public scrutiny of drug pricing.  While we cannot predict what executive, legislative and regulatory proposals will be adopted or other actions will occur, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.  For additional information relating to pricing and reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Sales and Marketing
     The marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S. 
     Within the U.S., numerous federal, state and local authorities have jurisdiction over, or enforce laws related to, such activities, including the FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, state departments of health and state pharmacy boards.
     We are subject to the requirements of the FDC Act and accompanying regulations that prohibit pharmaceutical companies from promoting a drug prior to approval from the FDA and from promoting an approved drug in a manner inconsistent with the approved label.
     We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our products or product candidates that may in the future receive marketing approval.  Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.  Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices.  False claims laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent.  Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). 
     Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products.  The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.
     Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 515 employees. Approximately 26 were scientists engaged in discovery research, 173 were in our drug development organization, 214 were in our sales and commercial team, and 102 were in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we commenced certain reductions in our workforce. In February 2019, following further analysis of our strategy and core business needs, and in an effort to further strengthen the operational efficiency of its organization, we commenced a reduction in our workforce by 35 employees, primarily based
