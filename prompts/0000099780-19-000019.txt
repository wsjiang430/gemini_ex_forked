Item 1. Business.
General
Trinity Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Trinity,” “Company,” “we,” or “our”) own businesses that are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America. Our rail-related businesses market their railcar products and services under the trade name TrinityRail®. The TrinityRail integrated business platform provides railcar leasing and management services, railcar manufacturing, and railcar maintenance and modification services. We also own businesses engaged in the manufacturing of products used on the nation's roadways and in traffic control, as well as a transportation business that provides support services to Trinity and a variety of other industrial manufacturers. 
Trinity was incorporated in 1933 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. We are headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and our principal executive offices are located at 2525 N. Stemmons Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75207-2401. Our telephone number is 214-631-4420, and our Internet website address is www.trin.net.
Unless otherwise stated, any reference to income statement items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Form 10-K") refers to results from continuing operations.
Spin-off of Arcosa, Inc.
On November 1, 2018, we completed the separation of Trinity Industries, Inc. into two public companies: (1) Trinity Industries, Inc., comprised of Trinity’s rail-related businesses, which are leading providers of rail transportation products and services in North America, and (2) Arcosa, Inc. ("Arcosa"), a new public company focused on infrastructure-related products and services. The separation was effected through a pro rata dividend to Trinity's shareholders of all outstanding Arcosa shares and was structured to qualify as a tax free distribution for federal income tax purposes. Following the distribution, Arcosa became an independent, publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. Trinity did not retain an ownership interest in Arcosa following the completion of the spin-off transaction. 
In connection with the Arcosa spin-off, Rhys J. Best, David W. Biegler, Antonio Carrillo, Ronald J. Gafford, and Douglas L. Rock resigned from their positions as members of Trinity's Board of Directors, effective as of November 1, 2018. Each of Messrs. Best, Biegler, Carrillo, Gafford, and Rock is now a director of Arcosa.  Additionally, in connection with the Arcosa spin-off, each of Brandon B. Boze, John J. Diez, and E. Jean Savage was appointed as a director of Trinity’s Board of Directors, effective as of November 1, 2018. 
Upon completion of the spin-off transaction on November 1, 2018, the accounting requirements for reporting Arcosa as a discontinued operation were met. Accordingly, Arcosa's results of operations are presented as discontinued operations for all periods in this Form 10-K. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the spin-off transaction.
Our Reportable Segments
Following the completion of the Arcosa spin-off, we have three reportable segments: the Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group ("Leasing Group"), the Rail Products Group, and All Other. Our All Other segment includes the results of our highway products business, which was previously reported within our former Construction Products Group. Additionally, our Rail Products Group includes the results of our heads business, which was previously reported in our former Energy Equipment Group. Further, our axles, couplers, and industrial and mining components businesses, previously reported in the Rail Products Group, were transferred to Arcosa in connection with the spin-off transaction and are therefore reflected as a component of discontinued operations. All segment results set forth herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis.
Business Overview and Current Business Strategy
We believe that we are a premier provider of railcar related products and services. We strive to operate industry-leading integrated railcar leasing, manufacturing, and services businesses, by providing a single source for comprehensive rail transportation solutions and services in North America. Our objective is to deliver a premier customer experience by providing high quality, innovative products and designing solutions that enhance and optimize our customers' businesses. As we continue to concentrate our focus and resources, we see opportunities to grow and enhance our product and service offerings in ways that will optimize the ownership and use of railcars. 
Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group is a leading provider in North America of comprehensive railcar industry services. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, primarily Trinity Industries Leasing Company ("TILC"), and partially-owned subsidiaries, TRIP Rail Holdings LLC (“TRIP Holdings”) and RIV 2013 Rail Holdings LLC ("RIV 2013"), we offer operating leases for freight and tank railcars. Trinity's Rail Products Group and TILC coordinate sales and marketing activities under the registered trade name TrinityRail, thereby providing a single point of contact for railroads and shippers seeking rail equipment and services.

In addition, TILC originates and manages railcar leases for third-party investor-owned funds and provides fleet maintenance and management services to industrial shippers. Our affiliations with third-party investor-owned funds, through strategic railcar alliances and the formation of railcar investment vehicles, combined with TILC's fleet maintenance and management services capabilities, complement our leasing business by generating stable fee income, strengthening customer relationships, and enhancing the view of TrinityRail® as a leading provider of railcar products and services. 
The railcars in our lease fleet are leased to industrial shippers and railroads. These companies operate in various markets including agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and chemicals. Substantially all of the railcars in our lease fleet were manufactured by our Rail Products Group. The terms of our railcar leases generally vary from one to twenty years and provide for fixed monthly rentals, predominantly under full-service leases. A small percentage of our fleet is leased on a per diem basis. As of December 31, 2018, the lease fleet of our subsidiaries included 99,215 owned or leased railcars that were 98.5% utilized, of which 89,870 railcars were owned by TILC or its affiliates and 9,345 railcars were financed in sale-leaseback transactions, which are not reflected in the property, plant, and equipment amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Railcars under management, including those owned by third-parties, totaled 120,850 railcars.
The following charts provide additional information with respect to the Company's wholly-owned, partially-owned, and managed leased fleet.

Rail Products Group. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries with manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Mexico, our Rail Products Group is a leading manufacturer of freight and tank railcars in North America used for transporting a wide variety of liquids, gases, and dry cargo.
The Rail Products Group offers a complete portfolio of railcar solutions to our customers. We manufacture a full line of railcars, including:
Autorack Cars - Autoracks and flatcars transport finished automobiles, sport utility vehicles, and light trucks.
Box Cars - Box cars carry a wide variety of bulk cargo such as auto parts, paper, and food products.
Covered Hopper Cars - Covered hopper cars transport commodities such as industrial sand and cement, grain products, dry fertilizer, and plastics. Pressure differential covered hopper cars carry products such as flour and starch.
Gondola Cars - Rotary gondola cars are primarily used for coal service. Other gondola cars carry bulk commodities such as scrap metal, aggregates, ores, and finished steel.
Intermodal Cars - Intermodal cars transport shipping containers in single or double stacked configurations as well as truck trailers.
Open Hopper Cars - Open hopper cars are used to transport coal, aggregates, and other similar products.
Tank Cars - Non-pressurized tank cars transport a wide variety of liquid commodities including chemicals, food products, and petroleum products. Pressurized tank cars are used to transport liquefied gases.
We believe that our Rail Products Group's diversified manufacturing capabilities enable us to capitalize on changing industry trends and developing opportunities in various markets including agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and chemicals. 
We offer a full range of maintenance services and flexible solutions, from field inspections and comprehensive compliance testing to standard repairs and maintenance, specialized cleaning, inspection, and testing at multiple facilities in the U.S. We also provide modification capabilities and assist in transitioning railcars to new industry standards. We believe that our investment in maintenance services expands and enhances our ability to serve our customers and our lease fleet.
Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, and industrial shippers of products in various markets, such as agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and chemicals. We compete in the North American market primarily against five major railcar manufacturers and numerous other maintenance services providers.
We hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcars and components. We believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances. No material revenues are received from the licensing of these patents.
All Other. All Other includes our highway products business; our transportation company and captive insurance company; legal, environmental, and maintenance costs associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses.
Our highway products business is a leading U.S. manufacturer of guardrail, crash cushions, and other highway barriers. The Federal Highway Administration ("FHWA"), which determines product eligibility for cost reimbursement using federal funds, has approved many of our products as eligible for federal-aid reimbursement based on satisfactory performance testing pursuant to criteria established under either the National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 350 or the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware, as applicable. Our crash cushion, barrier, and guardrail product lines include multiple proprietary products manufactured under license from certain public and private research organizations and inventors as well as Company-held patents. We sell highway products throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and we export highway products, including proprietary products, internationally. We do not perform any installation services with respect to our highway products. Our highway products business is affected by seasonal fluctuations, with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.

Backlog. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our backlog of firm orders was as follows:

 | December 31,2018 | | December 31,2017
 | (in millions) 
Rail Products Group | | | 
Products: | | | 
External Customers | $ | 2,059.5 | | | $ | 1,334.7
Leasing Group | 1,588.1 | | | 829.5 | 
 | $ | 3,647.6 | | | $ | 2,164.2
Maintenance Services | $ | 100.6 | | | $ | 74.4 
Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group | $ | 112.6 | | | $ | 123.5 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our rail manufacturing businesses received orders for 28,795 railcars. The change in backlog as of December 31, 2018 compared with our backlog as of December 31, 2017 reflects the value of orders taken, net of cancellations, executory contract change orders and price modifications, and orders delivered during the year. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount of backlog attributable to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may choose to purchase railcars from the Rail Products Group rather than lease. Approximately 64% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019 with the remainder to be delivered thereafter into 2023. 
Marketing. We sell or lease substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple U.S locations as well as Canada and Mexico. We also use independent sales representatives on a limited basis.
Raw Materials and Suppliers.
Railcar Specialty Components and Steel. Products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials, such as steel, as well as numerous specialty components, such as brakes, wheels, heads, side frames, bolsters, and bearings. The input costs for raw steel and specialty components purchased from third parties represent a substantial portion of the cost of most railcars. Although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years, at least two suppliers continue to produce most components.
The principal material used in railcar manufacturing is steel. During 2018, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and were lower exiting 2018 compared to 2017. Steel and component prices may be volatile in the future as a result of market conditions, changes in tariffs, or other governmental policies. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profits for the year. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts. 
Employees. The following table presents the approximate headcount breakdown of employees by business group:
Business Group | December 31,2018
Rail Products Group | 9,810 
Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group | 230 
All Other | 1,120 
Corporate | 355 
 | 11,515 

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,150 employees were employed in the U.S. and 6,365 in Mexico.

Environmental Matters. We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and materials; and other activities relating to the protection of human health, natural resources, and the environment. 
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We believe that our operations and facilities, whether owned, managed, or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non-compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.
Governmental Regulation.
Railcar Industry. Our railcar and related manufacturing, maintenance services, and leasing businesses are regulated by multiple governmental regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA"); Transport Canada ("TC"); the U.S. Department of Transportation ("USDOT") and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA"), the Research and Special Programs Administration; and industry authorities such as the Association of American Railroads ("AAR"). All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications, and operating standards affecting railcar design, configuration, and mechanics; maintenance, and rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment, tracks, and operations, including the packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials. We believe that our product designs and operations are in compliance with these specifications, standards, and regulations applicable to our business.
Revised regulations pertaining to the transportation of flammable materials by rail remain in effect. These regulatory changes materially impact: the rail industry as a whole; railroad operations; older and newer tank railcars that met or exceeded prior regulatory requirements and standards; tank railcar specifications; and market decisions relative to capital investment in rail products. 
Highway Products. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of highway products manufacturers are the USDOT, the FHWA, and various state highway departments and administrative agencies. These organizations, with participation from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ("AASHTO"), establish certain specifications, product testing criteria, and performance standards related to the manufacture of our highway products. We believe that our highway products are in compliance with the standards and specifications applicable to our business. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. Our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social ("STPS") in Mexico. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims that may be asserted against us for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
See Item 1A for further discussion of risk factors with regard to environmental, governmental, and other matters.
