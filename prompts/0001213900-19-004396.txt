The Company owns 99.3% of its subsidiary, Genie Energy International Corporation ("GEIC"), which owns 100% of Genie Retail Energy ("GRE"), 100% of Genie Energy Services ("GES"), 60% of Prism Solar Technology, Inc. ("Prism") and 97% of Genie Oil and Gas, Inc. ("GOGAS"). 

GRE, owns and operates retail energy providers, ("REPs"), including IDT Energy, Inc. ("IDT Energy"), Residents Energy, LLC ("Residents Energy"), Town Square Energy ("TSE"), Southern Federal Power ("SFP") and Mirabito Natural Gas, ("Mirabito"). Its REP businesses resell electricity and natural gas to residential and business customers primarily in the Eastern United States. Internationally, GRE manages our interest in a joint venture that serves retail customers in the United Kingdom ("U. K.") and our business in Japan recently launched commercial operations. In January 2019, we acquired an 80% controlling interest in Lumo Energia Ojy ("Lumo"), a REP with approximately 32,000 residential customers in Finland. 

GES oversees Diversegy LLC ("Diversegy"), a retail energy advisory and brokerage company that serves commercial and industrial customers throughout the U.S. and manages our 60%  controlling interest in Prism, a solar solutions company that is engaged in U.S. based manufacturing of solar panels, solar installation design and project management.

GOGAS is an oil and gas exploration company that owns an interest in a contracted drilling services operation and an 86.1% interest in Afek Oil and Gas, Ltd. (“Afek”), an oil and gas exploration project in the Golan Heights in Northern Israel. GOGAS also holds controlling interests in inactive oil and gas projects. Until September 2018, GOGAS owned Atid Drilling Ltd., a drilling services company operating in Israel. In September 2018, the Company divested a majority interest in Atid in exchange for a 37.5% interest in a newly formed contracted drilling services company in Israel.

As of December 31, 2018, Genie Retail Energy International, LLC ("GREI"), a subsidiary of GRE which holds the Company's ventures in the U. K., Japan and Finland, and GRES have outstanding deferred stock units granted to officers, employees and a contractor that represent an aggregate interest of 4.0% and 4.5% of the equity of GREI and GRES, respectively. The deferred stock units are subject to vesting until 2020.
 
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we revised our reportable segments in connection with the acquisition of Prism and reduced exploration activities. Specifically, we separated Genie Energy Services (“GES”) from GRE into a separate reportable segment which includes Prism. We also integrated GOGAS and Afek into one reportable segment. 

We have three reportable business segments: GRE, GES, and GOGAS. Our reportable segments are distinguished by types of service, customers and methods used to provide their services. Financial information by segment and geographic areas is presented in “Note 18 — Business Segment Information” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

BUSINESS

Genie Retail Energy
 
Genie Retail Energy is comprised of REPs and related businesses. GRE’s REP businesses purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their residential and business customers. The positive difference between the net sales price of electricity and natural gas sold to its customers and the cost of their electricity and natural gas supplies and related costs are the REP businesses’ gross profits.
 
GRE’s U.S. REP businesses operate in certain utility territories within the deregulated retail energy markets of thirteen states in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S.: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Rhode Island, as well as in Washington, D.C. A GRE subsidiary has recently become licensed in Texas. Internationally, GRE is serving customers in the United Kingdom through a joint venture and in Japan. In January 2019, GRE begun serving customers in Finland through acquisition of majority interest in Lumo.
 
GRE’s U.S. REP businesses operate under several brand names including IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy, Southern Federal Power and Mirabito. Internationally, GRE REPs operate under Orbit Energy in the U. K., Genie Japan in Japan and Lumo in Finland. Their diverse offerings, in both the electricity and natural gas markets include, variable rate offerings, fixed rate offerings, and green renewable offerings.
 
As part of our ongoing business development efforts, we seek out new opportunities in domestic and international jurisdictions, however, there are no assurances we will be successful in launching any such operations.
 
Historically, GRE’s REP businesses have expanded organically – adding new customers through customer acquisition programs at a rate faster than customers lost through attrition or churn – as well as through acquisitions of other REPs and books of business. New customers are generally acquired through a combination of marketing and sales channels including door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, online and digital marketing, direct mail, and by competitive bidding for exclusive contracts awarded by certain municipalities that, when authorized by state laws, award participating residents’ electricity supply to a single supplier.
 
Customer churn is a significant factor in the REP business, with monthly churn rates for GRE’s REPs averaging between four and eight percent per month. Customer churn tends to decrease when commodity prices fall, when weather-driven consumption decreases, when the price to REP customers decreases relative to competitors including the incumbent utility provider, or when the REPs incentivize customer tenure. Customer churn tends to increase when commodity prices rise, when weather driven consumption increases or spikes, or when the price to REP customers increases relative to the prices charged by competitors including incumbent utility providers. Newly acquired customers have higher rates of churn than longer-term customers.

On July 17, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with Energy Global Investments Pty Ltd (“EGC”) to launch a joint venture to offer electricity and natural gas service to residential and small business customers in the United Kingdom under the Orbit Energy brand. In September and December 2018, the Company contributed a total of  $1.3 million to the venture, which increased GEUK's total contribution to $5.3 million. In connection with the revised contributions and obligations,  GEUK’s ownership of the venture increased from 65% to 67%.

On August 10, 2017, GRE acquired Mirabito Natural Gas, a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida-based natural gas supplier, from Angus Partners, LLC (“Angus”). Mirabito serves commercial and government customers throughout Florida.

On June 7, 2018, Company subsidiary Genie Japan, LLC (“Genie Japan”), acquired Smile Energy G.K., (“Smile Energy”). Smile Energy is a Japanese company licensed to provide electricity to customers in Japan. The aggregate purchase price was $0.7 million. In addition, Capital Sixty received an option to purchase a 5% membership interest in Genie Japan at an exercise price of $1. The option is exercisable on the earlier of 18 months from the start of enrolling retail energy customers in Japan or June 7, 2020. At any time before exercise, Genie Japan may cancel the option in exchange for a payment of $0.3 million to Capital Sixty. In February 2019, the Company enrolled its first meters in the retail market under the brand name Genie Energy.
In January 2019, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Lumo, a Helsinki based provider of electricity to residential customers in Finland. At the time of the acquisition, Lumo was serving 32,000 customers.
 For the past two years, GRE’s REP businesses expanded to new markets both to accelerate growth of our customer base and to reduce operational and regulatory risk associated with heavy geographical concentration.
 
GRE’s revenue comprises 98% and 99% of our total consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, GRE generated revenue of $274.4 million comprised of $227.9 million from sales of electricity, $46.6 million from sales of natural gas, and a minimal amount of other revenue, as compared with revenue of $262.3 million in 2017, comprised of $222.2 million from the sales of electricity, $40.1 million from the sales of natural gas and a minimal amount of other revenue. Electricity sales have been a more significant portion of GRE’s business in recent years.
 
GRE’s REP operations are seasonal. Approximately 50% and 45% of our natural gas revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated during the first quarter, when the demand for heating peaks. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas, approximately 30% of total revenues from electricity sales in 2018 and 2017 were generated in the third quarter when the demand for cooling peaks.
 
Variations in weather can significantly impact GRE’s operations. For example, a polar vortex resulted in unusually sustained cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. This increased demand that was characterized by extraordinarily large spikes in the prices of wholesale electricity and natural gas in markets where GRE’s REPs and other retail providers purchase their supply.

As of December 31, 2018, GRE serviced 315,000 meters (245,000 electric and 70,000 natural gas), as compared to 412,000 meters (307,000 electric and 105,000 natural gas) as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in meters served was driven primarily by a strategic decision to reduce marketing efforts in certain territories.

REP Industry Overview
 
REPs operate in deregulated retail energy markets in the US and overseas. REPs purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell the commodities to their customers, who may include homeowners, renters and small to mid-sized commercial and governmental operations and institutions. Generally, incumbent local utilities continue to handle electricity and natural gas distribution, billing, and collections. The utilities remit the proceeds collected for the commodity supply portion of their bills less certain fees to the REPs.
 
REPs generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenues is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets and other factors. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and purchase of receivables, or POR, fees paid to the utilities, and program management.
 
As of December 31, 2018, there were thirty U.S. states in which there is some level of energy deregulation. We currently market in all the states where there is residential deregulation covering both electricity and natural gas. We are in the process of applying for licenses or setting up operations in additional states and are constantly evaluating entrance into new markets. Internationally, many of the most heavily populated countries in Western Europe, are deregulated. In addition, Japan and other Asian countries have recently deregulated residential energy markets as well.

 Competitors in the highly competitive REP market have engaged in unfair business practices to sign up new customers which creates an unfavorable impression about our industry on consumers, regulators or political bodies. Further, such practices can lead to regulatory action, such as the recent New York PSC Order and other regulatory proceedings and investigations the Company is subject to in several states, that can negatively impact us and the industry.

Customers; Marketing
 
United States

The services of GRE’s U.S. REPs - IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy, Southern Federal Power and Mirabito - are made available to customers under several offerings with distinct terms and conditions. The majority of our customer base is enrolled in variable rate programs via automatically renewing or month-to-month agreements, which enable us to recover our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas through adjustments to the rates charged to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments is determined by GRE, and is not restricted by regulation.
 
As of December 31, 2018, customers on variable rate products constituted 61% of our electric load, with the balance from customers on fixed rate agreements. For our variable rate product, the amount we charge to our customers reflects the underlying commodity cost plus a markup. 
 
Variable rate products are available to all customers in all states served by GRE’s REPs except for Connecticut. Likewise, Renewable (Green) energy supply options exist in all markets served by GRE’s REPs. Renewable (Green) Electricity supply is 100% matched with renewable energy certificates, or RECs, that reflect the generation of electricity from sources such as hydro-electric wind, solar and biomass.
 
The electricity and natural gas we sell through all of our offerings are metered and delivered to customers by the local utilities. The utilities also provide billing and collection services for the majority of our customers. For a small number of direct bill customers, we perform our own billing and collection. Additionally, GRE’s REPs’ receivables are, in many states, purchased by the utilities in whose areas we operate for a percentage of their face value (over the course of 2018, the associated cost was approximately 1.3% of GRE's revenue) in exchange for the utility receiving a first priority lien in the customer receivable without recourse against the REP. As a result, in these states, credit risk is mitigated. These are referred to as purchase of receivables, or POR, programs.

GRE’s REPs market their energy services primarily through direct marketing methods, including door-to-door sales, outbound telemarketing direct mail digital channel. As of December 31, 2018, GRE serviced 315,000 meters (245,000 electric and 70,000 natural gas), as compared to 412,000 meters (307,000 electric and 105,000 natural gas) as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in meters served was driven primarily by a strategic decision to reduce marketing efforts in certain territories.

GRE seeks to acquire profitable customers with a focus on low-risk markets, specifically where the utilities have adopted a portfolio of REP-friendly, regulatory-driven programs. Among these programs is POR programs. Under POR programs, utilities are contractually obligated to purchase customer receivables at pre-determined and fixed discounts. Utilities also offer consolidated billing as part of the POR program. Through consolidated billing, the utilities retain the responsibility for billing the individual customer and the subsequent collection of the remittances. There are markets in which we operate that the utilities engage in consolidated billing on behalf of REP’s but are not obligated to guarantee the receivables.
 
Certain utilities in Connecticut, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Maryland offer POR programs, without recourse, that permit customers with past-due balances to remain in the POR and consolidated bill programs. However, utilities in New Jersey generally do not permit customers with past-due balances beyond 120 days to enroll or remain in their POR programs, which means that after a certain amount of time (determined based on the specific commodity), the REP becomes responsible for the billing and collection of the commodity portion of the future invoices for its delinquent customers. Certain utilities in Delaware, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio and Rhode Island do not offer POR but they do offer consolidated billing. In Florida, there is no POR and we bill customers directly.
 
Additionally, GRE targets markets in which we can procure energy in an efficient and transparent manner. We seek to purchase wholesale energy where there is a real-time market that reflects a fair price for the commodity for all participants. This allows GRE to reflect a true market cost base and adjust its rates to its variable rate customers taking into account prevailing market rates.
 
We regularly monitor other deregulated or deregulating markets to determine if they are appropriate for entry, and may initiate the licensing process in a selected region to facilitate entry into the region contingent upon favorable deregulatory developments.

International
 
 The services of GRE’s international REPs – Orbit Energy, Genie Energy Japan and Lumo Energia, - are made available to customers under several offerings with distinct terms and conditions. In each country, there are varying rules and regulations regarding customer contracts and rate setting. Many of our international customers are on variable rate programs via automatically renewing or month-to-month agreements, which enable us to recover our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas through adjustments to the rates charged to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments is determined by GRE, and is not restricted by regulation. Additionally, many of our customers are on fixed rate contracts, which guarantees a rate per unit of energy to the customer for the duration of the agreed contract period.

The electricity and natural gas we sell through all of our offerings internationally are delivered to customers by the local utilities. In these jurisdictions we bill customers directly and are responsible for collection.

In 2018, GRE's international REPs did not contribute materially to GRE's revenues or gross profit.

Acquisition and Management of Gas and Electric Supply
 
Since 2009, certain of GRE’s U.S. REPs have been party to a Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company, or BP. The agreement allows for purchases of electricity and natural gas for customers focused in areas where the utilities have POR programs. Under the arrangement, those REPs purchase electricity and natural gas from BP at market rate plus a fee. The obligations to BP are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of the REPs’ customer’s receivables under the applicable POR program, and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with BP. The agreement with BP has been amended to cover the territories in which we operate. The agreement was modified and extended on June 7, 2018 to cover all domestic GRE REPs, and is scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2021. Our ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants.
 
GRE is required to meet certain minimum green energy supply criteria in some of the markets in which it operates. We meet those thresholds by acquiring renewable energy certificates, or REC’s. In addition, GRE offers green or other renewable energy products to its customers in all of the territories in which we operate. GRE acquires green renewable energy conversion rights or attributes and REC’s to satisfy the load requirements for these customers.
 
GRE does not own electrical power generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, or natural gas production, pipeline or distribution facilities. GRE’s REPs currently contract with Dominion Transmission, Inc., National Fuel Supply, Williams Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission and others for natural gas pipeline, storage and transportation services, and utilizes the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO, and PJM Interconnection, LLC, or PJM, for electric transmission and distribution. NYISO operates the high-voltage electric transmission network in New York State, and administers and monitors New York’s wholesale electricity markets. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of thirteen states (including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois) and the District of Columbia.
 
For risk management purposes, GRE’s REPs utilize forward physical delivery contracts for a portion of their purchases of electricity and natural gas, which are defined as commodity derivative contracts. In addition, GRE’s REPs enter into put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity and natural gas.
 
The ISOs perform real-time load balancing for each of the electrical power grids in which GRE REPs operate. Similarly, load balancing is performed by the utilities or local distribution company, or LDC, for each of the natural gas markets in which GRE operates. Load balancing ensures that the amount of electricity and natural gas that GRE’s REPs purchase is equal to the amount necessary to service its customers’ demands at any specific point in time. GRE’s REPs are charged or credited for balancing the electricity and natural gas purchased and sold for their account by their suppliers and the LDCs. GRE’s REPs manage the differences between the actual electricity and natural gas demands of their customers and their bulk or block purchases by buying and selling in the spot market, and through monthly cash settlements and/or adjustments to future deliveries in accordance with the load balancing performed by utilities, LDCs, and/or ISOs.

Internationally, GRE's REPs partner with local  providers of energy supply services. Hedging strategies are currently being developed as customer acquisition efforts ramp up.

Competition
 
United States

As an operator of REPs, GRE competes with the local utility companies in each of the markets in which it provides services and with many other licensed REPs. In some markets, competitor REPs are affiliated with local utilities. GRE also competes with several large vertically integrated energy companies as well as smaller independent operators. Competition with the utilities and REPs impacts GRE’s gross margins, customer acquisition rates and exposes GRE to customer churn.
 
REPs and utilities offering fixed rate products or guaranteed pricing often are unable to change their sell rates offered to customers in response to underlying commodity price volatility. In a downward moving commodity cost environment, variable rate REPs typically become more competitive as they benefit from the lag that utilities experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower commodity costs, and they may benefit from decreases in margin pressure, improvements in the customer acquisition environment, and lower rates of churn. In a rising commodity cost environment, REPs that offer variable rate products, and reflect real-time commodity costs, will typically become less competitive with fixed rate providers, experience increased margin pressure, a more challenging customer acquisition environment and higher rates of customer churn.
 
Increasing our market share depends in part on our ability to persuade more customers to switch from other providers to one of our REPs at a higher rate than our customers churn to other providers. Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GRE requires significant marketing and sales operations.

Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GREI requires significant marketing and sales operations. 
 
Regulation 
 
United States

REPs such as ours must be licensed in each state and utility service territory in which they operate. Each is subject to the rules and regulations governing the operations of REPs in each jurisdiction.
 
Although the rates charged by GRE’s REPs are not regulated in the same way as the rates of utility companies, the manner in which the REPs market to potential customers, and the relationships between the REPs and their customers, are heavily regulated. GRE’s REPs must also comply with various quarterly and/or annual reporting requirements in order to maintain their eligibility to provide service. In certain jurisdictions the REPs are required to publish product offers with the applicable regulatory commissions, or in the public domain, generally on a website established for such purpose. In addition to the regulations that govern the relationships between GRE’s REPs and their customers, GRE’s REPs also maintain specific Terms & Conditions or Terms of Service for each product in each jurisdiction that customers must agree to be bound by.
 
Due to dramatic increases in wholesale electricity costs that occurred during the “polar vortex” of the winter of 2014, the retail electricity prices that GRE’s REPs and many other variable rate electricity suppliers charged to their customers increased sharply. These retail electricity price increases resulted in large numbers of complaints, regulatory actions, and calls for legislation, regulation and litigation. GRE’s subsidiary, IDT Energy, paid approximately $5 million in rebates to affected customers in the year ended December 31, 2014. These events adversely affected GRE’s REPs customer churn, gross margins and results of operations.
 
As discussed more fully below in Item Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including those with utility commissions or other government regulatory or law enforcement agencies. 

As of December 31, 2018, GRE’s REPs operate in eight utility territories in New York, six utility territories in New Jersey, nine utility territories in Pennsylvania, four utility territories in Maryland, six utility territories in Ohio, five utility territories in Massachusetts, two utility territories in New Hampshire, two in Connecticut, one in Rhode Island, one in Washington, D.C. two in Illinois. The State of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey, the State of Maryland, the State of Illinois, the District of Columbia, the State of Ohio, the State of New Hampshire, the State of Rhode Island, the State of  Connecticut, the State of Florida, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of Delaware, the State of Maine, the federal government, and related public service/utility commissions, among others, establish the rules and regulations for our REP operations

Like all operators of REPs, GRE is affected by the actions of governmental agencies, mostly on the state level, by the respective state Public Service/Utility Commissions, and other organizations (such as NYISO and PJM) and indirectly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Regulations applicable to electricity and natural gas have undergone substantial change over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. We may be subject to new laws, orders or regulations or the revision or interpretation of existing laws, orders or regulations.
 New York Public Service Commission Orders

In December 2017, the New York Public Service Commission (“PSC”) held an evidentiary hearing to assess the retail energy market in New York. The parties recently completed post-hearing briefing in the proceedings. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of any new order from the PSC that may follow from the evidentiary process, while preparing various contingencies for operation in compliance with any new requirements that may be imposed. Depending on the final language of any new order, as well as the Company’s ability to modify its relationships with its New York customers, an order could have a substantial impact upon the operations of GRE’s REPs in New York. As of December 31, 2018, New York represented 32.4% of GRE’s total meters served and 24.8% of the total residential customer equivalents (“RCEs”) of GRE’s customer base. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, New York gross revenues were $74.2 million and $91.0 million, respectively.

An RCE represents a natural gas customer with annual consumption of 100 mmbtu or an electricity customer with annual consumption of 10 MWh. Because different customers have different rates of energy consumption, RCEs are an industry standard metric for evaluating the consumption profile of a given retail customer base.

On December 16, 2016, the PSC issued an order (the “2016 Order”) prohibiting REPs to service to customers enrolled in New York’s utility low-income assistance programs. Temporary stays of the 2016 Order expired, and REPs were required to return service of their low-income customers to the relevant local incumbent utility on the modified schedule set forth in the PSC’s 2016 Order. The 2016 Order required GRE’s REPs to transfer customer accounts comprising approximately 18,700 meters, representing approximately 10,600 RCEs, to their respective incumbent utilities in the three months ended March 31, 2018.

On March 27, 2018, the New York Court of Appeals granted Motions for Leave to Appeal the question of whether the New York Legislature ever imparted to the PSC the authority to regulate the rates that private, non-monopoly REPs charge their customers. The Court of Appeals is now set to review a 2017 decision entered by the Appellate Division, Third Department, concerning the issue of the scope of the PSC’s authority over REPs under the Public Service Law, and to pronounce New York law on that issue. The Court of Appeals has scheduled oral argument in the jurisdictional appeal for March 19, 2019.

International
 
REPs such as ours must be licensed in each country and utility service territory in which they operate. Each is subject to the rules and regulations governing the operations of REPs in each jurisdiction. These regulations dictate how we are we allowed to market to customers and how we price our product. For instance, in the UK, there are restrictions on how much we price our product above wholesale costs. In some jurisdictions, we can price our service without restriction as long as we notify the customers in writing in advance.
Employees 
 
As of March 1, 2019, GRE in the U.S. employed 149 full time employees, 69 of whom are located in the Jamestown, New York office, of which approximately 86% are affiliated with our customer care center, 36 of whom are located in our New Jersey office, 11 of whom are located in our Arizona office, 32 of whom are located in the Florida office performing customer acquisition and 1 is located in Texas with SFP.

 Internationally, we employed 10 full time employees located at our office in Tokyo, Japan. 

Genie Energy Services
 
GES is comprised of businesses that market and provide energy solutions. GES currently consists of  Diversegy and our controlling interest in Prism. 

Diversegy 

Diversegy is a commercial energy advisory firm helping clients to reduce costs, mitigate risk, and improve their bottom lines through the development and implementation of energy utilization and sourcing strategies. Diversegy works with customers to lower their energy supply costs, reduce their consumption with LED upfitting and other means, as well as provide on- and off-site generation with solar. Diversegy accounts for less than 1.0% of the Company’s revenue. Diversegy operates as an energy broker and advisor to industrial, commercial and municipal customers across deregulated energy markets in the United States. The Company markets its services though an in-house sales force as well as independent third-party brokers. The Company markets its services though an in-house sales force as well as independent third-party brokers. As of the end of 2018 the Company had 910 customers representing approximately 1,200,000,000 KwH in power and 25,000,000 therms of total deal volume under contract.
Prism Solar Technologies 
 
The Company acquired a 60% controlling interest in Prism in October 2018. Prism is a solar solutions company engaged in solar panel manufacturing, solar installation design and project management. In the U.S., Prism’s solar panels are used in residential, office and commercial buildings. Residential applications include solar sun rooms (solariums), skylights, canopies and sun decks. Prism's solar panels are used in the construction of parking canopies, electric vehicle car ports, parking structures, vertically mounted on buildings and many other custom applications.
 
Certain of Prism’s solar panels are designed with high efficiency N-type silicon solar cell technology designed into bifacial solar modules. This technology results in a reduction in the average cost per kilowatt hour. Elements of the technology Prism is protected under patent application. The glass-on-glass design of the solar panels increases the durability and lifetime value of the solar panels. Unlike traditional solar modules, where photo-voltaic (“PV”) cells can only use the sunlight that strikes the front of the module, Prism’s bifacial modules generate energy on both sides, capturing a substantial amount of light scattered from clouds and surrounding surfaces. In traditional modules this additional light is not converted into electricity.  Prism’s solutions are especially valuable when Prism's modules are mounted over highly reflective backgrounds, such as white roof, snow, sand, or other light-colored surfaces.
 
Solar Industry Overview
 
Products and services in this industry consist of silicon modules and cells, thin-film modules and cells and other modules cells. The demand for solar panel manufacturing is driven by government programs, commodity prices and international trade.

Solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the price of PV solar power systems, and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems, has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. The rapid price decline that PV solar energy has experienced in recent years has opened new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives. The fact that a PV solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets. Once installed, PV solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of energy generation. In addition to these economic benefits, solar energy has substantial environmental benefits. For example, PV solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas and other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation. Worldwide solar markets continue to develop, aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable. 

The solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. In particular, module average selling prices in the United States and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years, and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline globally to some degree in the future. In the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. Additionally, intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, EPC companies, and vertically-integrated solar companies such as Prism to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. In light of such market realities, we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module and system technologies, our manufacturing process, our vertically-integrated business model, our financial viability, and the sustainability of our modules and systems.

Multiple markets within the United States, exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market, including (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas; (ii) strong demand for renewable energy generation; and (iii) abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation. The market penetration of PV solar is also impacted by certain state and federal support programs, including the current 30% federal investment tax credit, as described under “Support Programs.” We have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing, engineering, constructing, and maintaining utility-scale power plants in the United States, particularly in California and other southwestern states, and increasingly in southeastern states. Currently, our solar projects in the United States account for a majority of the advanced stage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct.

Customers; Marketing

 The services of GES – Diversegy and Prism – are made available to customers via multiple channels and under several offerings.  The majority of our customer base consists of medium to large commercial customers who are looking to be more efficient with their energy consumption.  Our sales channels and marketing activities include a direct sales force, commission-only referral agents, telemarketing, digital marketing and radio advertising.
Diversegy is licensed as a broker in all deregulated markets throughout the United States. Most of our customers enroll in multi-year contracts that have a fixed rate with our partner suppliers. The supplier is fully responsible for risk management, billing and collections. Diversegy receives commissions from the supplier for the referral either as an upfront payment or as a residual over the life of the customers’ contract.

Sources of Material and Manufacturing

We have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products that meet our customers’ requirements at competitive costs. The Company employs a mix of outsourced manufacturing through high quality contract manufacturers and direct manufacturing capabilities in its Highland, New York facility. 
 We source our raw materials through a portfolio of component manufacturers and invest resources in continued cost-reduction effort. In all cases we seek a second and third source so as to limit dependence on any single suppliers.

 At Genie Solar Energy and Prism, customers have the choice of buying their solar systems either by paying for the system themselves or by financing it with third parties. GES is responsible for sales, manufacturing, project management of the installation, and collection of payment from the customers.
 As of December 31, 2018, customers on variable rate products constituted 61% of the electric load, with the balance from customers on fixed rate agreements. For our variable rate product, the amount we charge to our customers reflects the underlying commodity cost plus a markup.
Competition

The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market and reduced margins, which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to Canadian Solar Inc., Hanwha QCELLS Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., Kyocera Corporation, LG Corporation, Jinko Solar, NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Sharp Corporation, SunRun, Inc., Tesla, Inc., Trina Solar Ltd., Vivint, Inc., LONGi Solar, REC Group, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd. and First Solar, Inc.
 
We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.

In addition, universities, research institutions, and other companies have brought to market alternative technologies, such as thin-film solar technology, which compete with our PV technology in certain applications. Furthermore, the solar power market in general competes with other energy providers such as electricity produced from conventional fossil fuels supplied by utilities and other sources of renewable energy such as wind, hydro, biomass, solar thermal, and emerging distributed generation technologies such as micro-turbines, sterling engines and fuel cells.

Research and Development

Prism devotes substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems, adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems. Our development strategy is to identify features, products, and systems that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers. The Company measures the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost, efficiency, reliability, power output, and ease of use.
Regulation
 
Federal government support for renewable energy
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings (where applicable) of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating the U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) requiring current inclusion in the U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (v) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits may be realized; (vi) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), a new minimum tax; (vii) creating a new limitation on the deductible interest expense; and (viii) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
 
The U.S. federal government provides an uncapped investment tax credit, or “Federal ITC,” that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a residential or commercial solar generation facility. The Tax Act did not make any changes to the existing laws surrounding tax credits for renewable energy. The Federal ITC is currently scheduled to be reduced to 26% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2020 and to 22% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2021. A permanent 10% Federal ITC is available for non-residential solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2022.
 
U.S. state government support for renewable energy
 
Many states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for renewable energy facilities, which is additive to the Federal ITC. Further, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy facilities that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Certain of our renewable energy facilities in the U.S. have been financed with a tax equity financing structure, whereby the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the solar generation facility or wind power plant and receives the benefits of various tax credits.
 
Many state governments, utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a renewable energy facility for energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s renewable energy facility. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their renewable energy facility during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Some states also have established FIT programs that are a type of performance-based incentive where the system owner-producer is paid a set rate for the electricity their system generates over a set period of time.
 
There are 40 states that have a regulatory policy known as net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar generation facilities to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar generation facility in excess of electric load that is exported to the grid. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Some states require utilities to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds a set percentage of the utilities’ aggregate customer peak demand.
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. There are 29 states that have adopted a renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power generation facilities, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must procure and retire RECs. System owners often are able to sell RECs to utilities directly or in REC markets.
 
RPS programs and targets have been one of the key drivers of the expansion of solar and wind power and are expected to continue to contribute to solar and wind power installations in many areas of the United States. In addition to the 29 states with RPS programs, eight other states have non-binding goals supporting renewable energy.

Employees
 
As of March 1, 2019, GES employed 21 full time employees, 9 of whom are located in our New Jersey office and, 12 of whom are located in our Highland, New York facility working for Prism.
Genie Oil and Gas, Inc.
 
GOGAS is an oil and gas exploration company and owns an interest in a contracted drilling services operation. GOGAS holds an 86.1% interest in Afek Oild and Gas, Ltd. (“Afek”), an oil and gas exploration project in the Golan Heights in Northern Israel. GOGAS also holds controlling interests in inactive oil and gas project. Until September 2018, GOGAS owned Atid Drilling Ltd., a drilling services company operating in Israel. In September 2018, the Company divested a majority interest in Atid in exchange for a 37.5% interest in a newly formed drilling services company in Israel.
Afek Oil and Gas Ltd.
 
In April 2013, the Government of Israel finalized the award to Afek of an exclusive three-year petroleum exploration license covering 396.5 square kilometers in the southern portion of the Golan Heights. The license was subsequently extended to April 2018.
 
In February 2015, Afek began drilling its first exploratory well in Northern Israel’s Golan Heights. Afek completed drilling five wells in the Southern portion of its license area. In addition, Afek has undertaken well flow tests in multiple target zones within two of the completed wells. The results of the exploration program in this portion of the license area confirmed the presence of significant hydrocarbons in the basin, but the Afek concluded that the resource was likely not commercially viable given current and forecasted market conditions and other constraints, and that the greatest potential for commercial development lies in an area further north within the license area than any of the five completed exploratory wells.
 
In 2017, Afek turned its operational focus to the Northern region of its license area. The data analyzed suggested that the Southern block resources may extend Northward at depths potentially sufficient to have induced a greater level of maturation of the resource. To validate this hypothesis, in 2017, Afek drilled an exploratory well a site in the Northern portion of its license area. The company announced in November 2017 that the preliminary analysis of results from its completed Ness 10 exploratory well in Northern Israel suggests that the well’s target zone does not contain commercially producible quantities of oil or natural gas and that it was suspending drilling operations pending further analysis.
 
In light of the analysis received, Afek determined that, based on current information, it did not have a clear path to demonstrate probable or possible reserves in the license area over the next 12 to 18 months. Since there was substantial doubt regarding the economic viability of the well, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, Afek wrote off the $6.5 million of capitalized exploration costs incurred. At this time, no further exploration activity is contemplated. Subsequent analysis indicates that a zone within the well contains evidence of hydrocarbons at levels sufficient to warrant additional testing. Accordingly, Afek requested and received a renewal of its exploratory license from the Ministry of Energy for the Northern portion of its former license area. Afek is in the process of securing the permits and other regulatory approvals needed to perform the testing.
 
Drilling Services
 
In January 2017, we established Atid Drilling Ltd., ("Atid"), an on-shore drilling services venture based in Israel to opportunistically pursue drilling opportunities for clients in a variety of fields including oil and gas exploration, water resource development and mineral exploration. Atid purchased a drilling rig and associated drilling equipment in 2017. The rig had successfully drilled five exploratory oil and gas wells in the Golan Heights for Afek over the past two years and completed a water well. In September 2018, the Company divested a majority interest in Atid in exchange for a 37.5% interest in a newly formed drilling services company in Israel.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2019, GOGAS employed 3 employees. Afek also retains the services of a number of professional consultants, including geologists, hydrologists, drilling and completions engineers, process engineers, environmental experts, permitting consultants, energy experts, legal, and land designation and acquisition consultants.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain name registrations and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand names. All of our employees sign confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that the employee may not use or disclose our confidential information except as expressly permitted in connection with the performance of his or her duties for us, or in other limited circumstances.
