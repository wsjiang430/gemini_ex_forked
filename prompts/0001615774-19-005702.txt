The clothing has and will have basic bold colors, such as black, red, orange, yellow, green, grey, blue, purple, and fuchsia.

TARGET MARKET AND OUR NICHE WITHIN
 
It is essential for the Company’s success to identify a niche in the children’s clothing industry. We target young mothers and their children by creating clothes that are fun and tell stories about the children.
COMPETITION, OUR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY AND METHODS OF COMPETITION
 
The children’s clothing industry is highly competitive, and our Company faces competition ranging from large and well established companies to thousands of small mom and pop designers. We hope that if we are able to incorporate as much organic material into the Clothing Line, we will be able to differentiate ourselves
 
Our competitive strategy is based on the facts that while Adorbs is at a significant disadvantage to more established competitors due to our lack of financial resources and scarcity of relationships, we hope to stand out by using organic materials. It takes skills, knowledge and contacts to develop and sell products similar to ours. The Company believes that Ms. Lazar’s vision may allow us to tap into the organic and non-organic children’s clothing industry with a certain level of credibility. We will aim to produce creatively unique products to gain the competitive edge we need while watching closely for emerging trends.
 
MARKETING, MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
 
Adorbs markets its products and services directly to the children’s clothing community, focusing specifically on dressing children in high quality clothes that are comfortable and fun.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engaging a PR campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------

 
Currently, Ms. Lazar promotes our products through many channels, local stores and community events. While Ms. Lazar has limited experience in developing and expanding a client base and marketing products to them, we anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the children’s clothing industry and by the use of marketing consultants, which will allow qualified individuals to join Ms. Lazar on our management team and Board of Directors.
 
STATUS OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

OUR GROWTH STRATEGY MODEL
 
Our mission is to maximize shareholder value by creating and commercializing the Clothing Line with the aim of achieving profitability and sustaining growth of our business. We are attempting to advance Adorbs to become a self-sustained and profitable operational entity. To achieve and sustain business growth in the next 12 to 36 months, we will aim to implement a three-prong growth strategy model which consists of the following elements:

● | Streamlining core business 
--+-------------------------------


● | Target market penetration 
--+------------------------------


● | Utilizing business alliance opportunities 
--+----------------------------------------------

 
To streamline our core business, we will look to organize our product development and marketing operations in the most efficient manner so that a quality product is developed and sold on a continuous basis. Adorbs will seek to hire additional staff to handle administrative and customer procurement functions; outsource certain aspects of product development or engage playwrights and screenwriters to develop new intellectual property more efficiently; and add experienced professionals to the Board of Directors to oversee the company and provide professional stature to the operations. We believe that successful implementation of this strategy will provide Adorbs with a certain degree of name recognition within the children’s clothing community and a network of useful business relationships.
