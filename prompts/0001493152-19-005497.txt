ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General 
 
MariMed Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”, “MariMed”, or the “Company”) is a leader in the emerging legal cannabis industry. During 2018, the Company made a strategic decision to transition from a professional management and advisory company that provides cannabis licensing, operational consulting, and real estate services, to a direct owner of cannabis licenses and operator of seed-to-sale operations. 


The Company’s stock is quoted on the OTCQB market under the ticker symbol MRMD.
 
The Company currently provides ongoing management oversight or real estate services to six independent operations in six states – Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Rhode Island. Since entering the cannabis industry, the Company has demonstrated an excellent track record in managing state-of-the-art, regulatory-compliant facilities for the cultivation, production, and dispensing of legal cannabis and cannabis-infused products.
 
It is the Company’s plan to ultimately consolidate the ownership of the six  operating entities under the MariMed banner. The Company has started the consolidation process which is at various stages of completion due to the respective state laws governing cannabis license ownership. Once the consolidation is completed, the Company will own, manage, and operate cultivation, manufacturing and retail dispensary operations in these states. Moreover, the Company plans to leverage its success of providing management oversight in these markets to expand into other states, while focusing on regulatory compliance, efficiency and product performance.


Recognizing the emergence of the global hemp market, in late 2018, the Company purchased $30 million of subordinated secured convertible debentures (the “GC Debentures”) from GenCanna Global Inc., a leading producer and distributor of agricultural hemp, cannabidiol (“CBD”) formulations, and hemp genetics (“GenCanna”). In February 2019, the Company converted the GC Debentures plus accrued interest through the conversion date into a 33.5% ownership interest in GenCanna on a fully diluted basis. Additionally, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, MariMed Hemp Inc. in January 2019 to market and distribute hemp-derived CBD products across several vertical markets.


In addition, the Company has developed precision-dosed cannabis-infused products designed for specific medical conditions and related symptoms. These products are licensed under Company-owned brands such as Kalm Fusion™, Betty’s Eddies™, and Nature’s Heritage™, in the form of dissolvable strips, tablets, powders, microwaveable popcorn, fruit chews, and with more varieties in development. The Company also sublicenses several top brands including Lucid Mood™ disposable vape pens, Vitiprints™ printable dissolvable discs, and DabTabs™ revolutionary vaporization tablets infused with cannabis concentrates. The Company plans to continue licensing the best brands and products in the industry for distribution through its owned and client-leased dispensaries, as well as to other licensed producers in thousands of dispensaries across the country.
 
The Company’s operations have increased significantly over the past several years. For the year ended 2018:
 

● | Revenues increased 95% from approximately $6.1 million to $11.9 million; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measurement explained in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) increased 53% from approximately $1.6 million to $2.4 million; and 
● | Total assets increased 158% from approximately 32.2 million to $83.0 million. 

 
These increases are in large part the result of the successes of Company-advised clients, whose revenues grew in excess of 50% from approximately $12.2 million to $18.5 million. As a result of the Company’s strategic decision to focus on owning and operating cannabis businesses, which will include the acquisition of these clients, management fees and rental income are expected to decline, and be replaced by significant operating revenues and earnings from the directly-owned seed-to-sale cannabis and hemp operations.


Over its short history, the Company has developed an excellent reputation for strong management in the cannabis industry. As a management company, MariMed’s clients have thrived and succeeded in their respective markets. The Company’s goal is to continue this success as it transitions from a manager and advisor to an owner of cannabis licenses and operator of cannabis businesses. The Company’s strengths can be summarized as follows:
 
Professional Management
 
We have had considerable success writing award-winning applications for clients applying for licenses in new and established legal cannabis states; creating and developing defined business, operating and security plans; sourcing real estate for cannabis facilities in receptive municipalities; and raising capital to purchase and develop facilities. These skills are important as the Company expands its footprint into new states on a direct ownership basis.
 
Development of State-of-the-Art Cannabis Facilities and Operations
 
We have constructed numerous cannabis facilities in several states utilizing and developing industry “best practices” in all of our facilities, and our clients’ seed-to-sale operations in multiple states are examples of operational excellence under our proven management processes and practices.
 
Cannabis Brand Creation
 
We have developed unique brands of precision-dosed cannabis-infused products which are currently licensed and distributed in cannabis-legal states. Going forward, the Company intends to continue expanding both its brand portfolio and the licensing of its branded products into additional states.
Investment in Hemp Production
 
Our direct ownership in GenCanna, which we believe will become one of the largest hemp producers in the United States by the year 2020, will help ensure the Company has access to a safe and reliable source of hemp-based CBD. The market for hemp-based CBD products is expected to grow significantly over the next several years;
Technological and Scientific Innovation
 
We are diligent in identifying and reviewing the latest sciences and processes applicable to the cultivation, distillation, production, packaging, securing, and distribution of cannabis and cannabis-infused products. We have obtained the highest quality cannabis strains and genetics. We are at the leading edge of patient education and physician outreach for cannabis, and we seek strategic relationships with companies that are at the forefront of extraction and distillation.

Consolidation Plans
 
The Company’s strategic shift involves the acquisition of the business operations and licenses of entities to which the Company provides advisory and real estate services. The following is an overview of the consolidation process:
Massachusetts 
 
The Company successfully converted ARL Healthcare Inc. (“ARL”), its cannabis-licensed client, from a non-profit entity to a for-profit corporation with the Company as the sole shareholder. The Company now owns ARL and its cannabis licenses for cannabis cultivation, production and dispensing, with rights for up to nine statewide locations in both the medical and adult-use programs. The Company is constructing a 70,000 square foot state-of-the-art cultivation and production facility for ARL in New Bedford within the Company’s 138,000 square foot facility purchased in 2017. ARL’s manufactured cannabis products will be sold to licensed dispensaries throughout the state serving both the medical and adult-use markets.
 
The Company also owns a 22,700 square foot building in Middleborough in which a 10,000 square foot dispensary is planned to be open for business in May 2019. Furthermore, the Company intends to open two more dispensaries in the Boston area in 2019.
 
Maryland 
 
The Company has entered into a memorandum of understanding to acquire Kind Therapeutics USA Inc. (“Kind”), its cannabis-licensed client that holds licenses for the cultivation, production, and dispensing of medical cannabis. The parties are finalizing a merger document to effectuate the transaction which is conditioned on the approval by the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission, which is expected to occur in October 2019. Until then, the Company will continue to provide management and operational advisory services to Kind, whose operations are conducted within a 100,000 square foot cultivation and manufacturing facility within a Company-owed 180,000 square foot industrial building in Hagerstown. The large production capacity of this facility will enable the Company to take full advantage of a robust Maryland market consisting of over 100 planned dispensaries, most of which are not attached to a specific cultivator. Additionally, the Company has contracted to purchase a 9,000 square foot building in Anne Arundel County for the development of a dispensary, currently scheduled to open in late 2019.
Illinois 
 
In October 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire the ownership interests of KPG of Anna LLC and KPG of Harrisburg LLC, the Company’s two cannabis-licensed clients that operate Company-built and owned medical marijuana dispensaries in the state of Illinois (both entities collectively, the “KPGs”), from the current ownership group of the KPGs. As part of this transaction, the Company will also acquire this ownership group’s interests in Mari Holdings IL LLC, the Company’s subsidiary which owns the real estate in which the KPGs’ dispensaries are located. The Company is currently awaiting approval for this transaction from the state, which is expected to be received in the near future. Additionally, the state is in the process of legalizing adult-use cannabis and will permit the Company to expand into two additional locations when such legalization occurs.
Nevada 
 
In November 2018, the Company contracted to acquire 100% of the ownership interests of The Harvest Foundation LLC, the Company’s cannabis-licensed client in the state of Nevada (“Harvest”). The acquisition is conditioned upon the approval of the state cannabis commission which is in process. Harvest holds both medical and adult-use cannabis licenses, and operates in approximately 10,000 square feet of an industrial building that the Company leases and has built out into a cannabis cultivation facility.
Delaware
 
Delaware currently is a not-for-profit state with regard to the ownership of cannabis licenses. The Company provides comprehensive management and real estate services to First State Compassion Center (“FSCC”), the Company’s cannabis-licensed client which was awarded Delaware’s first ever seed-to-sale medical cannabis license, and owns two out of the four statewide licenses.
 
FSCC operates out of a Company-owned 47,000 square foot seed-to-sale facility in Wilmington, and a Company-leased 4,000 square foot retail location in Lewes. The Company has recently signed a lease with an option to purchase a 100,000 square foot building in Milford, with plans to build another cultivation and production facility to serve the state’s growing patient count.
 
The state is expected to allow “for-profit” ownership of cannabis licenses in the near future, at which time the Company will look to acquire FSCC and obtain ownership of the licenses and operations 
 
Rhode Island
 
Rhode Island currently is a not-for-profit state with regard to the ownership of cannabis licenses. The Company is in negotiations to purchase the real estate which is leased to its cannabis-licensed client, the Thomas C. Slater Compassion Center (“Slater”). Subject to state approval, the Company intends to acquire the management company that oversees Slater’s operations. After these transactions are completed, the Company will generate real estate and management fees until the state allows “for-profit” ownership, which is expected to occur in 2020. At that time, the Company will seek to acquire Slater’s cannabis licenses and operations.
New Operations – Completed Transactions & Current Activities
 
GenCanna Global Inc. 
 
In late 2018, the Company purchased the GC Debentures from GenCanna. In February 2019, the Company converted the GC Debentures plus accrued interest through the conversion date into common shares of GenCanna representing a 33.5% ownership interest in GenCanna on a fully diluted basis, and our CEO, Robert Fireman was appointed to GenCanna’s board of directors.
 
In December 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill (the “Farm Bill”) became law in the United States. Under the Farm Bill, industrial and commercial hemp is no longer classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, and explicitly allows interstate hemp commerce which will enable its legal transport and delivery across state lines.

GenCanna, based in Winchester, Kentucky, focuses on growing hemp with superior genetics and creating hemp-based products in accordance with the highest quality standards such as GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) to ensure that wholesalers and consumers receive a consistent high-quality product to meet their wellness needs. GenCanna has also become a thought leader in the hemp industry, working closely with federal and local governmental regulatory authorities.
 
During the 2018 growing season, GenCanna had nearly 1,000 acres under contract and expects to increase that number significantly in 2019 in order to meet the growing demand for hemp-derived CBD. GenCanna is currently undertaking a major facility expansion in Kentucky in order to accommodate the rapid increase in production from the considerable increase in hemp acreage.
 
MariMed Hemp
 
To optimize its investment in GenCanna, the Company established MariMed Hemp Inc. in January 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary to develop, market, and distribute hemp-based CBD brands and products, and to provide hemp producers with bulk quantities of hemp genetics and biomass. This entity is expected to offer a unique product line of high-quality hemp-based CBD wellness products eligible for distribution in all 50 states and reach a new customer base outside of the licensed-cannabis channel. This expansion into hemp-based CBD products reflects a growing consumer appetite for overall health and wellness products, and specifically those products which are CBD-based.
 
The rapid growth of legal cannabis and hemp-derived CBD markets presents a global paradigm shift and challenges to medical professionals and consumers who seek scientific knowledge and research regarding medical cannabis and hemp. Accordingly, in addition to the aforementioned objectives, one of MariMed Hemp’s priorities will be to provide credible research-based information about the health benefits of cannabis and hemp to medical providers and their patients, many of whom express a strong and growing appetite for knowledge on this topic. Armed with this knowledge, such healthcare professionals and consumers will be able to effectively and safely choose from a broad, and potentially confusing, range of cannabis products.
 
As part of its education initiative, the Company is assembling a Scientific Advisory Board (the “SAB”), that includes some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers focused on the scientific application of cannabis and hemp for health and wellness. The SAB’s goals will include the development of strategies to address the most widespread and debilitating medical and dietary conditions through the utilization of cannabis- and hemp-based therapies.
 
Meditaurus
 
To facilitate our drive for greater science and education, the Company entered into an agreement in February 2019 to acquire a 70% interest in Meditaurus LLC. Meditaurus was established by Dr. Jokubas Ziburkas, a leading authority on hemp-based CBD and the endocannabinoid system. Dr. Ziburkas holds a PhD in Neuroscience, and currently serves as Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Houston, where his research focused on cannabinoid actions in the brain and novel treatments for neurological disorders. He has published over 20 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, and is regarded as a thought leader in the global cannabis industry.
 
Meditaurus has developed proprietary formulations for hemp-derived CBD, and currently operates in Lithuania and Texas. Its Florance brand, recently launched in Germany, is marketed globally on their website. This transaction includes the commitment of Dr. Ziburkas to become the Chief Innovation Officer of MariMed, and to assist MariMed Hemp in the marketing and distribution of Florance and newly-developed products throughout the United States and Europe.


Pipeline Transactions
 
MariMed is actively pursuing other growth opportunities to expand its asset portfolio in the medical and adult-use cannabis industries. While no assurance can be given that any of these opportunities will materialize, the Company is currently in various stages of dialog to invest in or acquire several domestic and foreign entities, along with such entities’ licenses, brands and operations.
 
We are not disclosing the details of these pipeline transactions in order to maintain confidentiality. We will disclose such transactions when they are consummated.
 
Corporate History
 
The Company was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Worlds Inc. (formerly Worlds.com Inc.) under the name Worlds Online Inc. In May 2011, Worlds Inc. commenced the spin-off of the Company, which was consummated after Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) review in May 2012.

The Company’s initial ticker symbol was WORX, and since inception, the Company has operated an online portal that offers multi-user virtual environments to users. Over time, however, this business model declined, and consequently it has had insignificant operating activity since 2014. All of the underlying patents as well as the Company’s license agreement from Worlds Inc. with respect thereto have expired, and we do not expect to be engaged in this business.
 
In early 2014, the Company transitioned its operational focus to the emerging cannabis industry. In order to quickly gain traction into this new space, in May 2014, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MariMed Advisors Inc., acquired Sigal Consulting LLC (“Sigal”), a company operating in the cannabis industry.
 
The purchase price paid to the former owners of Sigal consisted of (i) an aggregate amount of the Company’s common stock equal to 50% of the outstanding shares on the closing date of September 29, 2014, (ii) options to purchase three million shares of the Company’s common stock, exercisable over five years with exercise prices ranging from $0.15 to $0.35, and (iii) a 49% ownership interest in MariMed Advisors Inc.


During the first half of calendar 2017, the Company changed its name to MariMed Inc. and its ticker symbol to MRMD. Also during this time, the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common and preferred stock were increased to 500 million and 50 million, respectively, and the Company purchased the remaining 49% interest in MariMed Advisors Inc. in exchange for 75 million shares of common stock. 


In July 2017, Robert Fireman was named as the Company’s CEO and President, and Jon R. Levine as the CFO, Treasurer, and Secretary.
 
In October 2017, the Company acquired the intellectual property, formulations, recipes, proprietary equipment, know-how, and other certain assets of the Betty’s Eddies™ brand of cannabis-infused fruit chews.
 
In May 2018, the Company acquired iRollie LLC, a manufacturer of branded cannabis products and accessories for consumers, and custom product and packaging for companies in the cannabis industry.
 
In July 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire AgriMed Industries of PA LLC (“AgriMed”), an entity that holds a Pennsylvania license for the cultivation of cannabis and cannabis products that can be wholesaled to medical marijuana dispensaries within the state. In February 2019, the Company filed a complaint against AgriMed for specific performance of their obligations under the purchase agreement.
 
In August 2018, the Company purchased a 23% ownership interest in CVP Worldwide LLC d/b/a Sprout, an entity that provides a customer relationship management and marketing platform, branded under the name Sprout, specifically designed for companies in the cannabis industry.
 
In August 2018, the Company obtained the exclusive worldwide license from Vitiprints LLC to sublicense, use, develop, promote, sell or otherwise commercialize in any way a proprietary technology that produces precision-dosed cannabis products at multiple combinations of cannabinoids, terpenes, and nutrients, into a paper-thin, low-calorie, fast-absorbing product that is delivered sublingually, transdermally, or by drinking when dissolved in liquid, all at scale and at exceedingly reduced cost.

During the period September 2018 to November 2018, in a series of investments, the Company purchased an aggregate of $30 million of subordinated secured convertible debentures of GenCanna. In February 2019, the Company converted the debentures plus accrued interest through the conversion date into a 33.5% equity interest on a fully diluted basis. 


In October 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire KPG of Anna LLC and KPG of Harrisburg LLC, the Company’s two cannabis-licensed clients that operate medical marijuana dispensaries in the state of Illinois (both entities collectively, the “KPGs”). As part of this transaction, the Company will also acquire the remaining minority interests of Mari Holdings IL LLC, the Company’s subsidiary that owns the real estate where the KPGs’ two dispensaries are located, from the KPGs’ current ownership group. The parties are currently awaiting state approval of the transaction which is expected to be received in April 2019. 


In October 2018, the Company’s cannabis-licensed client in Massachusetts, ARL Healthcare Inc. (“ARL”), filed a plan of entity conversion with the state to convert from a non-profit entity to a for-profit corporation, with the Company as the sole shareholder of the for-profit corporation. ARL holds three cannabis licenses from the state of Massachusetts for the cultivation, production and dispensing of cannabis. In November 2018, the Company received written confirmation of state approval of the conversion plan from the state, making ARL a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.


In November 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire The Harvest Foundation LLC, the Company’s client awarded a cannabis license for cultivation in the state of Nevada. The acquisition is conditional upon state approval which is expected to occur in May 2019.


In December 2018, the Company made a $500,000 investment in Iconic Ventures Inc. which has developed DabTabs™, a revolutionary product that consists of a convenient portable tablet that delivers precise dosing and acts as a storage system for full spectrum cannabinoid vaporization. Additionally, the Company secured the exclusive distribution rights for six states and is in the process of beginning distribution in the state of Maryland.
 
In December 2018, the Company executed a memorandum of understanding to merge with its cannabis-licensed client in Maryland, Kind Therapeutics LLC. A merger agreement is currently being drafted for this transaction, which is intended to qualify as a tax-deferred reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. The parties expect the merger agreement to be finalized, and the transaction approved by the state legislature in the fourth quarter of calendar 2019.
 
Business Activities
 
As previously described, the Company is in the process of transitioning from a fee for service business to a direct owner and operator of cannabis businesses across six states – DE, IL, NV, MD, MA, and RI. The Company has played a key role in the successes of these entities, from the securing of cannabis licenses to the development of facilities and providing operational guidance. Accordingly, the Company believes it is well suited to manage the continuing growth of these operations which the Company intends to ultimately own, recognizing that current ownership laws require modification in a subset of these locations.


A key reason for completing this transition is to present a simpler, more transparent financial picture to the investor community. Once the consolidation is complete, our financial statements will provide a clearer picture of the revenues, earnings, and other financial metrics that the Company is generating, rather than the current fee-for-service revenue model that reports only consulting and management fees, but obscures the true size of the Company’s overall business
 
Our team has developed state-of-the-art regulatory-compliant facilities which are models of excellence in horticultural principles, cannabis production, product development, and dispensary operations. We have developed proprietary operating processes and procedures that employ industry best practices. The Company intends to use its past success and expertise in applying for state regulated cannabis licenses to expand the footprint across the United States.
 
In addition, we are at the forefront of precision-dosed branded cannabis and hemp-derived products for the treatment of specific medical conditions. We currently enable our licensees to manufacture and distribute our branded products in ten states, and are expanding licensing and distribution to additional markets, encompassing thousands of dispensaries and additional retail outlets.


Cannabis remains a Controlled Substance under federal law which makes conventional funding difficult to obtain. However, the Company has thus far been successful in raising growth capital from private investors and funds.
 
The Company has developed a brand of cannabis-infused products that are designed to be precision-dosed for specific medical conditions and symptoms. These products are developed by the Company in cooperation with state-licensed facilities and operators who meet the Company’s strict standards, including natural— not artificial or synthetic — ingredients. We license our product formulations only to knowledgeable manufacturing professionals who agree to adhere to our precise scientific formulations using our trademarked product recipes.
 
The Company’s investment in one of the largest hemp producers in the US, GenCanna, and the introduction of MariMed Hemp, only solidifies the Company’s position as an industry thought leader.

Business Structure
 
The Company’s business has historically involved creating private limited liability companies to purchase real estate for the development of cultivation, processing, and dispensing facilities. These single-state LLCs are on occasion jointly owned by the Company and investors, with the share of ownership and the allocation of return negotiated on a deal specific basis. This structure was employed successfully in projects in Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Nevada.


As of December 31, 2018, the Company developed and provided operational oversight to clients operating six cannabis facilities in Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, and Maryland, with five additional facilities currently being developed in Maryland and Massachusetts. The Company has also assisted clients to develop additional licensed facilities in other state licensed-programs.
 
However, as previously mentioned, the Company is currently in the process of acquiring its clients’ licenses and operations. Once these acquisitions are complete, it is anticipated that all of these facilities and operations will be wholly-owned by the Company.
 
Alliances
 
The Company has entered into a licensing agreement with Tikun Olam USA, the first developer of medical cannabis products in Israel. The agreement provides the Company with the ability to sublicense certain medical cannabis genetics developed in Israel to our Delaware and Maryland clients.
 
A strategic relationship and licensing agreement between the Company and Chooze Corp. has made the Company the leading revenue generator in the United States for Chooze’s cannabis-infused mood-enhancing products such as Lucid Mood™.
 
The Company also has a strategic relationship and exclusive distribution agreement with The Healer, an entity featuring products developed by Dr. Dustin Sulak, a nationally renowned cannabis practitioner. Dr. Sulak was recently featured on CNN’s series with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on how cannabis can help patients addicted to opioids. The Healer’s whole-plant filtration process is at the core of Dr. Sulak’s quality formulations in The Healer’s products, which the Company has funded and marketed in the Maryland Medical Cannabis program. The Healer’s instore training to patient assistants and patients has been very successful in Maryland, and it intends to roll out this program in Delaware, Massachusetts, and several other states.


As previously mentioned, the Company has entered into an exclusive agreement to sublicense the innovative DabTabs™ portable tablets that deliver convenient, precisely-dosed full spectrum cannabinoid vaporization.
 
The Company’s investment in Sprout, a customer relationship management and marketing platform designed for companies in the cannabis industry, will potentially connect the Company to hundreds of legal cannabis dispensaries. The Company intends to work with these dispensaries and Sprout to develop a database of patients that utilize cannabinoid medicines for their health and wellness, and which will allow interaction with these patients for marketing and education.
 
Competition
 
The Company is in a state of transition that we expect will make it one of the more prominent multi-state cannabis companies in the industry. While we have a competitive advantage – as we have incubated our clients and supported their growth from bottom up, and we have built our own brands and products – the capital currently being raised by competing companies on the Canadian Stock Exchange and through other means has created new multi-state operators who are investing millions of dollars to purchase licensed facilities in the United States.
 
Additionally, while Company has a comprehensive suite of products and services for the cannabis industry, we face competition from companies of varying sizes and geographic reach, who produce and sell products similar to ours. Some of these companies provide a subset of our product and service offerings, while others are able to provide an equivalent level of the products and services offered by the Company. Our sales could be reduced significantly if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, more convenient, or are less expensive than our products. Going forward, as cannabis and hemp products become more mainstream and have greater acceptance, it is likely that larger and more established companies, with greater available resources including name recognition and national distribution networks, will enter the field. At the same time, we believe the emerging cannabis industry is growing at such a pace that there are more opportunities available than current cannabis businesses can support. With abundant opportunities, our Company at times works with others to insure a positive image in new and emerging states. Until recently, the black market and illegal cannabis traffickers that controlled this industry years ago from the shadows are a lesser competitive threat as such groups are diminishing.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company has currently filed for trademark protection for its branded product lines.
 
Our proprietary processing, and manufacturing techniques and technologies, while not patented at this time, are kept strictly confidential. We enter into and enforce confidentiality agreement with key employees and consultants to protect our IP and general know-how.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company expanded to a total of 28 employees, all of which were full-time. We retained a variety of supporting consultants and oversaw many employees of the cannabis-licensees we advise to implement our policies and procedures. Upon successful completion of the consolidation of business operations, the Company expects to add upwards of 400 additional employees.
