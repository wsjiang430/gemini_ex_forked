ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Unisys Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Unisys, we, our, or the company), is a global information technology (IT) solutions company that powers breakthroughs for the world’s leading organizations. Our clients rely on us to help solve many of their toughest business and technology challenges in highly complex, regulated and heterogeneous environments. From our origins dating back to 1873 through the formation of Unisys in 1986, we have built a legacy of innovation and a reputation of trust. 
Our solutions and services are provided through scaled, global delivery platforms which allow us to execute large-scale, rapid technology migration and modernization projects. We have a long track record of delivering and integrating solutions to simplify and accelerate digital transformation. 
In recent decades, the rise of the internet and new online platforms has led to an accelerated shift of enterprise and government transactions and interactions with customers, suppliers, employees, and citizens to digital channels. At the same time, market incumbents have been challenged by cloud-native competitors pushing the pace of innovation. Businesses and governments are also facing rising costs and complexity of managing enterprise infrastructure, data, security, and compliance. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and a rapid shift to hybrid and remote work models have amplified these challenges. During this time, customers and employees have increasingly come to expect seamless and personalized digital experiences. Unisys partners with clients to transform the mission-critical systems that support their daily operations in this rapidly evolving digital age.
In 2022, we launched our new Unisys brand, which marked the most significant brand transformation for the company since 1986. Our new brand is all about progress and embodies our entrepreneurial spirit and the aspirations we help our clients achieve. It is about Unisys being the catalyst that pushes people and organizations to break through to the next big innovation. 
Our Services and Solutions
Our global clients look to us to provide independent advisement, quality solutions, and essential capabilities to ensure their mission-critical projects succeed. Our services may be delivered through standalone solutions or integrated solutions that may incorporate proprietary Unisys products, a Unisys-managed service offering, and/or solutions of our trusted partners.

These solutions often involve a high level of customization, automation, and in many cases, technology and knowledge that is proprietary to Unisys. Many of our business process solutions clients seek to meet requirements for 24x7 operations or to increase business flexibility and operational efficiency through process automation, especially for high-volume or labor and time-intensive workflows.
Next-Gen Solutions
We classify our Modern Workplace, DP&A, SS&C and certain micro-market solutions as our “Next-Gen solutions,” which we believe provide us a competitive advantage within the marketplace.

We plan to continue to invest in our Next-Gen solutions to develop and deliver innovative products and services to effectively support our clients on their business transformation and modernization journeys. 
Products
We have developed a portfolio of proprietary platforms, enterprise software and technology products that support the delivery of our primary solutions. This ecosystem differentiates our offerings and may be sold as part of our solutions or, in some cases provided by our channel partners directly. The primary elements of our proprietary ecosystem are:

Go-to-Market
We market our products and solutions primarily through a direct sales force and a central marketing department focused on increasing awareness and visibility for our portfolio of services and solutions within the industry, including managing our relationships with industry analysts and consultants who can influence client decisions. Complementing our direct sales force, we make use of a select group of resellers and alliance partners to market our services and product portfolio. In many cases, we may jointly develop integrated solutions with our partners that we directly or jointly sell to our clients. In certain countries, we market primarily through distributors. 
Our direct sales force consists of a combination of global sales specialists focused on attracting new clients and cross-selling solutions, client specialists responsible for account retention and services growth, and client satisfaction and industry solution specialists responsible for supporting the specialized nature of some of our solutions and services within each of our segments. 
To support collaboration and cross-selling across our global client teams, our incentive compensation structure is based on a combination of individual, operating segment, and overall company performance. We also use a variety of shared commission structures to incentivize go-to-market collaboration.
Our Market
The markets in which we operate are broad and rapidly evolving, encompassing a wide range of technologies, services and solutions aimed at helping organizations leverage technology to improve their operations and achieve their business objectives. Organizations across the globe are harnessing technology to reimagine their businesses models and to create competitive advantages across the full spectrum of their businesses from how they interact with their clients and deliver products and services to how they develop and engage their employees. In addition to the technical expertise required to implement digital 
transformation efforts, our clients look to us for industry-specific subject matter expertise that will help them apply and implement our solutions to maximize the benefits. 
We believe our portfolio of solutions is well-aligned with the markets we serve. A few of the broader trends in the technology services and solutions market are as follows:
•Work of the Future. Hybrid work has become the new standard of working. However, organizations are challenged by the constantly evolving workforce dynamics and finding the right balance between flexibility, collaboration, corporate culture, employee morale, productivity, and financial results. Organizations are urgently looking to technology solutions to help them facilitate a work-from-anywhere environment where collaboration, culture, and productivity are not sacrificed. Unified communications as a service, modern device management, virtual desktop interface, and service desk proactive self-healing are just some of the technology organizations are implementing to enhance the overall workplace experience. 
•Hybrid and Multi-Cloud adoption. Organizations migrating workloads to the cloud are seeking flexibility in the form of hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This flexibility enables organizations to strike the most appropriate balance between resiliency, cost, scalability, and security for their data and applications. Additionally, organizations expect their cloud service providers to understand their business model and industry and to provide a flavor of cloud implementation and application development that addresses specific challenges within the industries in which they operate. 
•Proliferation of Data. Due to advancements in technology and the widespread use of connected devices, social media, and the internet of things, vast amounts of data are being generated every day, and this trend is only expected to continue. Next generation computing plays a crucial role in turning data into insights, as it provides the tools and infrastructure necessary for storing, processing, and analyzing large amounts of data. Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence can be used to identify patterns and relationships within data sets, and natural language processing can be used to extract insights from unstructured text data. 
•Process Automation. In today’s economic environment, organizations are increasingly turning to technology solutions to automate repetitive, routine tasks and processes. These solutions can take several forms - robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, or workflow automation - but they all center around improving efficiency and consistency, reducing costs, and reducing the amount of time employees spend on mundane, low-value tasks and processes. 
•Cybersecurity remains a top priority. Increased reliance on technology, growth of the internet, remote work adoption, increased cloud adoption, and the evolving sophistication of cyber attackers have all contributed to the proliferation of cyber-attacks. Now more than ever, an organization’s security posture is critically important to its ongoing ability to operate successfully. Organizations are placing a growing emphasis on end-to-end security, implementing cybersecurity solutions across the organizations from laptops, desktops, tablets, and sensors to servers, networks, and the cloud. 
Our Clients
We deliver advanced IT solutions to some of the largest commercial and public sector clients around the world. Our public sector clients primarily consist of state and local and non-U.S. governments and agencies, as well as global not-for-profit organizations. Overall, our commercial clients are well-diversified across sectors; although certain of our industry computing and business process solutions have a more concentrated client base, particularly in the areas of travel and transportation, financial services, energy, and healthcare. In 2022, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. 
Competitive Landscape
We operate in a highly competitive market that is affected by rapid change in technology in the information services and technology industries. We face competition from many domestic and foreign companies. Our primary competitors are systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. 
We compete primarily on the basis of service quality, product performance, technological innovation, price, and reputation, among other factors. We believe that our continued investment in enhancing and expanding our Next-Gen solution portfolio through our build/partner/buy strategy, coupled with investment in our go-to-market capabilities, will have a favorable impact on our competitive position. For more information on the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Our Strategy
Our growth strategy is focused on increasing the value we create for our clients, which we believe will ultimately enable us to achieve our financial objectives of improving our revenue growth, margins, and free cash flow. We create value for our clients by delivering innovative solutions tailored to meet the needs of each client by leveraging our platforms and processes that include both internal products and technology that are either proprietary to Unisys or draw from best of breed solutions embedded in our partner ecosystem. 
In that spirit, we continually evolve our solutions to enable our clients to continue making breakthroughs, optimizing their processes and furthering our mission to grow through our clients’ successes. 
We are investing in increasing the awareness and penetration of our Next-Gen solutions in order to build relationships with analysts, third party advisors as well as new and existing clients to expand our relationships with all go-to-market parties. We are also committed to growing our partner ecosystem to ensure we are able to deliver or integrate with the latest technology, applications, and platforms.
Our solutions are supported by our delivery organization, which provides comprehensive, mission-critical services that address the evolving needs of our clients who operate in complex, highly regulated industries worldwide. We continually work to optimize our global workforce and delivery model, which is a critical component to achieving the speed and cost needs of our clients in today’s marketplace. Finally, our associates are at the core of everything we do. We are committed to developing, evolving and upskilling our global associate workforce as the catalysts that drive our ability to relentlessly reimagine the status quo.
Materials
Unisys purchases components and supplies from a number of suppliers around the world. For certain technology products, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although we make every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of our suppliers to deliver components and supplies in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. For more information on the risks associated with purchasing components and supplies, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
As of January 31, 2023, Unisys owns over 455 active U.S. patents and over 35 active patents granted in eight non-U.S. jurisdictions. These patents cover systems and methods related to a wide variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, information security, cloud computing, virtualization, database encryption/management and user interfaces. We have granted licenses covering both single patents, and particular groups of patents, to others. Likewise, we have active licensing agreements granting us rights under patents owned by other entities. Our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, patent license, or related group thereof.
Unisys also maintains 24 U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, and over 340 additional trademark and service mark registrations in seventy non-U.S. jurisdictions as of January 31, 2023. These marks are valuable assets used on or in connection with our services and products, and as such are actively monitored, policed and protected by Unisys and its agents.
Seasonality
Our revenue is affected by such factors as the introduction of new services and products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of purchases. Seasonality generally has not resulted in material quarterly revenue changes. Changes in timing or terms of renewals from client to client can lead to fluctuations in software license revenue from period to period since accounting rules require that software license revenue be recognized when the license term begins. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2022, firm order backlog was $2.9 billion, compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Approximately $1.3 billion (45%) of 2022 backlog is expected to be converted to revenue in 2023. Although we believe that this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be canceled, with or without penalty. 
Human Capital
At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 16,200 professionals, of which 16% are located in the United States and 84% are located in other countries around the world. Our associates ensure our success, and we are committed to providing a productive, ethical, diverse and safe working environment for each and every one of them.
We welcome qualified associates and do not discriminate on any legally protected characteristics. We are committed to our culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) not only as the “right thing to do,” but also as a business imperative. Creating an equitable workplace improves our organization, local communities and society. 
At Unisys, we are focused on having a workforce that represents the diverse communities in which we live and serve. Based on our continued efforts to improve diverse representation, women now make up 33% of our workforce globally and associates from Underrepresented Ethnic Groups (UREG) make up 31% within the U.S. Although we are proud of our progress, the ultimate goal is to create a belonging culture, and we continue to focus on efforts to increase the diverse representation in our workforce.
In addition to our efforts focused on representation, understanding our associates’ perspectives and experiences - their engagement - is critical to our success. Each year we measure associate engagement and develop action plans to improve based on feedback. This year, more than 80% of our associates participated in the survey with 75% of participating associates indicating they are engaged. Fostering an inclusive culture is a key component of engagement and 81% of participating associates indicated they “feel comfortable being themselves at work.” Our DEI initiatives are supported by our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, which consists of more than 15 associates from around the world who work to ensure that the DEI strategy truly reflects the needs of our associates. Since 2020, we have launched several Associate Impact Groups, which are associate-led groups that provide support, career development, and professional networking for their members. These groups focus mainly on underrepresented groups at Unisys and are centered on gender, race and ethnicity, LGBTQ+, veterans and people with disabilities.
We recognize that continuous learning and professional development are key factors for our success. We offer a range of development programs and opportunities that focus on leadership/management, digital transformation skills, information technology skills, cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, diversity, anti-harassment, ethics and more.
We are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our associates a wide range of offerings through a range of benefits and resources including health and welfare benefits, flexible time-off and employee assistance programs. 
We also promote a culture of ethics and integrity through our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, policies, and training and all associates must adhere to our Code. We assess risk using data analytics, an annual risk assessment, investigations, and other compliance-related initiatives.
