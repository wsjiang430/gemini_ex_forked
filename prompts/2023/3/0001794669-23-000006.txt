ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
We are a leading independent provider of software and payment processing solutions in the United States (“U.S.”) based on total volume of payments processed. We have achieved our leadership position through decades of solving business and operational challenges facing our customers’ overall commerce needs. Our merchants range in size from small owner-operated local businesses to multinational enterprises conducting commerce throughout the world. We distribute our services through a scaled network of seasoned internal sales and support teams, as well as through our network of software partners. Our software partners are comprised of independent software vendors (“ISVs”) and value-added resellers (“VARs”). For our software partners, we offer a single integration to an international end-to-end payment offering, a proprietary gateway and a robust suite of technology solutions to enhance the value of their software and simplify payment acceptance. For our merchants, we provide a seamless, unified consumer experience and fulfill business needs that would otherwise require multiple software, hardware and payment vendors.
Merchants are increasingly adopting numerous software solutions and new digital tools to operate their business and remain competitive. The complexity of conducting commerce across multiple geographies and systems has created an enormous challenge for merchants. For example, a small business in the U.S. may use over a dozen disparate software systems to operate its business, manage interactions with its customers and accept payments. A large resort may operate an even greater number of software systems to enable online reservations, check-ins, restaurants, salon and spa, activities, parking and more. The scale and complexity of managing these software systems, often sourced from different providers, while seamlessly accepting payments is a growing challenge for merchants of any size. 
Our software partners rely on us to provide a seamless commerce experience for their customers, enterprise grade security, analytics, and compatibility with a wide network of other point of sale (“POS”) solutions.
At the heart of our business is our payments platform. Our payments platform is a full suite of integrated payment products and services that can be used across multiple channels, geographies, and industry verticals, including:
•end-to-end payment processing for a broad range of payment types;
•merchant acquiring;
•proprietary omni-channel gateway capable of multiple methods of mobile, contactless and QR code-based payments;
•complementary software integrations;
•full eCommerce capabilities, including web-store design, hosting, shopping cart management and fulfillment integrations;
•integrated and mobile POS solutions;
•security and risk management solutions; and
•reporting and analytical tools.
We also offer innovative technology solutions that go beyond payment processing. Some of our solutions are developed in-house, such as business intelligence and POS software, while others are powered by our network of complementary third-party applications. Our focus on innovation, combined with our product-driven culture, enables us to create scalable technology solutions that benefit from an extensive library of intellectual property.
In addition, our merchant base is highly diversified with no single merchant representing more than 2% of end-to-end payment volume for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
We derive the majority of our revenue from fees paid by our merchants, which principally include a processing fee that is charged as a percentage of end-to-end payment volume or as a fee per transaction. We also generate subscription revenue from licensing subscriptions to our POS software, business intelligence tools, payment device management and other technology solutions, for which we typically charge flat subscription fees on a monthly basis. Our revenue is recurring in nature because of the embedded nature of the solutions we provide and the high switching costs associated with changing providers. We also benefit from a high degree of operating leverage given the combination of our highly scalable payments platform, strong customer unit economics, and low variable costs after network fees.

Our total revenue was $1,993.6 million, $1,367.5 million and $766.9 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generated net income (losses) of $86.7 million, $(74.0) million and $(111.4) million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our gross revenue less network fees was $727.5 million, $529.0 million and $323.0 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 38% from 2021 to 2022 and 63.8% from 2020 to 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross revenue less network fees excludes the impact of the payments to merchants, included in “Gross revenue,” and payments to partners and associated expenses due to the TSYS outage, included in “Network fees” and “Other costs of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These are nonrecurring payments that occurred outside of our day-to-day operations, and we have excluded them in order to provide more useful information to investors in the evaluation of our performance period-over-period.
Our Adjusted EBITDA was $289.7 million, $167.2 million and $87.7 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing a year-over-year change of 73.3% from 2021 to 2022 and 90.6% from 2020 to 2021.

Our Shift4 Model
Our mission is to enable commerce. Solving the complexity inherent to a growing business requires a specialized approach that combines a seamless customer experience with a secure, reliable and robust suite of payments and technology offerings.
To achieve this mission, we strategically built our Shift4 Model on a three pillar foundation: (i) payments platform; (ii) technology solutions; and (iii) sales and distribution.
Payments Platform
Our payments platform provides omni-channel card acceptance and processing solutions across multiple payment types, including credit, debit, contactless card, EMV, QR Pay, and mobile wallets as well as alternative payment methods such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay and WeChat Pay. We continue to innovate and evolve our payments offering as new technology and payment methods are adopted by consumers.
Through our proprietary gateway, our payments platform is integrated with over 500 software suites including some of the largest and most recognized software providers in the world. In addition, we enable connectivity with the largest payment processors, alternative payment rails and many different payment devices. Our payments platform includes market-leading security features that help prevent consumer card data from entering the merchant’s environment.
We have designed our payments platform to be:
•Integrated – fully integrated and seamlessly connected, facilitating easy data capture and compatibility across all solutions;
•Reliable – supports the most demanding payment environments in the U.S. 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; and
•Secure – Payment Card Industry (“PCI”)-validated Point-to-Point Encryption (“P2PE”) tokenization and Europay, MasterCard and Visa (“EMV”)-ready solutions.
Our merchants have the flexibility to utilize our payments platform in one of two ways: as a gateway or as an end-to-end payment solution. End-to-end payments merchants benefit from a single, unified vendor solution for payment acceptance, devices, POS software solutions and a full suite of business intelligence tools. By consolidating these functions through a single, unified vendor solution, these merchants are able to reduce total spend on payment acceptance solutions and access gateway and technology solutions as value-added features. Gateway merchants benefit from interoperability with third-party payment processors.
Technology Solutions
Our suite of technology solutions is designed to streamline our customers’ business operations, drive growth through strong consumer engagement and improve their business using rich transaction-level data.
•SkyTab POS – We provide purpose-built POS workstations pre-loaded with powerful, mission-critical software suites and integrated payment functionality for our restaurant and stadium clients. Our SkyTab POS offering helps our merchants scale their business and improve operational efficiency while reducing total cost of ownership.
Table of Contents

•VenueNext – Our mobile-first technology solution provides stadium, theme park and entertainment venues with a frictionless commerce experience. Our VenueNext solutions include mobile ordering, countertop POS, self-service kiosk, and digital wallet to facilitate food and beverage, merchandise, and loyalty all within a white-labeled technology application that is fully integrated with our secure end-to-end payment processing platform. 
•Lighthouse – Our cloud-based suite of business intelligence tools includes customer engagement, social media management, online reputation management, scheduling and product pricing, as well as extensive reporting and analytics.
•SkyTab Mobile – Our mobile payments offering, SkyTab Mobile, provides a complete feature set, including pay-at-the-table, order-at-the-table, delivery, customer feedback and email marketing, all of which are integrated with our proprietary gateway and Lighthouse. This unique solution is relevant for merchants ranging from small and midsize businesses (“SMB”) to large enterprises and across numerous industry verticals.
•The Giving Block - Our cryptocurrency donation marketplace allows donors to easily gift a variety of cryptocurrencies to over 2,000 charities.
•Shift4Shop – Our turnkey eCommerce platform provides everything a merchant needs to build their business online. Merchants can create a webstore in minutes and choose from over one hundred design themes. Shift4Shop also provides merchants with tools to manage their product catalog, order fulfillment and inventory management, search-engine-optimization (“SEO”) and secure hosting.
•Marketplace – We enable seamless integrations into complementary third-party applications, which helps reduce the number of vendors on which our merchants rely. For example, a restaurant can enable DoorDash via Marketplace and accept orders from their existing POS, dramatically simplifying implementation and eliminating manual reconciliation of multiple systems. That same restaurant can also enable payroll, timekeeping and other human resource services, reducing the time spent on manual workflows and enhancing employee engagement. Marketplace also includes a variety of functional applications including loyalty and inventory management.
Sales and Distribution
Our payments platform and technology solutions are delivered to our merchants through our distribution network. Today, our network includes thousands of software partners and regional internal sales and support hubs, providing full coverage across the U.S. and allowing us to provide the localized support that many merchants demand. Our distribution approach and commitment to our internal sales team and software partners are part of our go-to-market strategy.
•Independent software vendors – Our solutions are connected into over 500 integrations with market-leading software providers, including some of the largest and most recognizable technology companies in the world. By integrating our payments platform into their software suites, our ISVs are able to sell a comprehensive solution to the merchant at an attractive price point.
•Internal sales and support network – We have approximately 2,300 employees based throughout the country, with significant focus on sales and customer support.
•Enterprise relationships - In addition to SMBs, we support our large enterprise relationships across thousands of locations. Our enterprise customers consist of stadiums, arenas, resorts, and airlines, among others.
•Value added resellers – We partner with VARs to sell our solutions to merchants. Our VARs include third-party resellers and organizations that provide distribution support for ISVs. VARs act as trusted and localized service providers to our merchants by providing them with software and services. This partnership enables us to expand our reach and scalability by allowing a VAR to bundle our full payments and technology product suite with other value-added services provided by the VAR.
We are selective in identifying and choosing our software partners, and we seek to align our business objectives with those that have strong networks, local expertise, high-quality merchant portfolios, and trusted relationships. Our network of software partners provides a consistent and extensive source of new merchant acquisition, with no single relationship accounting for more than 10% of our end-to-end volume for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we leverage our Shift4 Model to create strategic and economic alignment with our partners to incentivize them to continue working with us.
Our compelling value proposition enables our software partners to extend attractive pricing arrangements to our merchants. For merchants that subscribe to our end-to-end payments offering, our software partners can offer gateway and technology solutions as value-added features included in the price of our payments offering. We believe that enabling our software partners to provide a cost-effective and comprehensive bundle of solutions best supports their ability to sell our solutions and grow their businesses.

Our Solutions
Our solutions are designed to help our customers grow their businesses and include, but are not limited to:

Solution | Description 
Merchant Acquiring | Omni-channel card acceptance and processing solutions across multiple payment types, including credit, debit, contactless card, mobile wallets as well as alternative payment methods. We also provide localized settlement for international merchants. 
Gateway | Seamlessly connects merchant’s software to the payment processor of their choice enabling a wide range of payment options including traditional and alternative payments methods and provides integrations to hundreds of software suites 
Security | Security features including PCI-validated P2PE and EMV-compliance 
P2PE encrypts consumer card data from the moment a card is inserted, swiped, manually keyed or tapped, as with mobile wallets, at a secure payment device
Tokenization | Replaces cardholder data, which has universal value, with a random alphanumeric value (a token) that is only valuable within specific parameters and in a particular environment. Tokens enable a merchant to maintain transaction records without the risk of compromising consumer card dataTraditional tokens preclude a merchant from identifying their consumers, which undermines the efficacy of business intelligence solutions. Our MetaTokens provide 16-digit numeric values that remain constant for a particular consumer’s card number. MetaTokens enable a merchant to identify their consumers across multiple transactions, numerous transaction types and different revenue centers within a merchant
Risk Management/Underwriting | Risk management teams and underwriting systems assess, plan, and implement strategies to minimize risk associated with chargebacks 
Payment Device Management | Device provisioning encryption and ongoing maintenance and support 
Chargeback Management | Chargeback system provides an efficient support structure in which we work directly with the merchant, payment card networks and card issuing brands to determine liability and resolve open dispute claims 
Fraud Prevention | Our Fraud Sentry solution is an automated solution that monitors transaction activity to identify instances of employee fraud. Fraud Sentry will monitor purchase and refund activity on the POS and will notify the merchant in the event these amounts are not aligned 
Loyalty and Gift Card | Flexible, feature-rich loyalty and gift card solution for card-present and card-not-present environments 

Operations and Support Services
Our operations infrastructure is designed to deliver high-quality experiences to our customers and to drive efficiencies throughout the entire payment ecosystem. We leverage our over 30 years of operating history in the hospitality sector, as well as our enterprise domain expertise, to ensure our obligations to our customers are maintained and fulfilled effectively. Our operations and support services include:
Merchant Operations and Support
•Merchant underwriting – Our merchant underwriting team manages applications and risk evaluation of new merchants. The majority of our merchant base operates in end markets with high card-present volume and low levels of fraud and chargeback losses. In addition, our underwriting strategy offers merchants with a low risk profile expedited activation, which enhances their customer experience.
Table of Contents

•Merchant onboarding and activation – A business owner can enroll for a merchant account within minutes via our web based portal within Shift4Shop. For enterprises, our merchant onboarding and activation team works closely with our partners to ensure a high-touch transition from sales to implementation and activation. Our streamlined activation and automated approval process enables fast and frictionless merchant onboarding, providing us and our partners with enhanced speed-to-market. Our partners are typically able to board even the largest and most complex merchants within 24 hours of submitting an application.
•Merchant training – We provide a full curriculum of training materials to our merchants via a dedicated training department and content delivery platform.
•Merchant risk management – Our risk management operations are designed to monitor merchant accounts on an on-going basis. This includes dedicated security and regulatory support such as PCI compliance support, vulnerability scanning, system monitoring and breach assistance. Once a merchant is activated, our systems are configured to automatically monitor any activity that may require additional diligence, which in turn helps minimize losses associated with fraud and default.
•Merchant support – Our merchant support team responds to inquiries from merchants 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The team provides customer support for systems integrations and other technical solutions. In addition, we have a dedicated team of merchant account specialists that guide merchants through the payment acceptance process from onboarding to settlement and reporting. With strong emphasis on first-call resolution, we seek to provide exceptional payment expertise and support for our merchants. We train our customer support team to quickly identify and resolve each matter in an empathetic and professional manner which reduces repeat calls and improves our operational efficiency.
Software Partner Operations and Support
•Software integrations and compliance management – We have a team of engineers and technical support staff dedicated to support software integrations and ensure compliance with all card brand, security and regulatory requirements, including PCI and Payment Application Data Security Standard compliance support, system integration and configuration guidance.
•Partner support – We have dedicated support teams who work with our software providers to address any questions or issues that may pertain to the integration of our products and solutions into their software suites. We seek to deliver end-to-end issue resolution by bringing all appropriate disciplines together in an integrated manner, in order to optimize partner support. In addition, we help resolve issues that may pertain to our partners’ entire portfolio of merchants or incidents pertaining to a single merchant.
•Partner services – Through our partner-facing customer relationship management system, our partners are able to track each step of the activation process of their new merchant accounts in real-time. Through this system, our partners can track their merchant portfolio, including commissions, residual payments and even support calls/recordings, in an accurate and real-time manner. We have added substantial automation to these processes, which is essential to ensure optimal experience as well as financial efficiency.
Competition
We compete with a range of providers, each of whom may provide a component of our offering, but do not provide an integrated offering capable of solving complex business challenges for software partners and merchants. For certain services and solutions, including end-to-end payments, we compete with non-integrated payment processors (such as Chase Paymentech, Elavon, FIS, Fiserv and Global Payments) and integrated payment providers (such as Adyen, Lightspeed POS, Shopify, Square and Toast). For our hospitality gateway offering, we compete primarily with Elavon and FreedomPay.
While competitive factors and their relative importance can vary based on size, industry and geographic reach of software partners and merchants, we believe we compete primarily on the basis of reputation, domain expertise, scale of distribution channels, breadth of offerings, simplicity and ease-of-use of solutions, pace of innovation, price, data security and customer service. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors.
For information on risks relating to increased competition in our industry, see “Risk Factors—Business risks—Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the financial services, payments and payment technology industries may adversely affect our overall business and operations,” “Risk Factors—Business risks— Potential changes in competitive landscape, including disintermediation from other participants in the payments chain, could harm our business,” and “Risk Factors—Business risks— Our ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry trends and the needs and preferences of our merchants and consumers may adversely affect our competitiveness or the demand for our products and services.”

Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual rights to protect our proprietary software and our brands. We have registered or applied to register certain of our trademarks in the U.S. and several other countries. In addition, we have obtained or applied for patents in the U.S. and certain foreign countries on certain material aspects of our proprietary software applications. We also license intellectual property from third parties, including software that is incorporated in or bundled with our proprietary software applications. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with both our employees and third parties.
We hold 34 issued U.S. utility patents, three issued Canadian patents, one issued Mexican patent and one issued European patent related to our proprietary payments technologies. As of December 31, 2022, we also held six pending U.S. utility patent applications related to our payment technologies. If the U.S. and foreign patents currently issued to us are maintained until the end of their terms, they will expire between the year 2026 and the year 2040. The expiration of these patents is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we own a portfolio of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world and are in the process of registering for our primary trademark, Shift4 Payments.
Seasonality
Our operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality based on historic patterns of consumer and business traveler spending behaviors coupled with exposure to seasonality experienced by our mix of merchants. In the past, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly revenue with revenue typically strongest in our second and third quarters and weakest in our first quarter. As we expand into new verticals and geographies, we expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations. Other factors influencing our quarterly seasonality include the timing of specific holidays in a given fiscal year, the number of business days in a month or quarter, and the proportion of our volume derived from various merchant businesses.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business and service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the U.S. Certain of our services also are subject to rules promulgated by various card networks and other authorities, as more fully described below. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations and rules frequently change and are increasing in number.
The Dodd-Frank Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“the Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to regulate consumer financial products and services (including some offered by our partners). The CFPB may also have authority over us as a provider of services to regulated financial institutions in connection with consumer financial products.
Separately, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve to regulate debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, debit interchange transaction fees must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing, and settling the transaction. Pursuant to the regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve implementing this “reasonable and proportional” requirement, debit interchange rates for card issuers operating in the U.S. with assets of $10 billion or more are capped at the sum of $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. In addition, the regulations contain non-exclusivity provisions that ban debit card networks from prohibiting an issuer from contracting with any other card network that may process an electronic debit transaction involving an issuer’s debit cards and prohibit card issuers and card networks from inhibiting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any network that can process the transaction.
Table of Contents

Further, the ability of payment networks to impose certain restrictions are limited because the Dodd-Frank Act allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (while federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education may set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards). Depending on the card network rules, merchants are now also allowed to provide discounts or other incentives to entice consumers to pay with an alternative payment method, such as cash, checks, or debit cards. However, merchants cannot impose any additional charges for the use of credit cards.
Association and network rules
We are subject to the rules of American Express, Discover, Interlink, Maestro, Mastercard, Visa and other payment networks. In order to provide our services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as service providers with the payment networks that we utilize. Because we are not a “member bank” as defined in certain of the payment networks’ rules, we are not eligible for primary membership in certain payment networks and are therefore unable to directly access them. Instead, those payment networks require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider, which we have accomplished through a sponsorship agreement with our sponsor bank. We are registered with Visa, Mastercard and other networks as service providers for member institutions. As such, we are subject to applicable card association and payment network rules, which impose various requirements and could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by such associations and/or networks for certain acts or omissions. Our failure to comply with the networks’ requirements, or to pay the fees or fines they may impose, could result in the suspension or termination of our sponsorship by our sponsor bank or our registration with the relevant payment network(s), and therefore require us to limit or cease providing the relevant payment processing services.
Card associations and payment networks and their member financial institutions regularly update and generally expand security expectations and requirements related to the security of cardholder data and environments. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association relating to payment transactions processed by us using the Automated Clearing House Network and to various state, federal, and foreign laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions.
Privacy and information security regulations
We provide services that may be subject to various state, federal, and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including, among others, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which we refer to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada. These laws and their implementing regulations restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Certain federal, state and foreign laws and regulations impose similar privacy obligations and, in certain circumstances, obligations to notify affected individuals, state officers or other governmental authorities, the media, and consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies, of security breaches affecting personal information. In addition, there are state and foreign laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers.
As a processor of personal data of EU data subjects, we are also subject to regulation and oversight in the applicable EU Member States with regard to data protection legislation. In May 2018, the GDPR, a new European wide Regulation on data privacy came into force. The GDPR contains additional obligations on data controllers and data processors that have an establishment in the EU or are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, consumers within the EU. The GDPR includes significant enhancements with regard to the rights of data subjects (which include the right to be forgotten and the right of data portability), stricter regulation on obtaining consent to processing of personal data and sensitive personal data, stricter obligations with regard to the information to be included in privacy notices and significant enhanced requirements with regard to compliance, including a regime of “accountability” for processors and controllers and a requirement to embed compliance with GDPR into the fabric of an organization by developing appropriate policies and practices, to achieve a standard of data protection by “design and default.” The GDPR includes enhanced data security obligations, requiring data processors and controllers to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data they process and their systems. Organizations that process significant amounts of data may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer responsible for reporting to highest level of management within the business. There are greatly enhanced sanctions under GDPR for failing to comply with the core principles of the GDPR or failing to secure data.

Unfair trade practice regulations
We, our partners and certain of our merchants are subject to various federal, state, and international laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAPs”) under the Dodd-Frank Act. Various regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state attorneys general, have authority to take action against parties that engage in unfair or deceptive trade practices or violate other laws, rules, and regulations, and to the extent we are processing payments for a client that may be in violation of laws, rules, and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. For example, all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers, directly or indirectly, can be subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs. The CFPB has enforcement authority to prevent an entity that offers or provides consumer financial services or products or a service provider from committing or engaging in UDAAPs, including the ability to engage in joint investigations with other agencies, issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands, conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings, commence a civil action, grant relief (e.g., limit activities or functions; rescission of contracts), and refer matters for criminal proceedings.
Anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, sanctions, and counter-terrorist regulations
We are contractually required to comply with the anti-money laundering laws and regulations in certain countries. In the U.S., we comply with certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations (collectively “the BSA”) which are enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Justice. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws, that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures and includes anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Many other jurisdictions where we conduct business also have similar anticorruption laws and regulations. We have policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations.
We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Other group entities may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions. We have policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to identify and address compliance with sanctions programs.
Similar anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions. These laws also apply to dealings with persons specified in the lists of OFAC-like organizations of several other countries, and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. Our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations.
Human Capital
In order to continue to innovate, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Shift4 a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and with programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,300 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.

Health, Safety and Wellness The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, tools, and resources to support physical and mental health and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors. Our benefit programs are designed to offer choice, where possible, so our employees can customize their benefits to meet their and their families’ needs. 
Return to Office Our return to office policy is aimed at helping us to continue to grow and thrive in an uncertain economic environment. Over the last three years, we, like other companies, have faced uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic that required flexibility and agility to meet the changing reality. Our employees’ hard work and dedication enabled Shift4 to excel despite the pandemic and the economic realities of 2022.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, with employees’ health and well-being in mind, we successfully transitioned to a remote work environment. However, particularly as treatments improved and vaccinations became available, and as we and our employees become better equipped to navigate the impacts of COVID-19, we know we are better together where we can better capitalize on our collective strength. To that end, in 2023, we decided to return to our offices for the majority of the work week in order to better collaborate and connect with each other.
Compensation and Benefits We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. Our equity incentive plans provide for grants of awards including restricted stock units (“RSUs”). We believe our equity incentive plans foster a stronger sense of ownership and align our employees’ interests with the interests and growth of the Company. In addition to base compensation and awards granted pursuant to equity incentive plans, we offer benefits including a 401(k) Plan and matching, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs. With respect to our 401(k) Plan and matching policy, we match 100% of employee contributions up to 3% of the employee’s base salary in the form of cash and we match 100% of employee contributions up to an additional 3% of the employee’s base salary in the form of RSUs, a third of which vest each subsequent year and which are subject to continued employment.
Building Connections — With Each Other and our Communities We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteer opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members.
In addition, we have a Corporate Social Responsibility program, Shift4Cares, pursuant to which we have provided structure around our various volunteer and outreach programs across the country led by our Director of Corporate Citizenship. With the support of executive management, this program is driven by our employees and includes company-wide events that cover many aspects of community, environmental, and volunteer support.
Since our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. With offices around the world, each Shift4 location has a Shift4Cares Ambassador who donates their time to help lead our Shift4Cares program at the local level. Each employee receives 16 hours of paid volunteer time off (“VTO”). In 2022, participation in the VTO program was more than 40% higher than in 2021 based on hours volunteered and number of employees who got involved. In addition, in 2022, Shift4Cares made its largest monetary donation to date to various non-profits, totaling over $1.0 million. This was made possible through different Shift4Cares initiatives throughout the year.
Diversity & Inclusion Shift4 is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our company culture is the result of our behaviors, our personal commitments, our curiosity, how we collaborate, and the ways that we courageously share our perspectives and encourage others to do the same.
Shift4 is dedicated to elevating the diverse and marginalized voices, perspectives, and experiences of our employees and others. We want everyone to be seen, heard, and advocated for. In 2022, we launched two Employee Inclusion Networks, through which we aim to empower and inspire our employees. The 2022 groups focused on those who identify as women and LGBTQIA+.
We believe that diversity & inclusion initiatives such as this expand our talent acquisition recruitment efforts, increase retention of our diverse workforce, and maintain a sense of belonging among employees. In July 2022, we administered our first-ever DE&I survey to analyze the state of inclusion at Shift4. Over 30% of the employee population at Shift4 identifies as a woman and over 40% identifies as a person of color.
Recruitment We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. In addition to our in-house talent and recruitment department, we have established relationships with professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent.
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, and innovative work to attract talent to our Company. We empower our employees to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions.
