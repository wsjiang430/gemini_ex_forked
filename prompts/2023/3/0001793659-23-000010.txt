ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context requires otherwise, each of the terms the “Company,” “Rush Street Interactive,” “RSI,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms used herein refer collectively to Rush Street Interactive, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a leading online gaming and entertainment company that focuses primarily on online casino and online sports betting in the U.S., Canadian and Latin American markets. Our mission is to engage and delight players by delivering friendly, fun and fair betting experiences. In furtherance of this mission, we strive to create an online community for our customers where we are transparent and honest, treat our customers fairly, show them that we value their time and loyalty, and listen to feedback. We also endeavor to implement industry leading responsible gaming practices and provide our customers with a cutting-edge online gaming platform and exciting, personalized offerings that will enhance their user experience.
We provide our customers with an array of leading gaming offerings such as real-money online casino, online sports betting, and retail sports betting (i.e., sports betting services provided at bricks-and-mortar locations), as well as social gaming, which involves free-to-play games that use virtual credits that users can earn or purchase. We launched our first social gaming website in 2015 and began accepting real-money bets in the United States in 2016. Currently, we offer real-money online casino, online sports betting and/or retail sports betting in 15 U.S. states and the international markets as outlined in the table below.

Our real-money online casino and online sports betting offerings are currently provided under our BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse brands in the United States and Canada and under our RushBet brand in Latin America (which includes Mexico). We operate and/or support retail sports betting for our bricks-and-mortar partners primarily under their respective 
brands. Many of our social gaming offerings are marketed under our partners’ brands, although we also offer social gaming under our own brands as well. Our decision about what brand or brands to use is market- and partner-specific, and is based on brand awareness, market research, marketing efficiency and applicable gaming rules and regulations.
Corporate History, Background and Business Combination
We were initially a blank check company called dMY Technology Group, Inc. (“dMY”), incorporated as a corporation in Delaware on September 27, 2019, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 29, 2020, dMY completed the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement dated as of July 27, 2020, as amended and amended and restated (the “Business Combination Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereby, the “Business Combination”), and in connection therewith: (i) dMY acquired Rush Street Interactive, LP (“RSILP”) in an umbrella partnership–C corporation (“Up-C”) structure, in which substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by RSILP, and the Company’s only assets are its equity interests in RSILP; (ii) the holders of equity interests of RSILP (the “Sellers”) retained certain of their Class A common units of RSILP (the “RSILP Units”) and received an equal number of the Company’s Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class V Voting Stock”); (iii) the Company issued and sold to subscribers in a private placement an aggregate of 16,043,002 shares of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Class A Common Stock”); and (iv) dMY changed its name to “Rush Street Interactive, Inc.”
The Sellers have the right to exchange the RSILP Units retained by them (the “Retained RSILP Units”) for either one share of Class A Common Stock or, upon certain conditions, the cash equivalent of the market value of one share of Class A Common Stock. For each Retained RSILP Unit so exchanged, the Company will cancel one share of Class V Voting Stock.
A description of the material terms of the Business Combination and ancillary agreements entered into in connection therewith is set forth in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 5, 2021 and the Registration Statement on Form S-1, Registration No. 333-252810, filed with the SEC on February 5, 2021, and as amended from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Our Business and Operating Models
We enter new markets by leveraging our proprietary online gaming platform and our ability to provide either a full-suite service model or a customized solution to fit a specific situation. Our business model is designed to be nimble, innovative and customer-centric. By leveraging our dynamic proprietary online gaming platform and our operational expertise, we generally aim to be “first to market” where real-money online gaming has been newly legalized and where our management determines that it is desirable to enter such market.
Our principal offerings are our real-money online casino and online sports betting products. These products can be launched under one of our existing brands or customized to be incorporated into a local or third-party brand. We also provide a variety of retail sports betting solutions to service land-based casino and other partners and leverage our social gaming offerings to increase customer engagement and build online databases in key markets both before and after legalization and regulation.
We currently generate revenue through two operating models: (i) business-to-consumer (“B2C”) and (ii) business-to-business (“B2B”). Through our primary operating model, B2C, we offer online casino, online sports betting and social gaming directly to the end customer through our websites or apps. Our B2C operations contributed more than 98% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and we expect that it will continue to be our primary operating model into the future. We believe our B2C model is flexible, permitting us to customize our operating structure based on applicable gaming regulations, market demands and, as applicable, our land-based partner’s operations. Through our B2B operations, we offer retail sports betting services to land-based businesses such as bricks-and-mortar casinos in exchange for a monthly commission.
Often in advance of markets legalizing online gaming, we build relationships with local bricks-and-mortar casino operators and other potential land-based partners who are looking for online gaming and sports betting partners. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the applicable gaming regulations require online gaming operators that offer real-money offerings to operate under the gaming license of, or partner with, a bricks-and-mortar casino or other type of local partner such as a professional sports team. Consequently, we leverage our relationships with bricks-and-mortar casinos and others in the gaming industry to find high-quality, reliable partners for online gaming collaboration. Upon securing a partner for access 
to a specific market (if required or desirable) and before we launch operations in that market, we customize our online gaming platform to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction. Then, upon entering a new market, we employ a number of marketing strategies to obtain new customers as well as leverage our partner’s database when applicable. We continuously refine our offerings and marketing strategies based on data collected from each market.
To attract, engage, retain and/or reactivate customers, we offer a loyalty program that rewards customers in exciting, fair and transparent ways. We recognize and reward customer loyalty by, among other things, ensuring that there are exciting benefits at each of the customer loyalty levels we currently offer. Each of our online gaming customers is a member of our customer loyalty program. We grant bonus store points to our customers based upon completed bets. Once earned, these points can be redeemed to unlock bonus incentives and to play our proprietary bonus games, providing further opportunities to win prizes and bonus dollars. Customers may also “bank” awarded bonuses in our proprietary “bonus bank”, which they can draw from whenever they wish under our industry-leading 1x wager playthrough requirement, meaning that they need only place one bet with the bonus dollars before cashing out any winnings. Based on research and customer feedback, we attempt to address customer concerns about the general lack of transparency in the industry around awarding, redeeming and tracking bonuses by enabling customers to easily track their loyalty and bonus progressions and giving customers control over when and how to redeem their rewards.
We strive to be the first online operator to launch in most new markets (or launch our online operations on the first day possible), and we have been successful in doing such in many markets such as Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Ontario, Canada. However, we have also achieved success when we were not the first to enter a market. For example, we entered the New Jersey online casino market approximately three years after that market opened and there were already numerous competitors in the market at that time. Less than three years after beginning operations in New Jersey, we were the #4 online casino brand in New Jersey based on revenue, out of 19 total operators in the market at that time, according to the Eilers & Krejcik Gaming (“EKG”) United States Online Casino Tracker for April 2019.
We believe our success in New Jersey is also noteworthy because we compete with many other companies that have affiliated land-based casinos there. Neither us nor RSG, an affiliated land-based casino operator, operate a bricks-and-mortar casino in New Jersey. Thus, we believe our performance in New Jersey demonstrates that we can be successful in entering competitive markets even without the benefit of an affiliated bricks-and-mortar casino presence.
Competitive Strengths
As we continue to expand in existing and new jurisdictions, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain and build upon our accomplishments by virtue of our competitive strengths:
Proprietary Online Gaming Platform. Owning a proprietary online gaming platform has allowed us to innovate quickly and introduce numerous unique, user-friendly features. We believe these features have helped increase conversion rates from registrations to first-time depositors, improve customer engagement and retention, and increase customer spending. Further, we can update our online gaming platform at a rate that we believe is among the fastest in the industry. As the U.S. online gaming industry develops, our online gaming platform should help us better cater to the evolving needs of our current and potential customers and partners. In the long run, we anticipate that our online gaming platform will lead to reduced costs and improved revenue per customer relative to our peers, many of which license their online platforms from third parties.
Unique and Diversified Product Offering. We have prioritized customizing our offerings, bonusing our customers effectively and optimizing our platform. For example, we have developed some of our own online casino games, which are higher margin for us than those licensed from third parties. We have also developed and incorporated numerous proprietary bonusing features such as our slot tournaments and proprietary squares game, which appeal to casino and sports betting customers alike. Our omni-channel platform provides a vast amount of functionality such as location-based decisioning, unified conditional bonusing, gamified award scenarios, customer dashboards (online and at retail), promotional games, real-time awards and promotion management, sophisticated reporting and responsible gaming features, among others.
Market Access and Speed to Market. We currently operate online casino and/or online sports betting in 18 jurisdictions, including 15 states (Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia) and three international markets (Colombia, Ontario, Canada and Mexico) with an aggregate population of approximately 316 million people. In addition, we have currently secured potential market access to Missouri and if certain conditions are met, Texas, in each case subject to 
certain legislative and/or regulatory developments or approvals, which have an aggregate population of approximately 36 million people. We have a proven ability to quickly enter markets as they are regulated. For instance, in the last 24 months, we have been “first to market” or among the “first to market” where multiple operators were granted approval to launch at the same time, in Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Ontario, Canada for online sports betting and/or casino, as applicable.
Flexible Business Model. We believe we are well positioned to serve new jurisdictions regardless of the form of their regulations, if any. Our flexible business model enables us to function as a B2C operator or a B2B supplier or joint venturer, depending on market conditions, applicable laws and regulations, and the needs of our partners. This flexibility should allow us to have a core advantage in securing market access and help us address the largest potential total addressable market (“TAM”).
Large TAM with International Opportunity. We believe our TAM is larger than most North America-only operators because of our international real-money online gaming and betting operations in Colombia and Mexico as well as our flexible business model as described directly above. We believe this experience will help us enter other Latin American markets and beyond.
Broad Demographic Appeal of our Brands & Products. We also believe that our brands, offerings and marketing strategies appeal to both female and male customers, as evidenced by an approximately 53-47 female/male split in our active North American online casino-only customers during calendar year 2022. We believe that while many sports-centric brands appeal more to male customers, our brands and offerings (especially our slot machine game play experience) appeal strongly to female customers – an important demographic for high-value offerings such as online slot machine games.
Compelling Unit Economics. Based on our performance to date, including in some of the most competitive U.S. markets in terms of the number of online gaming operators, we believe that we can achieve customer lifetime value levels that are among the highest in the industry. We measure lifetime value as total net revenue generated over a customer’s lifetime with us. As demonstrated in the chart below, the average lifetime value of our North American customer cohorts since January 2017 generally trends higher as the cohorts mature, with our oldest player cohorts having an average lifetime value of over $6,000. This is particularly true for customer cohorts in jurisdictions where both our online casino and our online sports betting offers are available.
Average Lifetime Value for All U.S. and Ontario Cohorts Since Inception
Source: RSI management estimates based on the average long-term value of all cohorts since January 2017 presented in monthly increments, as measured from the month of first deposit. A cohort represents all U.S. and Ontario-based first-time depositors in a particular month.
Seasoned Executive Team. Our executive team has significant global gaming experience, including with online market leaders such as WMS Industries (now Scientific Games), Playtech, the Kindred Group and Gaming Partners International Corporation. Our Chief Executive Officer Richard Schwartz, Chief Information Officer Einar Roosileht, Chief Operating Officer Mattias Stetz and Chief Administrative Officer Rob Picard all had online gaming experience prior to joining RSI, which we believe has been instrumental in helping capture U.S. market share. Our Executive Chairman Neil Bluhm has a proven track record of developing world-class land-based casinos and has developed numerous successful real estate projects.
Social Gaming Platform. We offer social gaming on the same proprietary online gaming platform as our real-money offerings, which allows us to build user databases in jurisdictions where we do not yet offer real-money gaming. Having both of these products on the same platform allows us to invest in markets before real-money gaming has launched. We believe our social gaming offering strengthens brand awareness and engagement from existing customers, helps to acquire new customers and drives increased visitation to our partners’ bricks-and-mortar properties.
Growth Strategies
As we continue to invest in our core competitive advantages and improve the customer experience, we believe we will remain well positioned to continue to grow our business with a focus on long-term profitability. We have established several key areas of strategic focus that will guide the way we consider our future growth:
Access new geographies. With our experience in regulated gaming jurisdictions in the Americas, we are prepared to enter new online casino and/or sports betting markets once management has determined it is desirable to do so. Whether we enter a new jurisdiction as an online operator marketing directly to end users or on behalf of our land-based partner (B2C), as a platform provider to a third-party (B2B), or any permutation of the foregoing, our goal is to be ready to enter desirable jurisdictions when we believe conditions enable us to earn a strong return on our invested capital.
Leverage existing customer-level economics to increase marketing spending. Since January 2017, the average long-term value of our North American customer cohorts has trended upwards as the applicable cohort matures. We may see opportunities to leverage those attractive economics to increase marketing spending in certain jurisdictions on a strategic basis and where we project acquiring incremental customers will generate gross margin that exceed our internal targets.
Continue to invest in our offerings and our platform. We have established a set of competencies that we believe position us at the forefront of the evolving online casino and sports betting industry. We will continue iterating on our core user experiences while reinforcing the data-driven, marketing and technological infrastructure that allows us to continue to scale our offerings. We plan to continue to invest in our customers and our offerings as we remain driven to keep customers engaged while expanding the capabilities of our platform that will enable us to rapidly reach new jurisdictions and attract new customers.
Continue to invest in personnel. In furtherance of accessing new jurisdictions, we have been and plan to continue to grow our operational, technology and corporate services teams to broaden product development capabilities, innovation and efficiency, reduce reliance on third parties and scale digital user capabilities.
Acquisitions. On a targeted basis, we will seek out acquisition targets that enable us to accelerate our technology plans, obtain exclusive content, expand our customer reach or add efficiencies that potentially bring third-party costs in-house.
Human Capital Resources
We strongly believe that our people are key to our success. As such, we focus heavily on our people, starting with the recruiting process to ensure we are hiring the right people who have a desirable skill set while enhancing our corporate culture. Once hired, we strive to empower our people and encourage creativity, collaboration and entrepreneurship. We provide, among other things, on-the-job training and access to professional and technical coaches to support the development, advancement and engagement of our employees. Our corporate culture focuses heavily on valuing employees and enabling them to grow, succeed and take on roles and projects that utilize their strengths. Recognizing our people’s accomplishments, both professionally and personally, is also crucial to our corporate culture. Furthermore, we believe that developing a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace for our people will enable our people to be more productive and ultimately will result in our long-term success. Our flexible paid time off programs permit our employees to pursue personal interests and goals away from their day-to-day job responsibilities. We also offer our team members opportunities to get involved with various charitable and community organizations through volunteering and sponsorships.
We have built a team of talented industry professionals, primarily focused on technology and operations, who are supported by a highly experienced senior management team with significant experience in the gaming industry. We believe our corporate culture combined with our growth and success have created very high rates of employee retention.
As of March 1, 2023, we had a global workforce of approximately 700 employees and contractors, with approximately 40% of our people working in technical roles. Approximately 44% of our people are based in the United States with the remaining 56% being based elsewhere in the world, including Canada, Colombia, Estonia and Serbia. 
Our Products and Economic Model
Our Revenue-Generating Product Offerings
We currently offer real-money online casino, online sports betting and/or retail sports betting in 15 U.S. states, Colombia, Ontario, Canada and Mexico. We also provide social gaming (where permitted) where users can earn or purchase virtual credits to enjoy free-to-play games.
Our revenue is predominantly generated from our U.S. and Canada operations, with the remaining revenue being generated from our Latin America (including Mexico) operations. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We generate revenue primarily through the following offerings:
Online Casino
Online casino offerings typically include the full suite of games available in bricks-and-mortar casinos, such as table games (i.e., blackjack and roulette) and slot machines. For these offerings, similar to bricks-and-mortar casinos, we generate revenue through hold, or gross winnings, as customers play against the house. Like bricks-and-mortar casinos, there is volatility with online casino, but as the number of bets placed increases, the net revenue retained from bets placed becomes easier to predict. Our experience has been that online casino revenue is less volatile than sports betting revenue.
Our online casino offering consists of a combination of licensed content from leading industry suppliers, customized third-party games and a small number of proprietary games that we developed in-house. Third-party content is usually subject to standard revenue-sharing agreements specific to each supplier, where the supplier generally receives a percentage of the net gaming revenue generated from its casino games played on our platform. In exchange, we receive a limited license to offer the games on our platform to customers in permitted jurisdictions. We generally pay much lower fees on revenue generated through our in-house developed casino games such as our multi-bet blackjack (with side bets: 21+3, Lucky Ladies, Lucky Lucky) and single-deck blackjack, which primarily relate to hosting/remote gaming server fees and certain intellectual property license fees.
Online casino revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in the progressive jackpot reserve.
Online Sports Betting
Online sports betting involves a user placing a bet on the outcome of a sporting event, a sports-related activity or a series of the same, with the chance to win a pre-determined amount, often referred to as fixed odds. Online sports betting revenue is generated by setting odds such that there is a built-in theoretical margin in each sports bet offered to customers. While sporting event outcomes may result in revenue volatility, we believe that we can achieve a positive long-term betting win margin. In addition to traditional fixed-odds betting, we also offer other fixed-odd sports betting products including in-game betting and multi-sport and same-game parlay betting. We have also incorporated live streaming of certain sporting events into our online sports betting offering.
Integrated into our online sports betting platform is a third-party risk and trading platform currently provided by certain subsidiaries of Kambi Group plc.
Online sports revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in unsettled sports bets.
Retail Sports Betting
We provide retail sports betting services to certain land-based partners in exchange for a monthly commission that is calculated based on the land-based retail sportsbook revenue. Services generally include ongoing management and oversight of the retail sportsbook (i.e., within a bricks-and-mortar location), technical support for such partner’s customers, risk management, advertising and promotion, and support for third-party sports betting equipment.
In addition, certain relationships with our partners provide us the ability to operate the retail sportsbook at the land-based partner’s facility. In this scenario, revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less other incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in unsettled retail sports bets.
Social Gaming
We provide social gaming (where permitted) where users can earn or purchase virtual credits to enjoy free-to-play games. Users who exhaust their credits can either purchase additional virtual credits from the virtual cashier or wait until their virtual credits are replenished for free. Virtual credits have no monetary value and can only be used within our social gaming platform.
Our social gaming business has three main goals: build online databases in key markets ahead of and post-legalization and regulation; generate revenues; and increase engagement and visitation to our bricks-and-mortar partner properties. Our social gaming products are a marketing tool that keeps the applicable brands present in the minds of our users and engages with users through another channel while providing the entertainment value that users seek. We also leverage our social gaming products to cross-sell to our real-money offerings in jurisdictions where real-money gaming is authorized.
We recognize deferred revenue when users purchase virtual credits and revenue when those credits are redeemed. We pay a percentage of the social gaming revenue derived from the sale and redemption of the virtual credits to content suppliers as well as to our land-based partners.
Costs and Expenses
Costs of Revenue. Costs of revenue consist primarily of (i) revenue share and market access fees, (ii) platform and content fees, (iii) gaming taxes, (iv) payment processing fees and chargebacks and (v) salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation for dedicated personnel. These costs are primarily variable in nature and should typically correlate with the change in revenue. Revenue share and market access fees consist primarily of amounts paid to local partners that hold the applicable gaming license, providing us the ability to offer our real-money online offerings in the respective jurisdictions. Our platform and content fees are primarily driven by costs associated with third-party casino content, sports betting trading services and certain elements of our platform technology, such as geolocation and know-your-customer. Gaming taxes primarily relate to taxes levied on gaming revenues and are determined on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We incur payment processing costs on customer deposits and occasionally chargebacks (i.e., when a payment processor contractually disallows customer deposits in the normal course of business).
Advertising and Promotions Costs. Advertising and promotion costs consist primarily of costs associated with marketing our offerings via different channels, promotional activities and related customer acquisition costs. These costs also include salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation for dedicated personnel and are expensed as incurred.
Our ability to effectively market is critical to our success. Using experience, dynamic learnings and analytics, we leverage marketing to acquire, convert, retain and re-engage customers. We use a variety of earned media and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers, brand ambassadors, proprietary content and unique game and site features, to attract and engage customers. Further, we continuously optimize our marketing spend using data collected from our operations. Our marketing spend is based on a return-on-investment model that considers a variety of factors, including the product offerings in the jurisdiction, the performance of different marketing channels, predicted lifetime value, marginal costs and expenses and behavior of customers across various product offerings.
With respect to paid marketing, we use a broad array of advertising channels, including television, radio, social media platforms, sponsorships, affiliates and paid search, and other digital channels. We also use other forms of marketing and outreach, such as our social media channels, first-party websites, media interviews and other media spots and organic searches. These efforts are primarily concentrated within the specific jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate. 
We believe there is significant benefit to having a flexible approach to advertising spending as we can quickly redirect our advertising spending based on dynamic testing of our advertising methods and channels.
General Administration and Other. General administration and other expenses consist primarily of administrative personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, share-based compensation expense for dedicated personnel, professional fees related to legal, compliance, audit and consulting services, rent and insurance costs.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on our property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets (including market access licenses, gaming jurisdictional licenses, internally developed software, trademark and developed technology) and finance lease right-of-use assets over their useful lives. See Notes 2, 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Distribution
We distribute our online offerings through various channels, including websites (traditional and mobile), direct application downloads and global direct-to-consumer digital platforms such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play store. We distribute our retail offerings primarily through self-service betting terminals and stand-alone computer terminals.
We have developed proprietary technology, product offerings and partnerships to create a sustainable advantage in the online casino and sports betting industry. Strategic multi-year arrangements with partners such as bricks-and-mortar casinos, Native American tribes or professional sports teams enable us to make our offerings available to customers in certain jurisdictions on a B2C basis. We have numerous arrangements in place where legislation or regulations require us to enter the market through a relationship with a local partner or we have otherwise determined that having such an arrangement is desirable. We also have relationships with several land-based partners on a B2B basis.
Our Development Team
Our development team is led by our Chief Information Officer, Einar Roosileht, and consists of a set of cross-functional product development teams comprised of talented individuals with expertise in system architecture, client and server-side product engineering, database architecture, product, engineering and project management, website and native app design and development, security and technical support. Consistent with our overall corporate strategy, the team constantly aims to innovate and differentiate our online offerings.
Proprietary Online Gaming Platform
Our proprietary online gaming platform has been developed and is operated by a seasoned team with global online gaming experience operating across product categories, with particular expertise in the two largest online/mobile product categories: casino and sports betting. We believe our online gaming platform and technology stack give us the ability to provide a personalized, data-driven user journey. The ability to customize the playing experience for each user is a key feature of our online gaming platform. We achieve user personalization by analyzing user history and transactions, and offering customized promotions and real-time, betting-driven bonusing.
As demonstrated in the image below, in addition to developing a robust online gaming platform, we have developed and are continuing to improve proprietary modules for our online casino and sports betting product verticals to offer a unique and differentiated experience to our customers. Such modules include both frontend and backend components and flexible management tools, which our operations teams use to customize experiences for different user segments. Content for both online casino games and sports betting offers primarily comes from integrated third parties. In addition to developing proprietary technology, as a vertically integrated technology company we operate our own products and platform, with our customer service and marketing operations teams leveraging powerful existing analytics solutions, which are a part of our online gaming platform.
We can develop and implement new features in real-time, which we believe enhances the customer experience and increases customer retention. By owning our own online gaming platform, we can more easily improve and customize the user experience and incorporate key aspects of our operational services into our offerings:
•Payments & Risk Management
•Regulatory Online Reporting & Accounting / Online Gaming Compliance
•Website Management / Games Management / Live Tech Ops / Security
•Online Affiliate Management & Tracking
•Retention / CRM / Business Intelligence & Analytics
•Customer Service
In addition, owning our online gaming platform enables us to prioritize speed to market for new offerings while providing an engaging and unique user experience. Since 2016, we have leveraged our platform to expand our real-money operations and launch in new markets. Additionally, we were the first company to launch (or among the first to launch if multiple operators launched on the same day) online or retail sports betting in many of the markets in which we operate, which we believe has allowed us to acquire customers at a lower cost than we could have if launching in a more mature market.
Our Industry and Opportunity
We currently operate within the online gaming and entertainment industry. The global gaming industry includes a wide array of products such as lotteries, bingo, slot machines, poker, casino games, sports betting, horse racing, e-sports and virtual sports, across land-based and online platforms. The industry has various operators and stakeholders in the private and public sectors, including traditional bricks-and-mortar casinos, state-run lottery operators, Native American tribes, legacy online gaming operators, non-traditional operators such as consumer goods or services brands that have entered or intend to enter the industry, racetracks/racinos/video lottery terminals, private equity or other investment funds, gaming content and data providers, gaming regulators, gaming technology companies, sports teams and leagues, and payment processors.
In recent years, online gaming has seen outsized growth and increased penetration. Based on data from EKG, online sports and casino revenue grew at a 131% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2019 to 2022. Continued growth is expected as more states regulate and markets mature, with EKG projecting revenue to grow by more than $14 billion from 2022 to 2027, or a CAGR of 17%.
We believe the following trends are potential drivers of growth in this industry: 
•New U.S. and international jurisdictions authorizing and/or privatizing their online casino and online sports betting industries; 
•Increasing consumer adoption of digital and online activities, including casino and sports betting. While many other large U.S. industries (i.e., banks, retail stores, movies, etc.) digitalized over a decade ago, the U.S. gaming industry has just started to do so more recently; and
•Expanding support and acceptance from other industry stakeholders, including sports teams and leagues, media companies and financial institutions.
In the past decade, there has been significant regulatory momentum with respect to online gaming across the globe. This momentum has been particularly relevant in developed nations whose citizens generally have disposable income to spend on entertainment and gaming. For example, the UK, Denmark, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland have legalized and regulated online casino and online sports betting. In addition, Mexico, and in recent years numerous U.S. states, Colombia and certain provinces in Argentina and Canada have legalized and/or regulated online gaming. All these countries are in the “high income” income group according to the World Bank. We expect this trend to continue into the future, most notably in the United States.
U.S. Gaming Industry
We see tremendous opportunity in the U.S. online gaming market. As U.S. jurisdictions become regulated and mature, online gaming penetration may approach that of other developed nations. For example, online casino and online sports betting revenues in the United States increased 63% from $7.5 billion in 2021 to $12.2 billion in 2022 per EKG. Despite this rapid growth, some of the most populous U.S. states such as California, Florida and Texas have not yet authorized online casino or online sports betting, and New York has not yet authorized online casino. Thus, we believe that the U.S. online gaming market remains a significant growth opportunity for us.
U.S. Online Casino
Currently, online casino is authorized in fewer states than sports betting. Online casino is authorized only in seven states: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Nevada (although regulators have not authorized online casino outside of physical casinos in Nevada). We believe there is great potential for revenue growth as new markets open in the United States. Per EKG, online casino revenue in the U.S. grew by 38% from $3.9 billion to $5.31 billion. From 2019 to 2022, online casino revenue grew at a 119% CAGR based on data from EKG, largely driven by an increasing number of U.S. states regulating and immaturity of the market. EKG expects continued growth in the U.S. online casino market as more states regulate and markets mature, with projected revenue to exceed $12 billion by 2027. These projections imply a CAGR from 2022 to 2027 of 16%.
In the latter half of 2013, New Jersey became the first U.S. state to legally permit online casino. That market got off to a slow start; however, online casino revenue in New Jersey has risen steadily over the last several years. Notably, online casino revenue was not negatively impacted when New Jersey began permitting online sports betting in 2018. Online casino revenue from slot machines and table games in New Jersey grew from $277.3 million in 2018 to $461.8 million in 2019 according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Furthermore, land-based casino revenue in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania grew during from 2021 to 2022 according to data from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, showing that land-based casino revenue can grow at the same time that online casino revenue grows. This fact may serve as a catalyst for lawmakers in other states with land-based casinos to consider authorizing online casino.
We believe that more states either have and will consider authorizing online casino for the following reasons, among others:
•We believe that COVID-19 and/or an economic slowdown has resulted in increased expenses and/or reduced tax revenue in many states, increasing the need for new sources of tax revenue.
•We believe that COVID-19 caused increased general consumer adoption of digital activity, including online gaming.
•Online casino generated more tax revenue compared to online sports betting in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in 2022, meaning authorizing online sports betting alone may not optimize tax revenue.
•Land-based casino revenue grew as online casino revenue grew in New Jersey from 2021 to 2022, demonstrating that land-based casino revenue can grow with online casino revenue.
•We believe that the land-based casino industry, an important stakeholder in many states, generally has shown a wider acceptance of online casino.
Both Pennsylvania and New Jersey were experiencing online casino taxable revenue growth prior to COVID-19; however, that growth accelerated in March 2020 and continued in large part through the fourth quarter of 2022. The charts below highlight the growth of online slot and table games taxable revenue in New Jersey and Pennsylvania since the second half of 2019:

U.S. Sports Betting
On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Profession and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (“PASPA”) – a nationwide ban of sports betting – was unconstitutional, thus allowing states (beyond the few states that were grandfathered into PASPA) to enact their own sports betting laws. Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, as of the date hereof, 35 states and the District of Columbia have authorized sports betting. Of those 36 jurisdictions, 26 states have authorized statewide online sports betting while 10 remain authorized for retail-only at casinos or retail locations.
According to EKG, the United States generated approximately $6.9 billion in online sports betting revenue in 2022. While the overall industry is still nascent, growth to date has been strong. Online sports betting revenue grew at a 141% CAGR from 2019 to 2022 according to EKG, driven mainly by an increasing number of states regulating and the immaturity of the market. EKG projects continued growth as more states regulate and markets mature, with forecasts for online sports betting revenue to exceed $14 billion by 2027. 
U.S. Sports Betting Policy Landscape
Source: EKG United States Sports Betting Policy Monitor – Released January 2023
We believe the U.S. sports betting market still has significant opportunity for growth. Only approximately 47% of the United States currently has access (or is expected to have access) to online sports betting, per EKG. This fact is significant when one considers that according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, more than 94% of the sports betting revenue in 2022 came via online betting. Populous states such as California, Florida and Texas have not yet legalized online sports betting. We believe the sports betting industry will grow significantly over the next several years as more states authorize sports betting and as existing markets mature.
Share of Total Quarterly Sports Betting Handle by State (January 2023)
Source: EKG United States Sports Betting Market Monitor – Released February 2023
As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the three largest sports betting markets in the U.S. by handle were New York, New Jersey and Illinois. In states that permit online and retail sports betting, online sports betting handle is generally higher than retail handle; however, some states have legalized retail sports betting only (e.g., New Mexico and Arkansas) while other states have legalized restricted forms of online sports betting (e.g., in-person registration required in Nevada and for a period of time in Iowa, Illinois and Rhode Island). 
U.S. Online Gaming: Estimating the Total Addressable Industry Size
If every U.S. state was to legalize online casino, based on state level projections from EKG, it is projected that the U.S. market would generate approximately $48 billion in revenue. Similarly, if every U.S. state was to legalize online sports betting, based on state level projections from EKG, it is projected that the U.S. market would generate approximately $23 billion in revenue.
Latin America Gaming Industry
Latin America (including Mexico) is another area of focus for us. Since 2018, we have been operating online gaming in Colombia, which has a population of approximately 50 million, and since the second quarter of 2022, we have been operating in Mexico, which has a population of approximately 128 million. We believe this experience will enable us to expand further in Latin America and other countries when the opportunities arise. Online gaming is also authorized in certain jurisdictions within Argentina, Peru and Brazil, which have populations of approximately 46 million, 34 million and 216 million, respectively. Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Brazil still have relatively low internet penetration, with 72%, 87%, 71% and 81%, respectively, of the population having internet access compared to 91% in the United States and 95% in the UK. Further internet penetration in these Latin American countries would allow us to grow our revenues from online gaming there to the extent we make our offerings available in those countries.
The highest populated country in Latin America, Brazil, legalized sports betting in December 2018. Argentina and Peru, which are among the top five countries in Latin America measured by population, also legalized sports betting (only certain jurisdictions within Argentina) in April 2019 and July 2022, respectively.
We believe given our experience and success in neighboring Colombia and Mexico, we will be well-qualified to obtain the appropriate gaming licenses and operate in these jurisdictions in due time.
Canadian Gaming Industry
In April 2022, we were among the first group of operators to launch online gaming in Ontario, Canada, where we offer both online casino and online sports betting. Ontario has the highest population and gross domestic product of all the Canadian provinces. Based on results for the first three quarters of operations, the Ontario market is off to a strong start, with online casino and online sports betting revenue growing by more than 60% in the second full quarter and more than 70% in the third full quarter of operations. Based on the population of Ontario and the growth to date in that market, we expect that market to continue to grow in the future. 
The success to date in Ontario is also promising as it may cause other Canadian provinces to consider whether they should regulate online gaming and betting. With Ontario being home to approximately 14.2 million people, representing approximately 39% of the total population of Canada, the other Canadian provinces present a large potential growth opportunity. We believe that our experience and success in Ontario positions us well to expand further in other Canadian markets when deemed appropriate.
Competition
We operate in the global gaming and entertainment industry. Therefore, we generally view any type of discretionary leisure and entertainment provider as a competitor with respect to our customers’ time and share of wallet. Specifically, in the North American online casino and sports betting space (our primary market), our competitors come from two main groups – (i) established online-first companies and (ii) bricks-and-mortar casino and similar gaming establishments. Established online-first companies in the North America market include companies such as Flutter Entertainment / The Stars Group (through their FanDuel and FoxBet brands), DraftKings (including through their Golden Nugget Online Gaming brand), 888 (through its SI Sportsbook brand), Roar Digital (through its BetMGM brand and partnership with Entain plc), Bet365, Tipico, Betway and PointsBet, among others. Additionally, we face competition from North American casinos such as Penn National Gaming through its Barstool and theScore brands, Hard Rock through its Hard Rock Digital brand, Caesars Entertainment through its acquisition of William Hill, Bally Casino through its Bally Bet brand and Wynn Resorts through its WynnBET brand. In addition, Fanatics Inc. has publicly announced that it intends to enter the U.S. betting and gaming market as early as 2023.
We compete on a number of factors across our B2C offerings. These include, without limitation, our front-end online gaming platform, our back-end infrastructure, our ability to retain and monetize existing customers, re-engage prior customers and attract new customers, and our regulatory access, compliance and customer service experience.
In the B2B space, primarily in the retail sportsbook market, our competitors include, without limitation, SBTech (which was acquired by DraftKings), US Bookmaking, International Gaming Technology (IGT), Kambi, Playtech and Scientific Games. We compete primarily on the quality and breadth of our technology solutions and support services.
Intellectual Property
Our business relies significantly on the creation, authorship, development, use and protection of intellectual property. This intellectual property consists of, for example, software code, proprietary technology, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents, customer lists and databases and trade secrets that we use to develop and provide our offerings and related services, as well as online betting and gaming content (both proprietary and licensed) and proprietary data acquired from our customers’ use of our offerings and related services.
We own the copyrights in the software code we author. From time to time, we may seek patent protection covering inventions we conceive and pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions.
We rely on common law rights or contractual restrictions to protect certain of our intellectual property rights, and we control access to our software source code and other trade secrets by entering into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties that have access to our software source code, trade secrets or other intellectual property. From time to time, we may assert our rights in our intellectual property as appropriate or desirable against third parties who may be infringing such rights.
Some of the intellectual property we use is owned by affiliated entities or third parties, and we have entered into licenses and other agreements with the relevant parties to obtain rights to use such intellectual property. Although we believe we have sufficient rights under such agreements for the intended operation of our business, such agreements often restrict our use of the third parties’ intellectual property and limit such use to specific time periods, jurisdictions or purposes.
RSG, an affiliated entity, and its affiliates assigned to us several of the trademarks and domain names that we use in connection with our business, and we granted to RSG and its affiliates a perpetual, royalty-free license to use some of these trademarks and domain names in certain fields of use. This license may be either exclusive or non-exclusive based on the field of use and the particular trademark or domain name. This license precludes our use of certain trademarks and domain names in the exclusive fields of use.
We have a license agreement, as may be amended from time to time, with Rivers IP Holdings, LLC (“Rivers IP”), an affiliated entity, pursuant to which Rivers IP granted to us a fully paid-up, exclusive license for the use of the trademarks “Rivers,” and “BetRivers,” “Bet Rivers” used alone or in combination with other words, and domain names incorporating any of the foregoing trademarks, in each case in connection with real-money gaming and fantasy sports (subject to obtaining certain gaming approvals) and play-for-fun or free-to-play offerings (anywhere in the world). Either party may terminate this license by giving the other party 180 days’ written notice. This agreement provides us with a license to use the “Rivers,” “betrivers,” “betrivers.com” trademarks and domain names in jurisdictions in which RSG operates “Rivers” branded casinos. However, in those jurisdictions we received a sublicense from the applicable “Rivers” branded casinos to utilize such trademarks and domain names in connection with our operation of retail and online sports betting and online gaming under the casinos’ regulatory licenses. We also have similar license agreements, as may be amended from time to time, with Sugar House HSP Gaming, LP, pursuant to which we can use the “Sugarhouse” and “playsugarhouse” marks and related domains in the jurisdictions in which they are used.
Third parties in the sports betting, online gaming and casino, technology and other industries may own patents, copyrights and trademarks and may occasionally threaten litigation or file suit against us or our vendors or request us or our vendors to enter into license agreements, in each case based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Occasionally we and/or our vendors have received, and expect to receive in the future, third-party allegations or cease-and-desist letters, including from our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed such parties’ intellectual property rights, such as their trademarks, copyrights, and patents. Such allegations may increase as our business grows.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate in the gaming and entertainment industry, in particular in the online gaming industry. These industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted or enforced in ways that could negatively impact our business.
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we generally must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes or a percentage of revenue in each jurisdiction in which we operate and/or are licensed in order to continue our operations. Our business is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity, honesty and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in the gaming operations along with the integrity and security of the online casino and sports betting offerings. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.
Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect customers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state, provincial and/or other local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility. Among other things, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:
•ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;
•establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;
•establish and maintain anti-money laundering practices and procedures;
•establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures and systems for reliable record keeping;
•maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
•file periodic reports with gaming regulators;
•establish programs to promote responsible gaming; and
•enforce minimum age and as applicable, location, requirements.
Typically, the regulatory environments in U.S. states or other jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and underlying regulations and are administered by one or more regulatory agencies (typically a gaming commission or governmental lottery) that regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business:
•adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;
•interpret and enforce gaming laws and regulations;
•impose fines and penalties for violations;
•review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;
•grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;
•collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;
•review and approve certain transactions, which may include acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants and securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and
•establish and collect fees and taxes in jurisdictions where applicable.
While we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable sports betting and online casino laws, licenses and regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that our activities or the activities of our customers, partners or suppliers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement investigation, proceeding or other governmental action or that any such proceeding or action, as the case may be, would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
To operate in certain jurisdictions we must first obtain either a temporary or permanent license or determination of suitability from the responsible authorities. We seek to ensure that we obtain all necessary licenses to develop and put forth our offerings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and where our customers are located, as applicable.
Gaming laws generally require us, and each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our stockholders holding more than a specified percentage of our outstanding equity, or more of our outstanding equity, to obtain licenses from gaming authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Where not mandated by statute, rule or regulation, gaming authorities typically have broad discretion in determining who must apply for a license or finding of suitability and whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable to conduct operations within a given jurisdiction. When determining to grant a license to an applicant, gaming authorities generally consider: (i) the financial stability, good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility of the applicant (including verification of the applicant’s sources of funding); (ii) the quality and security of the applicant’s online real-money gaming platform, hardware and related software, including the platform’s ability to operate in compliance with local 
regulation, as applicable; (iii) the applicant’s history; (iv) the applicant’s ability to operate its gaming business in a socially responsible manner; and (v) in certain circumstances, the effect on competition.
Gaming authorities may, subject to certain administrative procedural requirements: (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, revoke or suspend any license issued by them; (ii) impose fines, either on a mandatory basis or as a consensual settlement of a regulatory action; (iii) demand that named individuals or stockholders be disassociated from a gaming business; and (iv) in serious cases, liaise with local prosecutors to pursue legal action, which may result in civil or criminal penalties.
Events that may trigger revocation of a gaming license or another form of sanction vary by jurisdiction. However, typical events include, among others: (i) conviction in any jurisdiction of certain persons with an interest in, or key personnel of, the licensee of an offense that is punishable by imprisonment or may otherwise cast doubt on such person’s integrity; (ii) failure without reasonable cause to comply with any material term or condition of a gaming license; (iii) declaration of, or otherwise engaging in, certain bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or discontinuance activities, or an order or application with respect to the same; (iv) obtaining a gaming license by a materially false or misleading representation or in some other improper way; (v) violation of applicable anti-money laundering or terrorist financing laws or regulations; (vi) failure to meet commitments to customers, including social responsibility and responsible gaming commitments; (vii) failure to pay in a timely manner all gaming or betting taxes or fees due; or (viii) determination by the gaming authority that there is another material and sufficient reason to revoke or impose another form of sanction upon the licensee.
As noted above, in addition to us and our subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, gaming authorities generally also have the right to investigate individuals or entities having a material relationship or material involvement with us or any of our subsidiaries, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable as a business associate. Specifically, as part of our obtaining sports betting and online casino licenses, certain of our officers, directors, employees, and in some cases, stockholders (typically, beneficial owners of 5% or more of a company’s outstanding equity, with most jurisdictions providing that “institutional investors” (as defined by a particular jurisdiction) can seek a waiver of these requirements) must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed or to qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Qualification and suitability determinations generally require the submission of extensive and detailed personal and financial disclosures followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes with respect to the individuals who hold licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities and in addition to the authority to deny an application for licensure, qualification or a finding of suitability, gaming authorities may disapprove a change in a corporate position. If any director, officer, employee or significant stockholder is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required, to sever our relationship with such person. Furthermore, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our “Charter”) provides that any equity interests of RSI owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates will be subject to mandatory sale and transfer to either RSI or one or more third party transferees and in such number and class(es)/series of equity interests as determined by our Charter in good faith (following consultation with reputable outside and independent gaming regulatory counsel) pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our Board of Directors (the “Board”).
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after a gaming authority advises that it is required may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action or our licenses may be in peril if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities.
Product-Specific Licensing
Online Casino
North America
We currently offer online casino in Michigan, New Jersey, Ontario (Canada), Pennsylvania and West Virginia, pursuant to licenses granted by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the 
Alcohol a Gaming Commission of Ontario (the “AGCO”), the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and the West Virginia Lottery.
Generally, online gambling in the United States is only lawful when specifically permitted under applicable state law. At the federal level, several laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations that violate underlying state gambling laws. These enforcement laws include the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (“UIGEA”), the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. In addition, the Wire Act of 1961 (as amended, the “Wire Act”) provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering who knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a state or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a state or foreign country in which such betting is legal. There was legal action as to whether the Wire Act applies beyond sports betting. A federal court of first instance has ruled that it does not and the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not appealed.
In Canada, all forms of gaming are generally prohibited by the Canadian federal criminal code. However, Canadian provincial governments may generally conduct and manage gaming within their own province, subject to certain limitations. In 2022, Ontario adopted standards and regulations applicable to online gaming activities in Ontario, and in conjunction with iGaming Ontario, a subsidiary of the AGCO, began conducting and managing online gaming within Ontario. It is within this framework that we received a license to operate our online casino offering within Ontario, Canada.
Latin America
We operate our online casino offering in Colombia under the RushBet brand via a web-based solution, pursuant to a concession contract with the Colombian gaming regulatory agency, Coljuegos Empresa Industrial Comercial Del Estado Administradora Del Monopolio Rentistico De Los Juegos De Suerte y Azar Linea Gratuita (the “Coljeugos”).
In Mexico, gaming is regulated at the federal level through the Mexican Ministry of the Interior, also known as the Secretaría de Gobernación (the “SEGOB”). The SEGOB issues permits to operators of gaming facilities but does not regulate suppliers or providers of online gaming services. Through a relationship with a local Mexican partner that holds a gaming permit, we, as a service provider for our partner, make our online casino offerings available under the RushBet brand in Mexico.
Sports Betting
North America
In North America we currently operate our online sports betting offering under the PlaySugarHouse brand in Connecticut and Pennsylvania and the BetRivers brand in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia pursuant to our licenses granted by the gaming commission of such states, specifically, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the Arizona Department of Gaming, the Colorado Division of Gaming, the Illinois Gaming Board, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, the Maryland State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the New York State Gaming Commission, the Ohio Casino Control Commission, the Virginia Lottery Board and the West Virginia Lottery. We also operate retail sportsbooks in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan (see “Native American Gaming Regulation”), New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia pursuant to applicable state and tribal licensing regimes.
On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion determining that PASPA was unconstitutional. PASPA prohibited a state from “authorizing by law” any form of sports betting. In striking down PASPA, the U.S. Supreme Court opened the potential for state-by-state authorization of sports betting. Numerous states and territories already have laws authorizing and regulating some form of sports betting online or in bricks-and-mortar establishments. Sports betting in the United States is subject to additional laws, rules and regulations at the state level. See “Risk Factors — Risk Related to 
Government Regulation — Our business is subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing. Any change in regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory climate applicable to our business and offerings, or changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretation thereof related to our business and offerings, could adversely impact our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”
Native American Gaming Regulation
Gaming on Native American lands is governed by federal law, tribal-state compacts and tribal gaming regulations. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (the “IGRA”) provides the framework for federal and state control over all gaming on Native American lands and is administered by the National Indian Gaming Commission and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The IGRA requires that a tribe and the state in which the tribe is located enter into a written agreement, a tribal-state compact, which governs the terms of the gaming activities. Tribal-state compacts vary from state-to-state and in many cases require vendors to meet ongoing registration and licensing requirements. In addition, many Native American tribes have established tribal gaming commissions to regulate gaming-related activity on tribal lands. Through our subsidiaries, we provide play-for-fun sports betting and online casino services on behalf of certain Native American tribes that have negotiated compacts with their respective states and have received federal approval. Currently, we are authorized as a vendor to provide online casino and online and retail sports betting services to the Little River Casino Resort, a wholly owned and operated enterprise of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, and we also provide social casino offerings to Coushatta Casino Resort, a gaming enterprise owned and operated by the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana.
Latin America
In Colombia, we operate our online sports betting offering under the RushBet brand via a web-based solution. We also operate 25 retail shops or sports bar locations where customers can use provided terminals to place bets and make deposits and withdrawals. We operate pursuant to a concession contract with the Colombian gaming regulatory agency, Coljuegos.
In Mexico, gaming (including sports betting) is regulated at the federal level through the SEGOB. The SEGOB issues permits to operators of gaming facilities but does not regulate suppliers or providers of online gaming services. Through a relationship with a local Mexican partner that holds a gaming permit, we, as a service provider for our partner, make our online sports betting offerings available under the RushBet brand in Mexico.
Data Protection and Privacy
In addition to our licensing regime for our offerings, we also take significant measures to protect our customers’ personal information and data.
We collect, use, store, receive, transmit, share or disclose, and otherwise process certain personal information of our customers, employees or job applicants, and third-party vendors and, thus, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data. Regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario), the Mexican Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data held by Private Parties, and Colombian Statutory Laws 1266 of 2008 and 1581 of 2012, as amended, and regulations in other jurisdictions where we do not operate but that could otherwise impact our operations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act, may be new or are relatively untested laws (some of which may not yet be effective) that could affect our business, and the potential impact is unknown. We also collect, use, store, receive, transmit, share or disclose, and otherwise process certain personal information of job applicants and employees in Estonia or the European Union (the “EU”), thus we are also subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) for such data.
Compliance
We have developed and implemented an internal compliance program designed to ensure that we comply with legal and regulatory requirements imposed on us in connection with our online casino and sports betting activities. Our internal compliance program focuses, among other things, on reducing and managing problematic gaming and providing tools to assist users in making educated choices related to gaming activities.
Additionally, we use various methods and tools across our operations such as geolocation blocking, which restricts access to wagering activities based on a user’s geographical location determined through a series of data points such as mobile devices and Wi-Fi networks; age verification to ensure our users are old enough to participate; routine monitoring of user activity; and risk-based user due diligence to ensure customer funds are legitimately derived. We have a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and collusion. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and have developed appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of the evolving regulatory regimes, we cannot provide assurance that our compliance program will prevent all violations of applicable laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or our personnel will not result in a monetary fine, suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses, or other governmental or regulatory action.
We have built our online platform to meet the needs of differing regulatory regimes, including configurable regulatory and responsible gaming controls such as responsible gaming tests, operator alerts on customer behavior, deposit limits, betting limits, loss limits, timeout facilities, session limits, reality checks, balance thresholds and intended gaming amounts. These features are intended to provide our customers full control of their gaming to allow them to play responsibly.
Responsible and Safer Gaming
We view the safety and welfare of our customers as critical to our business and have made corresponding investments in our processes and systems to help ensure their safety and welfare. We are committed to industry-leading responsible gaming practices and seek to provide our customers with the resources and services they need to play responsibly. These practices, resources and services include deposit limits, voluntary restrictions on access and use of certain offerings, temporary self-exclusion and cooling-off periods, voluntary permanent exclusion from our offerings and applications and data science technology, which helps us flag any suspicious, abnormal or problematic betting activity. We also generally participate in self-exclusion registers where they are in operation. We prominently promote our responsible gaming tools, resources and initiatives on our website and mobile applications. We also maintain a self-excluded customer list, which prohibits self-identified customers from placing bets or participating in real-money gaming and have embedded the software to limit or restrict the amount individual customers spend. In addition, we train our frontline personnel to identify signs of problematic gaming, ensuring that we are not only utilizing data and technology but also our human resources.
In May 2019, we joined the National Council on Problem Gambling (“NCPG”) as a Platinum Member. The NCPG is the leading national organization for people and their families who are affected by problem gambling and gambling addiction. Our NCPG membership supports wide-ranging problem gambling prevention, treatment, education and research programs, as well as innovative responsible gambling policies provided by the NCPG. Our membership helps build on NCPG efforts, including the Safer Sports Betting Initiative and Internet Responsible Gambling Standards, which assist operators like us by providing best practice responsible gambling policies and procedures for all online gambling activities, including sports betting. We are also members of the Sports Wagering Integrity Monitoring Association and the American Gaming Association. In March 2022, we became the first U.S.-based online casino and sports betting company to receive RG Check iGaming Accreditation from the Responsible Gambling Council for our BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com sites. RG Check is regarded as one of the world’s most comprehensive and rigorous responsible gaming accreditation program. In addition, in July 2022, we became the first U.S.-based online casino and sports betting company to partner with Neccton to adopt its player protection software for our North American BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse sites. This real-time data analysis player protection software will help us offer an added layer of player safety and sustainable play.
In 2022, we partnered with the AGA by participating in its “Have a Game Plan®” public service campaign, which brought together organizations across the gaming and sports industries to advance responsible sports wagering. As an official partner to the Chicago Bears, we leveraged our relationship to create a combined in-stadium message to raise awareness of our partnership with the AGA and show our support for the Have a Game Plan responsible gaming tools.
