Item 1.    Business
Our Company 
MultiPlan is a leading provider of data analytics and technology-enabled solutions designed to bring affordability, efficiency and fairness to the U.S. healthcare industry. We do so through services focused on reducing medical costs and improving billing and payment accuracy for the Payors of healthcare, which are primarily health insurers, self-insured employers, federal and state government-sponsored health plans and other health plan sponsors (typically through their health plan administrators), and, indirectly, the plan members who are the consumers of healthcare services.
MultiPlan was founded in 1980 as a New York-based hospital network and has evolved both organically and through acquisition into an integrated data and analytics platform offering a suite of services which efficiently address the cost of medical services.
Payors of healthcare have essentially three strategies for reducing medical cost: managing the utilization of medical services, lowering the per-unit cost of medical services incurred, and ensuring the services are reimbursed without error and accepted by the provider. MultiPlan services currently target the latter two of these approaches, as illustrated by the schematic below, which shows the value chain for healthcare services from care provision to payment.
Summary of the Healthcare Claim Lifecycle

Pre-Payment Services | Post-Payment Services

Dotted box = addressed by MultiPlan Solutions
MultiPlan sits at the nexus of four constituencies – Payors, employers/plan sponsors, plan members and providers – offering an independent reimbursement solution to reduce healthcare costs in a manner that is systematic, efficient and fair to all parties involved. Although the end beneficiary of our services are employers and other plan sponsors and their health plan members, our direct customers are typically health plan administrators who go to market with our services. Over the last 40+ years, we have developed a platform that offers these Payors a single interface to a comprehensive set of services, which are used in combination or individually to reduce the medical cost burden on their health plan customers and members while fostering independently developed fair and efficient reimbursements to healthcare providers. 
MultiPlan offers services to our customers in three categories:
•Analytics-Based Services: a suite of data-driven algorithms and insights that detect claims over-charges and either negotiate or recommend fair reimbursement for out-of-network medical costs using a variety of data sources and pricing algorithms. These services are applied prior to the payment of the claim and are often processed within a day of receipt;
•Network-Based Services: contracted discounts with healthcare providers to form one of the largest independent preferred provider organizations ("PPO") in the United States, as well as outsourced network development and/or management services. These services are applied prior to the payment of the claim and are typically processed within a day of receipt; and,
•Payment and Revenue Integrity Services: data, technology, and clinical expertise deployed to identify and remove improper and unnecessary charges before or after claims are paid, or to identify and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.
Our comprehensive service offerings are often utilized as a suite of solutions to manage medical costs and are often embedded into our customers' technology environments, enabling us to maintain long-term relationships with a number of our customers, including relationships of over 25 years with some of the nation's largest Payors. For the year ended December 31, 
2022, our services identified approximately $22.3 billion in potential medical cost savings. In addition, because in most instances the fee for our services is directly linked to the savings utilized by our customers, our revenue model is aligned with the interests of our customers.
Our Competitive Advantages
We believe MultiPlan is uniquely positioned by the competitive advantages we have cultivated and continue to develop. These advantages consist of a platform of differentiated resources that are difficult to replicate, as well as dynamic capabilities that enable us to quickly reconfigure our resources to address our customers’ evolving needs and to capture new opportunities in the market.
The unique resources on our platform include: 
•Proprietary data, deep domain expertise, and continuous customer engagement – We use the knowledge acquired from servicing 700+ Payors and data from over 40 years of processing claims to improve our service offerings and to customize those offerings to our customers’ individual needs and preferences. 
•Proprietary pricing methodologies –Our claim pricing methodologies, which in some cases are supported by a patented benchmarking process, produce high levels of provider acceptance based on their rigor, transparency, independence, and track record of producing fair and efficient reimbursements. 
•A nationwide network of over 1.3 million contracted providers – Our provider network was developed discretely over the course of 40+ years and is supported by our credentialing and data management expertise, sophisticated matching engine, and a network development team consisting of over 100 professionals. The breadth of our provider network enables us to offer extensive, flexible network configurations to our customers.
•A claims negotiation team consisting of over 400 experts who are supported by data and analytics tools and AI-driven workflows. 
Together with our unique resources, we have developed domain expertise, intellectual capital and processes that allow us to reconfigure, build, and integrate internal and external resources and competencies in response to changes in the markets in which we operate. Among others, these dynamic capabilities include new service and product development strategies, knowledge creation and retention strategies to turn new insights and learning into institutional knowledge, resource allocation strategies focused on the efficient distribution of our resources, and acquisition and alliance strategies that bring new resources and competencies into the Company from the external sources. Our set of dynamic capabilities enables us to modify our existing operational strategies and processes to be highly responsive to our evolving customer needs. We believe this flexibility is an essential feature of our customer value proposition and a durable source of competitive advantage. 
In addition to the unique resources and dynamic capabilities on our platform, we enjoy economies of scale that allow us to produce valuable services for our customers at lower unit costs than our competitors and to make significant investments in these services on behalf of our customers. In 2022, we processed over $155.2 billion in claim charges and identified over $22.3 billion in potential savings for customers. 
U.S. Healthcare Industry
The Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation Health System Tracker currently reports that an estimated $12,000 per person is spent on healthcare in the United States per year, representing the highest per capita healthcare spend among the world’s 11 highest income countries. At the same time, U.S. healthcare ranks last out of these 11 countries in terms of healthcare quality and efficacy. MultiPlan’s mission is to help address this internationally identified deficiency in the U.S. healthcare system with services that reduce healthcare costs while delivering fairness, efficiency and affordability.
According to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ("CMS"), Americans spent $4.3 trillion, or 18.3% of U.S. GDP, on healthcare in 2021 which equates to approximately $12,914 per person. Healthcare spending is projected to grow by 5.4% annually through 2028. CMS estimates that, at this rate, healthcare spend will represent $6.2 trillion by 2028. The Census Bureau reports that about 298 million people in the U.S. had health insurance coverage in 2020, of which 177 million were covered under employer-sponsored plans. CMS also cites that nearly 28 million people were enrolled in Medicare Advantage ("MA") plans in 2022, and another estimated 54 million were enrolled in managed Medicaid plans based on 2019 CMS figures.
Healthcare spending is a function of both utilization and cost. Many factors drive the expected growth in both. Long-term utilization is presently increasing due to a population that is both aging and experiencing more chronic disease. The advent of new treatments, modalities and technologies spur further utilization. Medical cost is increasing with increases in per-unit prices, 
driven in part by those same new treatments, modalities and technologies as well as the additional administrative burden of complying with new regulations. Costs also increase with the continued complexities of healthcare billing, which leads to unintended billing issues. As expenditures continue to rise, stakeholders – and especially Payors – are becoming increasingly focused on solutions that reduce medical costs and improve billing and payment accuracy.
An estimated $1.2 trillion, or about a third of U.S. healthcare expenditures, are attributed to some form of waste or abuse that leads to overcharges. MultiPlan’s services directly address the overcharges that accounts for about $400 billion of waste/abuse, including – excessive prices, clinical billing errors, suspect billing schemes and patterns, errors in enrollment data and, in some cases, services provided unnecessarily. 
We believe cost management and billing and payment accuracy will continue to be highly important to Payors across the markets we serve. We expect growth in demand for these services will be driven by two major trends: (i) increasing costs per claim from medical inflation and treatment, modalities, and technology enhancements and (ii) increasing treatment volume from an aging population and growth of the insured population in the U.S. As medical activity rises as a result of an aging population and a focus on preventative healthcare and technological advances, medical claims volume and costs are expected to increase significantly, which we believe will further increase utilization of our solutions. We see opportunity in countering the accelerating pace of medical cost inflation, leading to more savings for our customers and associated revenues for the Company. 
Of the $400 billion in estimated waste/abuse, we estimate the serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) for our out-of-network cost management and out of network payment integrity solutions is approximately $6 to 8 billion. We estimate the SAM for our in-network payment integrity solutions is approximately $4 to 5 billion. 
MultiPlan Services 
Analytics-Based Services.
Our Analytics-Based Services reduce the per-unit cost of claims using data-driven negotiation and/or reference-based pricing methodologies. These services often are used in a solution hierarchy after MultiPlan's network services to reduce claims with no available network contract, but are also used standalone. Value-Driven Health Plan services bundle network and reference-based pricing to enable a blended benefit plan design. All of the services in this category leverage our information technology platform, public data sources, and the billions of claims that we have reviewed and are included in our database reflecting both network and out-of-network priced claims, as well as the results of clinical coding analyses. They feature proprietary algorithms and machine learning/AI to allow claims to be processed quickly and accurately. 
Reference-Based Pricing ("RBP"). RBP provides Payors with a recommended payment amount for out-of-network claims based on a reference point. Most RBP programs in the market uses Medicare as the reference point. We also offer this option, but most customers elect to use our Data iSight program which uses facility cost as the facility reference point and median reimbursed amounts as the professional reference point. The facility pricing methodology features a patented benchmarking process that determines the cost of a group of like claims from like providers in the same geography. Both methodologies use data from readily-available public and private sources which feed our proprietary automated algorithms to deliver defensible, consistent pricing. RBP recommendations do not incorporate member protection from balance billing, so the service includes optional post-payment negotiation and patient advocacy services to negotiate settlements where needed to eliminate balance billing. Our cost-driven approach was developed with input from healthcare facilities, and was designed to address the typical issues providers have with reference-based pricing. As a result, we believe the propensity for providers to balance bill is materially lower than other similar services. Data iSight delivers provider acceptance of over 90% for facility and 96% for professional claims, and for those claims that are appealed, we successfully retain about 88% of savings through education and negotiation. We offer a number of additional choices of reference point, including: median contracted rates (adjusted to the Qualifying Payment Amount for certain surprise bill claims), and usual and customary charges. Our Reference-Based Pricing services are used by all types of Payors, most notably large commercial insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans. They are most commonly priced at a percentage of savings identified.
Value-Driven Health Plan Services ("VDHP"). VDHP is a form of reference-based pricing that bundles member and provider engagement tools to enable employers and other health plan sponsors to offer low-cost health plans. The engagement tools include member shopping based on quality, cost and provider acceptance of the reimbursement; provider education and, where applicable, negotiation in advance or after payment; point-of-service cash payment processing; and other features designed to ensure satisfaction of both members and providers while delivering significant cost reduction. These tools distinguish VDHPs from other plans using RBP because they deliver many of the benefits that plan members and providers expect with a PPO network, and therefore make it feasible to replace the network either in part or in full. Provider acceptance of the reference price is about 98%. Our VDHP service offerings enable a range of VDHP configurations, including a "standard" 
form of VDHP which integrates our PPO network for professional and select facility services; a "full" VDHP which has no network; and a community-based VDHP which features an agreement with a marquee health system in the area to accept the reference-based price in exchange for preferred steerage of the health plan’s members. VDHP services are sold to employers directly using the broker/consultant channel, or through Third-Party Administrators ("TPAs"). Today, they are most in demand in the small and mid-sized group market. They are most commonly priced per-employee/member-per-month ("PEPM").
Financial Negotiation. Our financial negotiation services assist Payors with pricing out-of-network claims from providers with whom neither the Payor nor MultiPlan have been able to secure a contractual discount. We handle these claims on an individual basis and attempt to negotiate with the provider an acceptable payment amount for a specific claim that includes member protections from balance billing. Negotiation agreements protect the health plan member from balance billing. Approximately half of the successfully negotiated claims are completed in a fully automated manner. These claims include those in which the proposed negotiated amount is generated by algorithms and automatically transmitted to the provider’s office, and/or that are electronically accepted and signed by the provider. Certain providers also choose to set up an arrangement with MultiPlan for pre-determined levels of discount to be automatically deducted on claims that would otherwise be individually negotiated. For those claims that are not automatically negotiated, MultiPlan works directly with the provider's office through our negotiations staff, which is aided by extensive workflow and benchmarking tools. Financial negotiation services are used by all types of Payors, most notably Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans. They are priced at a percentage of savings identified.
Surprise Billing Services. Introduced in 2021, our surprise billing services help Payors comply, or help their employer/plan sponsor customers comply, with the federal No Surprises Act ("NSA"), which became effective on January 1, 2022. Interim final regulations issued on July 13, 2021 and October 7, 2021 ("IFRs") and then final regulations issued on August 26, 2022 (the "Final Rules"), have provided additional detail on how payors and providers must operate under the NSA. These IFRs and Final Rules implemented portions of the NSA and introduced changes to the reimbursement process of certain types of medical claims, increasing what was typically a one- to two-step reimbursement process to five steps. MultiPlan performs all five steps in an end-to-end service, or makes each step available as components to meet the specific needs of each Payor. The steps require extensive data collection and analysis to identify claims as surprise bills under the law’s definition; calculate the new QPA introduced by the law and append it to the claim; create an initial payment amount for the claim, typically by using the QPA as the reference point; negotiate a settlement as needed; and take claims through an independent dispute resolution process as needed. In offering these new services, we leverage existing technology and expertise in data science, claim pricing, and negotiation. The services are used by all types of Payors that must comply with the NSA, and are priced either as a percentage of savings for the end-to-end service, or on a per-claim basis for individual components.
Network-Based Services
Our Network-Based Services reduce the per-unit cost of claims through contracts with providers and facilities that establish discounts with member protection from balance billing in exchange for patient steerage and other provider-friendly terms and conditions. These services generally are used first in a solution hierarchy with members actively steered to participating providers through online and other directories. The services leverage our extensive network development, credentialing and data management capabilities as well as a sophisticated transaction engine that matches rendering provider information on the claim to the applicable network contract so the discount can be applied. We offer a variety of network configurations to support all types and sizes of health plans, generally used as either the primary network, or as a complement to another primary network. 
Primary Networks. For Payors without their own direct contractual discount arrangements with providers, our primary networks serve as the network for the Payor’s commercial health plans in a given service area in exchange for a PEPM rate, or as the Payor’s out-of-area extended primary network in exchange for a percentage of the savings identified. Our national primary network, branded PHCS Network, has been continuously accredited for credentialing by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA") since 2001. We believe this provides assurances to employers/plan sponsors and plan members of the quality of providers in the network. Customers mainly include provider-sponsored and independent health plans; Taft-Hartley plans and TPAs, as it is more cost effective for these Payors to outsource this function than to incur the expense of developing and maintaining their own network of thousands of doctors and hospitals. 
Complementary Networks. Our complementary networks provide Payor customers with access to our national network of healthcare providers that offer discounts under the health plan’s out-of-network benefits, or otherwise can be accessed secondary to another network. Payors use the network to expand provider choice for consumers, and to achieve contracted price reductions with member protections on more claims. The service is priced based on a percentage of savings identified. Customers most commonly include large commercial insurers, property and casualty carriers via their bill review vendors, Taft-Hartley plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, and some TPAs.
Other Network Services. We also offer network build and network management services. Network build services comprise custom development of and/or access to primary network contracts, leveraging our extensive network development team and analytic tools, including a tool combining internal provider data with public sources to enable strategic targeting of providers to be contracted. Customers of this custom build/access service include MA and Medicaid health plans seeking assistance with expansion plans or help maintaining the required network adequacy. Network management services enable health plans to outsource key steps in their claim adjudication. We load proprietary or third-party network demographic and rate information and perform claim pricing as well as optional credentialing and data management services for claims associated to networks that aren’t owned by MultiPlan.
Payment and Revenue Integrity Services
Our Payment Integrity Services use data, technology and clinical expertise to assist Payors in identifying improper, unnecessary and excessive charges before or after claims are paid, as well as issues with premiums paid by CMS for government health plans caused by discrepancies with enrollment-related data. Payment Integrity Services can be used before payment, to correct overpayments before they are issued, or after payment to enable the recovery of overpaid dollars. Revenue Integrity Services identify and correct errors in plan enrollment data that lead to underpayment of CMS premium dollars. The services rely heavily on our internal and other data sources, advanced analysis, machine learning and transaction processing technology, as well as clinical expertise to aid in the identification and selection of issues to be addressed with the least provider abrasion.
Clinical Negotiation. This is a specialized pre-payment integrity service targeting claims not reduced through a commercial healthcare Payor’s primary network(s). Eligible claims are taken through payment integrity analytics and a scoring process to identify scenarios where a clinical discussion with the billing provider is warranted. Based on the resulting score, a claim reduction is negotiated with the provider based on clinical findings and a signed agreement is obtained. This service is most commonly used by large commercial Payors, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, and provider-sponsored and other independent health plans. Claims are priced based on a percentage of savings identified. Clinical Negotiation also is integrated into MultiPlan's network pricing so the majority of customers benefit from this pre-payment integrity service. 
Pre-Payment Clinical Reviews. Pre-payment claims utilize payment integrity analytics, which may include any of the following additional reviews: medical coder, clinician, medical record or itemized bill. Claims are returned with recommended corrections. The services target all claims, including a Payor’s in-network claims, and are most commonly used by large commercial and MA/Medicaid insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, and provider-sponsored and other independent health plans. Services are priced based on a percentage of savings identified, where savings is defined as the difference between the allowed amount established by pricing the claim through its normal process and the corrected allowed established based on items/services flagged for removal during the review. Some of the services also are integrated into MultiPlan's network pricing and analytics-based services so the majority of customers benefit from our pre-payment integrity clinical review services. 
Coordination of Benefits and Subrogation Services (pre- and post-payment). Coordination of Benefits identifies payments that should have been made by a health plan member's other health insurance coverage (for example, if the member's spouse has coverage through another employer-sponsored plan). Subrogation Services identify payments made related to an accident that are the responsibility of another responsible third party. The services use data, technology and highly experienced staff to identify cases, validate coverage status, report or recover dollars paid in error, and assist with root cause correction to avoid future potential overpayments. Subrogation services are also available in a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model. These services are used by commercial, MA and managed Medicaid Payors and depending on the service, are priced based on a percentage of savings identified and/or recovered, per member per year, or per member with primary coverage identified. 
Data Mining (post-payment). Data Mining deploys payment integrity analytics combining industry-accepted rules and plan-specific policies to identify overpayments associated with claim adjudication errors, billing errors and contract language, as well as their root causes. Findings are returned to the Payor for action. These services are used by commercial, MA, managed Medicaid and state Medicaid Payors and are priced based on a percentage of savings identified and/or recovered. 
Revenue Integrity Services. Targeting issues unique to MA Payors, these services use data, technology, and clinical expertise to identify and restore underpaid premiums, and to improve accuracy of future premiums paid to MA plans by CMS. There are three services currently offered, typically used in combination: Medicare Secondary Payor interfaces with CMS to confirm member eligibility records for primacy, correct inaccuracies, and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars; End Stage Renal Disease ("ESRD") analyzes claim data to identify MA plan members with missing ESRD statuses at CMS and works with dialysis providers and CMS to correct the statuses; and Part D Other Health Insurance ("OHI") leverages analytics to identify MA plan members where the Part D Pharmacy Coverage on file with CMS is inaccurate and effectuates corrections with CMS. The updated Part D information improves compliance, efficiencies and member satisfaction. These services are priced based on a percentage of the CMS premiums restored to the MA Payor. Part D OHI is priced per validated member with other primary Part D coverage.
Growth Strategy 
In meeting its mission to drive fairness, efficiency and affordability for U.S. healthcare, MultiPlan has historically focused on helping Payors manage medical spend by lowering per-unit claim costs and improving billing and payment accuracy. Our growth strategy seeks to amplify this value proposition, and expand beyond it, by leveraging our longstanding customer relationships and extensive proprietary data and algorithms. The strategy has three components: enhancing the performance of our existing service offerings, adding new services or evolving existing service feature/function to meet shifting market requirements, and expanding beyond our three existing service lines within our core and adjacent markets. 
We enhance existing service performance through technology, data and strategic changes aimed at delivering more value on the claim volume we already receive from existing customers. We have made and continue to make investments in combining proprietary data with third party data, and in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve service performance. A recent example of this facet of our strategy is our negotiation prioritization tool, an award-winning machine learning application for our Negotiation Services to improve prioritization based on likelihood of success and other factors, thereby improving both throughput and value. 
We routinely add services or evolve existing service features and functions within our core service offerings, with initiatives informed by continuously scanning the market and the unique insights our customers share into the market’s unmet needs and changing preferences. An example of this facet of our strategy was the introduction of the 2022 No Surprises Act compliance services combining our pricing and negotiation competencies with new data and logic assets and the addition of a new arbitration service in order to enable our customers to comply with sweeping new regulations. We are now in the process of introducing the next generation of these services, which uses data science to deepen customer value and competitive advantage for MultiPlan. We have also invested in sales resources to heighten cross-selling activity with existing customers, aided by our extensive ability to bundle discrete service offerings in unique ways.
Finally, we maintain our focus on introducing new services, either organically or via acquisition, that deliver different value propositions to our customers. Our recent focus in this area has been on growing our footprint with in-network commercial claims and MA claims, which significantly increases our total addressable market while leveraging our deep existing customer relationships and existing technology infrastructure. In addition to the 2014 introduction of pre-payment integrity services, recent examples of this strategy component include the acquisitions of HST in 2020 and Discovery Health Partners in 2021. HST added a new service line we call Value-Driven Health Plan Services, direct-to-employer services enabling a new type of benefit plan design with reference-based pricing at its core. Discovery Health Partners broadened our pre-payment integrity services to include both post-payment integrity and revenue integrity services. This latter acquisition had the additional benefit of increasing MultiPlan's penetration in the MA and managed Medicaid markets. 
Markets We Serve 
We work with healthcare Payors in the commercial healthcare, government healthcare and property and casualty markets. Substantially all of MultiPlan's services are available in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. All services are available to all applicable customers regardless of geographic location, company type or size.
Commercial Health
Commercial healthcare accounted for about 28% of the total $4.3 trillion U.S. medical spend in 2021. Commercial health plans are offered either as an insured program where the plan sponsor – typically an employer – and its members pay a monthly premium and the insurer pays the medical costs from those premium dollars, or as self-insured plans funded by the employer/plan sponsor and its members from a pool of funds earmarked for this purpose. Self-insured plans are typically administered by insurance companies or TPAs. Often, particularly for the national insurers, this "Administrative Services Only" ("ASO") business is larger than the at-risk insured business in terms of membership. In the year ended December 31, 2022, consistent with MultiPlan’s revenue mix, the four largest publicly-held commercial health insurers reported that approximately 80% of their membership was in self-insured plans. 
MultiPlan services benefit both fully-insured and self-insured health plans. We work with fully-insured plans directly, including national insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans. Because these entities are responsible for paying for medical claims, they are typically focused primarily on cost management and billing and payment accuracy with member features given less emphasis. These plans favor MultiPlan’s Analytics-Based Services, and in particular RBP, over Network-Based Services. We work with self-insured plans primarily through their plan administrators, which include the same types of companies as well as TPAs and sometimes the employers/plan sponsors themselves. Over 85% of our 2022 revenues are attributed to self-insured plans that we service through their Payors or directly. 
According to a Kaiser Family Foundation's Employer Health Benefits survey, annual healthcare premiums for family health coverage exceeded $22,463 in 2022, with employees paying over $6,000 toward their cost of care. Self-insured plan sponsors are responsible for paying medical claims as well as for the satisfaction of their plan members. In a tight employment market, particularly with large employers, choice of benefits and member satisfaction concerns may have equal or more weight than medical cost. This leads to the need for Payors to offer variety in plan designs, and according to Kaiser Family Foundation, over two-thirds of large employers offer at least two benefit plan options to their employees. Consequently, these plans often include Network-Based Services in their service hierarchies and/or use the "standard" VDHP services that integrate the professional PPO network in order to generate savings for both the plan and plan member. Larger Payors servicing self-insured plans also have extensive customized processing logic to support plan design variability as the labor market shifts, and one such customer has well over 100,000 such rules in place. 
The commercial health segment also includes individual health plans which are fully insured, and may or may not be sold through the Affordable Care Act exchanges. MultiPlan supports individual plans through the insurance companies offering these plans, and does not sell to the individual directly.
Government Programs
This market segment includes Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, Federal Employees Health Benefits, Veterans Administration and other federal health programs (state and municipal government health plans typically are managed as commercial plans). Commercial insurers and health plans also participate in this market segment, but there also are Payors that operate government plans exclusively. Most, but not all, of MultiPlan’s commercial healthcare services also are of value to Payors of government programs. 
Medicare Advantage plans serve the Medicare-eligible population in a private plan alternative to traditional Medicare. Kaiser Family Foundation reports that enrollment in MA plans more than doubled over the last decade. As of 2022, an estimated 28.4 million people were enrolled in MA plans compared to 26.0 million in 2021. MA Payors have a greater need for billing and payment accuracy than they do for cost management, because healthcare prices largely are set. With the growth this segment has and continues to see, there is heightened competition among Payors, which also drives the need for assistance in building network access. Today, these Payors use MultiPlan’s payment and revenue integrity services. They may also outsource some portion of their provider network development to MultiPlan.
Medicaid and Managed Medicaid. An estimated 83.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid and 7.1 million were enrolled in CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) plans as of August 2022. This reflects growth of approximately 8.0% and 1.1%, respectively, over August 2021 figures. As of 2020, 84% of Medicaid enrollees were in a managed Medicaid program. Enrollment has been growing as a result of the Medicaid expansion allowed under the Affordable Care Act. To date, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded or have committed to expand their Medicaid programs. The most recent growth is likely attributable to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act ("FFCRA"), which created a temporary increase in the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ("FMAP"). As with MA, MultiPlan’s services in this segment are primarily limited to payment integrity services with some custom network development of use to bidders winning state Medicaid business under a request for proposal ("RFP"). 
Other Programs. We have a history of developing custom networks for TRICARE and Veterans Administration programs. These are RFP driven, and MultiPlan partners with one or more Payors bidding on the business.
Property and Casualty
This market segment includes Payors of the medical services arising from work-related injuries and auto accidents, as well as other types of property and casualty insurance. There is little overlap between the commercial and government Payors and those in this segment. The insurers are often serviced by third parties that perform bill review services that include access to provider networks. We typically work with these service providers versus the carriers directly.
Workers' Compensation. Workers' compensation insurers must pay both the indemnity costs and the medical costs associated with an injured worker. Recent trends in medical cost inflation have become a major driver in the overall cost growth for workers' compensation insurers. As of 2020, medical services accounted for about 60% of workers' compensation claims costs compared to 40% in the early 1980s. Rising medical costs have increased focus on cost management measures for the medical portion of workers' compensation insurance claims. We provide network access and pre-payment integrity services to these Payors. Our analytics-based services are used to a lesser extent, primarily because the majority of states have established provider reimbursement fee schedules, in the absence of a network contract that provides other benefits to the Payor.
Auto Medical. Auto insurance carriers face costs from auto damage and medical claims. Economic losses for bodily injury liability claims increased 10% annually from 2012 – 2017, well above the 3% annual medical inflation rate, with medical expenses accounting for 79% of claimed losses. With ongoing medical cost inflation, this trend is expected to continue into the 
future. MultiPlan’s value in this segment is similar to the Workers’ Comp segment – network access and payment integrity services primarily, with some interest in analytics-based services where state fee schedules are not in place. 
Customers
MultiPlan works directly with over 700 Payors to manage medical cost and billing and payment accuracy for their Administrative Services Only ("ASO"), self-insured employers/plan sponsors and fully-insured health plans where applicable. We also indirectly service consumers accessing healthcare services through commercial and government health plans or property and casualty policies. In aggregate, we serve a diverse customer base comprised of national and regional insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, TPAs, self-insured health plans, property and casualty insurers, bill review companies and other companies involved in the claim adjudication process. Through our HST subsidiary we also work with employers directly and through their brokers/consultants.
We believe we have strong relationships with our customers, which include substantially all of the largest health plans and their ASO platforms. Contract terms with larger customers are often three years and as many as five years, while mid- to small-sized customer contracts are often annual and typically include automatic one-year renewals. We continue to experience high renewal rates and our top ten customers based on full year 2022 revenues have been customers for an average of 25 years. Our customer relationships are further strengthened by high switching costs as MultiPlan is electronically integrated with its customers in their time-sensitive claims processing functions, and we support highly flexible benefits offerings to an extensive group of customers who often feature a MultiPlan logo on membership cards when our networks are used. 
We estimate that in 2022 our Payor customers served over 100,000 employers/plan sponsors actively using our services through the ASO distribution channels, which generated over 85% of our combined Network and Analytics revenues in 2022. Through these plan sponsors, an estimated 60 million consumers have access to our services through their health plans. Our three largest Payor customers accounted for approximately 32%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The loss of the business of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, at the plan sponsor level, our revenues are dispersed across a broad array of employers/plan sponsors and revenue concentration is significantly lower. Within the ASO channel, the top 10 self-insured plan sponsors represent less than 10% of our combined Analytics and Network revenues in 2022.

We believe we have largest independent provider network outside of the top national Payors, with over 1.3 million healthcare providers as of December 31, 2022. The breadth of our provider network enables us to offer extensive, flexible network configurations to our customers, which we believe is a competitive advantage. Our team of approximately 100 network development professionals manages these network relationships across our Primary and Complementary PPO Networks. For existing providers, the goal of the network development team is to strengthen our existing provider relationships, help providers maintain participation across products and increase the discounts the providers extend to our customers that utilize our provider networks.
In addition, the network development team is responsible for executing new contracts with providers that are not currently affiliated with our networks, either on behalf of our own network or on behalf of a Payor that seeks to outsource its network contracting function. The network development team manages a sophisticated program of data mining, profiling, recruiting and ultimately contracting with new providers to increase the value provided to customers. An incentive driven pay-for-performance plan measures and rewards the success of our network development team.
Sales and Marketing
Our largest customers are serviced by a team of national account managers and senior executives responsible for continued growth of the relationship. The account team partners strategically with our customers, leveraging our Healthcare Economics unit to mine the customer's data and proactively present opportunities to the customer to improve performance and competitive position. This team also delivers account service, including daily claims management, RFPs, service inquiries and other marketing and operational support functions. The national account managers are compensated with a base salary plus bonus linked to customer retention.
The majority of our customers are serviced by a dedicated team of account managers and account service professionals organized into three market-focused departments — Health Plans (commercial and government), TPA/Employer, and Property and Casualty. These teams also include sales professionals responsible for new customer acquisition. The market-focused account managers are responsible for relationship management as well as for growing revenue through expanded use of services. They are compensated with a base salary plus a bonus and commission based on customer retention and revenue from upselling new products. The sales professionals are compensated with a base salary plus commission based on revenue from 
new customers. Sales and upselling efforts are supported by a marketing team which generates leads, builds brand awareness, implements and educates customers and develops proposals.
Information Technology
Our IT platform provides a substantial competitive advantage. We have made significant investments in upgrading our IT infrastructure enabling us to automatically process significantly more transactions with greater accuracy and greatly improving our capacity to continuously serve our customers. Our IT is certified under HITRUST and AICPA SOC programs and we are consistently rated at the top of our peer group by BitSight, an IT security rating organization. Our proprietary network repricing application is capable of returning approximately 99% of repriced claims to our Payor customers on the same day. In 2022, our prepayment Payment Integrity and reference-based pricing services returned 99% and 97%, respectively, of claims within one day. Our proprietary negotiation application features portal technology with electronic signature acceptance, sophisticated claim distribution and prioritization algorithms enhanced with machine learning. We have implemented connectivity via EDI or direct integration using web services with all of our top customers. During 2022, the majority of claims processed in our system were received via EDI or direct web service integration, with some claims now being received via FHIR API. As we process more claims through EDI, direct web service integration, and APIs, our substantial back office interconnectivity significantly reduces complexity and the number of processing errors. Because our IT platform is scalable, it is generally able to absorb substantial increases in volume at minimal marginal costs.
In addition to its high levels of security and throughput, our IT platform is enhanced with access to hundreds of terabytes of structured and unstructured data across dozens of public and proprietary data sources. This comprehensive data landscape allows us to best address the needs of our customers and has both facilitated and is continually enhanced by the approximately 20 million claims we process every month. As of November 2022, the Company had the capacity to increase processing capacity by more than double with the current infrastructure. Also in 2022 we invested in data science, expanding the internal team.
Our Competitors 
We compete with other companies in our markets on the basis of the effectiveness of our cost saving solutions, the quality of our customer service, and the prices of our services. We believe no single competitor currently offers the same breadth of services we provide. The breadth of our services exposes us to a broad range of competitors as described below. Any businesses we acquire in the future may introduce us to additional competitors. Our competitors vary by service, as follows:
Analytics-Based Services. MultiPlan competes with a variety of medical cost management companies for negotiation, reference-based pricing and surprise billing services. We compete for these services on the basis of savings effectiveness, provider acceptance, and plan member satisfaction. Our workflow and claim processing technology, user interaction and data and analytic tools are key competitive advantages. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically are reference-based pricing services. They can be classified as programs intended to partially or fully replace networks, such as 6Degrees, AMPS, ELAP Services and Payer Compass, and those primarily accessed behind a full network, such as Zelis, ClearHealth Strategies and Naviguard.
Network-Based Services. We compete directly with other independent PPO networks, which are primarily regional, and with PPO network aggregators on the basis of network discounts, access, quality and price. PPO aggregators offer national access by patching together third-party networks, in some cases including MultiPlan's network. While aggregators rely on third-party networks, MultiPlan's network features direct contracts with 98% of its participating providers. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically include First Health, TRPN, and Zelis. We also compete with PPO networks owned by our large Payor customers, primarily on the basis of independence and flexibility. Our nationwide Primary PPO Network has held NCQA accreditation since 2001, which we believe provides assurances to Payors and consumers regarding the quality of the providers in our network.
Payment and Revenue Integrity Services. We compete with a variety of larger and smaller vendors of payment and revenue integrity services. Our Payment Integrity services compete on the basis of analytic breadth and depth, human expertise and scope. Virtually all payment integrity competitors originated as post-payment specialists and to varying degrees have migrated services to a pre-payment modality, while our services were built to focus on examining claims before payment occurs and now, with the 2021 acquisition of DHP, we have a broader capability to address post-payment integrity. Our Revenue Integrity services compete on the basis of identification of and assistance in restoration and preservation of underpaid premiums from CMS caused by member eligibility and status errors. Our competitors for these services typically include Optum, Conduent, Cotiviti, Inc., SCIO and The Rawlings Group. 
Government Regulations 
We believe that each of MultiPlan's service offerings bears less regulatory risk than other healthcare businesses that bear insurance risk and bill federal healthcare programs or directly provide care. While we support customers that are regulated entities, we generally are not directly regulated and face significantly lower levels of regulatory complexity. We function as a transaction processor and we believe we have limited risk for services or billing.
MultiPlan does not deliver healthcare services; provide or manage healthcare services; or provide care or care management. Our business is compensated directly by private Payor customers, not by Medicare, Medicaid or other government healthcare programs. In some instances, we provide services to Payors that contract directly with a federal or state agency. In those instances, we may be subject to certain federal and state law requirements associated with those programs as a First Tier, Downstream or Related entity (FDR). As an FDR to these customers, we are subject to requirements which prohibit an individual or entity who has been convicted of program-related crimes or other violations from providing services to, or receiving payment from, government healthcare programs. As an FDR, we are subject to affirmative legal obligations, as well as contractual requirements with our customers, to check the exclusion status of the individuals and entities we employ against lists of excluded individuals and entities prior to entering into employment or contractual relationships with them, and to periodically re-check such lists thereafter, or run the risk of liability under civil monetary penalties laws or a breach of our contractual obligations. We are also required to provide access to contracts, books and records pertaining to services performed in connection with federal or state agency contracts. A failure to comply with FDR requirements or violations of healthcare laws could subject us to audits, corrective actions, contract terminations, criminal or civil penalties, and/or debarment or exclusion from government healthcare programs.
However, through our customer relationships, we are subject either directly or indirectly to federal and state laws and regulations that govern privacy, security and breaches of patient information and the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions. These transactions, include, for example, HIPAA, which imposes rules protecting individually identifiable health information and setting national standards for the security of electronic PHI. We are a "Business Associate" (as defined by HIPAA) of our customers. As such, we must comply with all applicable provisions of HIPAA, including the HIPAA Security Rule and applicable provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Breach Notification Rule. Violations of such provisions may result in civil monetary penalties, resolution agreements, monitoring agreements, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Although HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue in civil court for violations, the laws and regulations have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of patient information. In addition to HIPAA, there are federal and state laws that protect types of personal information that may be viewed as particularly sensitive, including substance abuse information, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, and mental health information. The Federal Trade Commission has also interpreted existing consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, storage, processing, use, retention, disclosure, transfer, disposal, and security of information about individuals, including health-related information. State privacy laws are changing rapidly. Massachusetts and New York, for example, have enacted regulations and statutes that require any entity that holds, transmits or collects certain personal information about their residents to adopt a written data security plan that meets the requirements set forth in the statute. In California, the CCPA, as amended by CPRA, provides California residents with a number of privacy-related rights and is more stringent in many respects than other state laws currently in effect in the United States. Further, each year a number of proposals related to data privacy or security are considered before federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, including in a number of states considering consumer protection laws similar to those in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia. These laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and may also be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities.
In addition, we are subject to certain state licensure and/or certification laws and other state and federal laws and regulations governing our operations and our products. Among other examples, contracts governing our relationships with healthcare providers may be subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claims Act and comparable state laws, as well as state laws prohibiting fee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine and state and federal laws regarding transparency. The federal False Claims Act, for example, prohibits knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The law contains whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals (known as relators) to sue on behalf of the federal government for conduct that defrauded the federal government. The government has used the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as billing for services not provided, coding errors, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. In addition, the government or a relator may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. States have similar false claims act laws. Failure to comply with such laws can result in civil or criminal liability such as penalties, fines, and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Furthermore, we may be subject to some 
state laws regulating the ability of PPOs to allow broad access to their provider networks. We may directly or indirectly be subject to state and federal regulation regarding the payment of out-of-network claims, including regulations regarding the determination of payment amounts and what data and other factors are permitted to be used by commercial health Payors and other Payors in making such determinations, as well as regulations targeting surprise billing and requiring transparency. 
For example, effective January 1, 2022, the NSA prohibits certain out-of-network providers from charging patients an amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for services rendered, subject to limited exceptions. For services for which balance billing is prohibited, the NSA establishes an independent dispute resolution ("IDR") process for providers and Payors to handle payment disputes that cannot be resolved through direct negotiation. The law is being implemented through the IFRs and Final Rules, as well as other guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other governmental entities. We expect additional guidance and regulations that may change our understanding of the obligations of our customers under the NSA; the current administration has indicated they will release additional proposed rules in 2023. Additionally, there are a handful of lawsuits challenging portions of the NSA in federal courts. The Texas Medical Association, an industry group for physicians, and LifeNet, an air ambulance provider, have each brought three lawsuits, and the Texas Medical Association has brought an additional fourth lawsuit, all challenging aspects of the regulations published to date. The outcome of the first set of lawsuits from both plaintiffs changed the way the IDR process works with respect to the QPA value (median contract rate). The second set of lawsuits from both plaintiffs challenged the updated version of QPA usage in IDR that was published in the Final Rules. In February 2023, the court agreed with the plaintiffs in this second set of lawsuits and vacated certain sections of the Final Rules, thereby putting the QPA on even standing with additional factors in the IDR process. This court ruling is subject to appeal. The two final lawsuits challenge aspects of how the July 2021 IFR requires plans to calculate QPA, the IDR batching rules established in the October 2021 IFR, and the increase in certain IDR fees for 2023 announced in December 2022 guidance; these have yet to be ruled on by the court.
In addition to enacting the NSA, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) also revised and clarified requirements of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Act (“MHPAEA”). The MHPAEA, enacted in 2008, prohibits health plans from providing less favorable mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits than medical/surgical benefits, whether measured in terms of quantitative treatment limitations or non-quantitative limitations (“NQTLs”). Specifically, the MHPAEA prohibits imposing NQTLs on mental health or substance abuse disorder benefits without performing comparative analyses on what impact those NQTLs will have. Plans are required to provide these comparative analyses to the Department of Labor upon request, and the Department of Labor is required to review at least 20 health plans for mental health parity each year. In 2021, the Department of Labor reviewed over 100 plans, and determined that none of the comparative analyses were sufficient as initially submitted. To support our customers, MultiPlan has initiated an annual process to review the prior year and create comparative analyses for aspects of our services related to network participation, credentialing, and other processes to enable customers to complete their own analyses. Additionally, states have begun to impose or update their own mental health parity initiatives, some of which require heightened annual reporting.
We may directly or indirectly be subject to regulation in some states governing the submission of true and accurate claims, or regarding the application of payment integrity edits to claims, including regulations impacting what data and other factors are permitted to be used by commercial health Payors and other Payors in making such determinations. Our services may directly or indirectly be subject to state regulations specifically covering certain categories of customers, such as workers compensation insurers and auto medical insurers. We regularly monitor legislative and regulatory activity in all states and at the federal level that could impact any of the products we offer in all relevant market segments. In addition, we are committed to supporting our customers in meeting their regulatory obligations, so we work cooperatively with them in establishing processes and procedures that comply with applicable requirements.
While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations and we will undertake efforts to comply with new laws and regulations, once effective, a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our contractual relationships and possibly expose us to civil or criminal sanctions by federal or state authorities. Please see the section entitled "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations."
Human Capital 
Our employees are our most critical assets. Our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, deliver high quality customer service, drive operational excellence and deliver strong financial performance is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our team. The long-term success and continued growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, reward, retain, and develop diverse, talented, and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We employed approximately 2,500 people as of December 31, 2022, substantially all of whom are full time employees and none of whom are covered by unions. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. 
The following are some of the significant investments we make in our employees and their development:
Compensation and Benefits. We offer competitive pay, and a robust benefits package, including healthcare benefits, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability plans, a generous Paid Time Off (PTO) policy, and a 401(k) Plan with employer match. We also offer voluntary wellness programs which can result in reduced benefit premiums, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance programs, voluntary benefits programs (including home & auto insurance, pet insurance, legal services, etc.), summer/winter hours, flexible work schedules and 'work zones' (meeting-free time blocks), and employee referral programs. 
In addition, the MultiPlan Scholarship program is offered to children of MultiPlan employees who wish to continue their education after high school to achieve their educational goals. The total amount of new scholarship awards granted in 2022 was $100,000. 
Through our MultiPlan Helping Hands program, we are able to provide financial assistance for employees experiencing hardship; the program is funded 100% from employee donations and is administered by the Helping Hands Committee, comprised of MultiPlan employees.
MultiPlan also operates a PTO Donation Program, which enables employees to donate their accrued paid time off to a general pool to be used by fellow colleagues who are experiencing a financial hardship due to a medical emergency or due to a major disaster (as declared by the President of the United States), and who have exhausted all paid leave available to them.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in addition to the MultiPlan Helping Hands Program and the PTO Donation Program discussed above, MultiPlan established the One MultiPlan Fund, which was funded in part by employee donations. The One MultiPlan Fund provides direct assistance to employees facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the decline in severity of COVID-19 cases as well as the resulting reduction in the number of requests under the One MultiPlan Fund, we discontinued the program on July 29, 2022. Since its inception, the One MultiPlan Fund helped over 60 employees and provided nearly $80,000 in financial assistance.
Health and Safety. The physical and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical and mental well-being for all of our employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, we responded quickly by enabling our teams to work remotely to ensure the health and safety of our employees, while continuing to provide uninterrupted service to our customers. We implemented a COVID-19 global task force to prioritize our pandemic response, and, in 2021, we began a phased re-opening plan, implementing a number of safety and social distancing measures in our sites to protect the health and safety of our employees who chose to return during the initial phases. With the identification of the Delta and Omicron variants, our re-opening plans slowed. However, in the second quarter of 2022, our re-opening plans accelerated and we were able to re-open all offices, although we still maintain a flexible posture as it relates to working remotely, which we believe greatly benefits our employees. Additionally, we continue to support access to COVID-19 vaccines for our employees, including by providing additional time off to facilitate employees’ ability to receive their vaccinations. We continue to provide healthy tips communications and information to our employees through an internal Coronavirus Information Center, all with the goal of keeping our employees and communities healthy, safe and informed. In addition to healthy tips communications, we provide a Virtual Working Resource center where employees can find support for working at home to support healthy lifestyles while facing various work at home challenges. 
External Recognition. We are proud to report that in August 2022, we were designated as a Great Place to Work-CertifiedTM company for 2022-2023. This distinction is based entirely on what our employees said about their experiences working at MultiPlan and MultiPlan’s philosophy for operating with trust, transparency, and integrity at every level of the organization. MultiPlan credits this achievement to its core values and the employees who support them daily. The Great Place to Work CertificationTM is the global benchmark for identifying workplace satisfaction, and is sought after worldwide with more than 10,000 companies across 60 countries applying each year.
Diversity Inclusion and Belonging. We strive to create a workplace that fosters mutual respect and collaboration, where talented individuals from all backgrounds, perspectives and abilities can participate and perform their best work. In 2020, we formed a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging ("DIB") Advisory Committee to establish, oversee and advance MultiPlan's DIB program objectives. The committee seeks to champion and foster organizational changes with a dedicated focus on DIB priorities, to facilitate the integration of the DIB program with our corporate objectives and values, to create accountability for program results and to engage and communicate with the MultiPlan community on all DIB efforts.
In 2021 and 2022, employees completed surveys providing insight on individual perceptions of our commitment and performance on DIB, with the results shared with all employees. This data is reviewed and used as a baseline for improvement by the DIB Advisory Committee. MultiPlan encourages every employee to contribute towards the DIB objectives through expanding their diversity knowledge and creating a more inclusive, equitable work experience. As part of the annual training initiatives, MultiPlan believes education is essential to achieving the DIB objectives. Employees are granted five hours each year dedicated to DIB education including a baseline course provided by the Company to establish a foundation of expectations. The remaining time is self-directed and self-reported determined by individual educational needs and interests. DIB educational resources are also curated by a diverse team of MultiPlan employees and peer recommendations are promoted routinely. In addition, employees were invited to publicly pledge support to MultiPlan’s efforts to positively impact its employees and local communities, and to foster a culture of mutual respect for individuals from all backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities. 
 MultiPlan Charitable Giving Committees are locally based near MultiPlan’s offices and support local and national communities through employee fundraising and volunteer efforts targeting underserved and underprivileged populations. 
MultiPlan partners with Circa, formerly America's Job Exchange, in the recruiting process, to ensure job postings are distributed to diversity websites to expand visibility to individuals seeking employment opportunities from a wide variety of backgrounds. We also partner with local CareerOneStop services for outreach.
In 2022, as part of the survey conducted as part of our designation as a Great Place to Work-CertifiedTM company, 94% of our employees said that MultiPlan is committed to diversity and inclusion and that people of all cultures, abilities, and backgrounds are respected and valued at MultiPlan.
Learning and Development. We believe that education is essential to MultiPlan employees’ professional growth and our organization's success. To support this belief, MultiPlan has invested in several learning and development opportunities developed and/or offered through the Corporate Education and Development department. Starting with onboarding to role based training, there are several programs to support employee growth and development beyond any compliance related training. Employees have an opportunity to work with their manager to custom build a development plan based on business and individual growth needs. Professional and leadership development is supported in partnership with vendors providing university and college certificate courses. Technical and other specialty training is provided through external resources sourced and supported at the business department levels. Customized programs have also been established to support development beyond training including the Technical Leadership Program, MultiPlan’s Academy Program for high potentials and performers and a mentoring program. In 2022, employees completed approximately 35,000 hours of training with satisfaction, applicability and increased knowledge rating scores between 4.4-4.6 out of 5.
Internal Recognition and Performance Acknowledgments. We also believe that it is important to foster recognition for employee’s contributions and progress. MultiPlan has created MultiSTAR, a MultiPlan Service Talent Achievement & Reward program that gives employees formal and informal opportunities to acknowledge employees for their many contributions, great work and to recognize their professional accomplishments. Through a multi-tiered award system, employees can celebrate anniversaries, share thank you notes on a public or private feed as well as recommend monetary awards based on different levels of significant accomplishment. 
Performance Management Program. MultiPlan has established a set of core competencies for all employees to navigate a successful career at the Company. Annually, leaders work together with employees to establish goals and development plans that give employees a clear direction for progress. 
Corporate History and Background
Our Company was founded in 1980 as a New York-based hospital network and has evolved both organically and through acquisitions from that regional network to a leading independent national PPO player, and then to a data- and technology-driven provider of cost management, payment and revenue integrity services company. Other notable acquisitions, in addition to the acquisitions of HST and Discovery Health Partners in 2020 and 2021, respectively, were BCE Emergis Corporation, in 2004, which extended network access nationally and added a negotiation services platform; Private Healthcare Systems, Inc., in 2006, which added a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-accredited, national primary PPO network; Viant Holdings, Inc., in 2010, which added analytics-based services and additional network access including for MA and Medicaid plans; National Care Network, LLC, in 2011, which added the Data iSight pricing service; and Medical Audit and Review Solutions, Inc., in 2014, which added pre-payment integrity services. 
Churchill Capital Corp III (formerly known as Butler Acquisition Corp), was incorporated in Delaware on October 30, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
On July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and MultiPlan Parent. On October 8, 2020, the Merger was consummated and the Transactions were completed. In connection with the Transactions, Churchill changed its name to MultiPlan Corporation and The New York Stock Exchange ticker symbols for its Class A common stock and warrants to "MPLN" and "MPLN.WS", respectively.
The Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Churchill was treated as the "acquired" company for financial reporting purposes with MultiPlan Parent determined to be the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on the existing MultiPlan Parent stockholders being the majority stockholders and holding majority voting power in the combined company, MultiPlan Parent's senior management comprising the majority of the senior management of the combined company, and the ongoing operations of MultiPlan Parent comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Transactions were treated as the equivalent of MultiPlan Parent issuing shares for the net assets of Churchill, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Churchill were recognized at fair value (which were consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangibles recorded. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information on the Transactions.
