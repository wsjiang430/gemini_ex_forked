Item 1. Business
Our Company
SmileDirectClub was founded on one simple belief: everyone deserves a smile they love.
We are an oral care company and the creator of the first medtech platform for teeth straightening. Through our cutting-edge teledentistry technology and vertically integrated model, we are revolutionizing the oral care industry, from clear aligner therapy to our affordable, premium oral care product line.
Our clear aligner treatment addresses the large and underserved global orthodontics market. We are a leading player in this massive opportunity, and we believe that our aligner treatment can help over 90% of people with mild to moderate malocclusion achieve a better smile.
Our vertically integrated model enables us to solve critical problems around cost, convenience, and access to care. We offer professional-level service and high-quality clear aligners generally at a cost of $2,050, up to 60% less than traditional orthodontic solutions. We achieve these cost savings while maintaining high quality by removing the overhead cost of multiple in-person doctor visits and managing the entire customer experience, all the way from marketing to aligner manufacturing, fulfillment, treatment by a customer’s dentist or orthodontist, and facilitating remote clinical monitoring through completion of treatment, which is facilitated by our proprietary teledentistry platform. These efficiencies enable us to pass the cost savings directly to our customers and allow the dentists and orthodontists in our network to focus on what matters most: providing convenient access to excellent clinical care. To further democratize access to care, we offer customers the option of paying the entire cost of their treatment upfront or enrolling in our financing program, SmilePay, a convenient monthly payment plan. We also accept insurance and as of December 31, 2022, are in-network with UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Anthem, Dominion National, Empire Blue Cross and MetLife, among others.
Our customer journey starts with any of several convenient options: a customer visits an office within our expanding collaborative model with the dentists and orthodontists in our existing network of affiliated dentists (“Partner Network”); books an appointment to receive a free, in-person 3D oral image of their teeth taken at any of our permanent SmileShops or popup locations across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., and Ireland; visits our website and requests an easy-to-use, doctor-prescribed impression kit, which is shipped directly to the customer’s home; or downloads the SmileDirectClub app to take an AI-driven 3D image of their teeth through which a customized treatment plan is created in minutes, now available in Australia and soon in other locations where SmileDirectClub operates. Using the image or impression, along with the other information collected from the customer, we create a preliminary custom treatment plan that demonstrates how the customer’s teeth will move during treatment. Next, through our telehealth platform, an appropriately licensed doctor within our network reviews the information collected from the customer, and determines if the customer is appropriate for treatment and if so finalizes and approves the customer’s treatment plan. If the customer is a good candidate for clear aligners and they decide to purchase, the licensed dentist or orthodontist issues the prescription for treatment and the manufacturing of the aligners. We then manufacture and ship the aligners directly to the customer. Through our telehealth platform, the treating doctor monitors the customer’s progress, requests additional information and/or clearances from the customer, and communicates seamlessly with the customer over the course of treatment. We also offer a suite of complementary oral care products, such as whitening kits, toothbrushes, toothpaste, a water flosser, SmileSpa and a variety of other oral care products to maintain a perfect smile.
More About Our Customer Journey 
Through our customer-centric platform, we have disrupted the traditional orthodontics industry, and in the process have helped over 1,900,000 customers and growing. Our proprietary technology and platform give customers the ability to receive clinically safe and effective treatment but without the 3-times markup of our primary competitor.
Customers start their journey by visiting our website or downloading our mobile app, where they can learn about how our process works, read first-hand reviews from other customers, and view before and after photos. Customers then proceed with their journey through one of the following convenient options:
•In person at a Partner Network location: A customer visits a dentist office or books an appointment online to take a free, in-person 3D oral image of their teeth at one of 900+ Partner Network locations.
•In person at a SmileShop: A customer can use our website to easily book an appointment to take a free, in-person 3D oral image at any of our popup locations or permanent SmileShops across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., and Ireland. At the 30-minute appointment, one of our team members (“SmileGuides”) uses a handheld oral camera that takes approximately 6,000 photos per second to create a highly detailed digital map of the customer’s smile.
•Remotely with our mobile app: A customer may download our mobile app to take a 3D image of their teeth which is uploaded to our proprietary AI platform to generate a preliminary treatment plan and demonstrate how the customer’s teeth may move and the length of time the treatment plan will take. The customer may then purchase their aligners, and visit a SmileShop for a final 3D scan or receive a doctor-prescribed impression kit shipped to their home, which is then returned to our facility for a final scan.
•Remotely with an impression kit: A customer may request an easy-to-use doctor prescribed impression kit online, which we ship directly to the customer pursuant to the prescription of a licensed doctor. Our impression kits are simple to use and can typically be completed by a customer within 30 minutes. The customer then returns their completed impression in a prepaid shipping box so that the impression can be scanned and digitized by our dental lab.
Once completed, the image or impression is used to create a digital map of the customer’s mouth, which our trained technicians use to create a draft custom treatment plan that contains the clinical protocols for how the customer’s teeth will move during treatment. The treatment plan is then sent to an appropriately licensed doctor in our network. Within 48 hours, the doctor reviews the treatment plan, together with the customer’s oral photos, dental and health history, and chief complaint, and, where appropriate, approves the customer’s clinical information and treatment plan and prescribes custom-made clear aligners. The appropriately licensed dentist may also request additional information before making any determination where required by international or state law or otherwise desired by the dentist, or reject the customer for treatment using our teledentistry platform.
At this point in the journey, we offer our customers two payment options to purchase the prescribed aligners: pay the full cost of treatment upfront or enroll in a convenient monthly payment plan that provides a flexible payment option to make our clear aligner treatment even more accessible (“SmilePay”). With a $250 down payment and an average monthly payment of only $89, SmilePay provides a more affordable option for those who cannot make the $2,050 full payment upfront.
Following a purchase, we manufacture and ship the full set of custom-made clear aligners directly to the customer. The average treatment lasts approximately six months. Once a customer begins treatment, the customer is required to upload photos and other information to our platform at least every 60 days for their treating doctor to review and order any touch-up aligners, as needed. In addition, we offer 24/7 access to care via our mobile app, website, chat, phone or email, and customers may request to connect with their treating doctor at any point in the journey and a video chat, phone or email touch base will be arranged. 
As a testament to our confidence in the quality and efficacy of our product, we offer a Lifetime Smile Guarantee. Our Lifetime Smile Guarantee ensures a full refund if a customer is not satisfied for any reason within the first 30 days and a pro-rated refund, or additional aligners at no cost for further adjustment, if the customer is not satisfied at any point later in the process. As long as our customers are compliant with treatment protocols, we will guarantee their smile for life. We also offer a suite of complementary oral care products, such as whitening kits, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and other ancillary oral care products to maintain a perfect smile.
Throughout our customer journey, we are singularly focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience. We manage every customer touchpoint and communication, enabling us to continually refine and optimize the customer experience.
Our Strengths
We believe our strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our position as a leading clear aligner provider. Below is a summary of our key strengths:
Mission-driven brand with a positive customer experience
Our mission is to democratize access to a smile each and every person loves, and we strive to create the best possible experience doing so. Our commitment to a superior customer experience has produced an average net promoter score of 55 since inception. More than 66% of our customers surveyed are promoters of our SmileShop experience to friends and approximately 20% of our customers today come through referrals. We believe we enjoy the largest reach and presence on social media relative to our competitors, with over 665,000 likes on Facebook and over 478,000 followers on Instagram as of December 31, 2022. Clear aligners are a highly considered purchase, and our scale and customer satisfaction are important criteria that will enable us to maintain our position as the leading clear aligner provider.
Omni-channel presence with a large SmileShop and Partner Network footprint
With multiple options for customers to start their journey, we empower customers to choose how they would like to interact with us. If a customer chooses to order a doctor-prescribed impression kit, we will ship one directly to the customer. Alternatively, we have a network of over 125 SmileShops in the locations we operate, as well as partnerships with over 1,000 dental practices in our Partner Network across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., France and Ireland, which provide an in-person experience to customers who prefer that channel. 
Our SmileShop locations give our customers more convenient ways to access care. Furthermore, our SmileShops and Partner Network locations require little capital investment, with minimal upfront capital expenditure.
Exclusive licensed doctor network across all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., France and Ireland
We have a network of over 200 orthodontists and general dentists across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., France and Ireland, who are fully licensed across these jurisdictions to meet regulatory requirements, and we continue to successfully expand our doctor network to support our growth. In addition, we believe our domestic doctor network is sufficient to support our growth. The doctors in our network evaluate whether customers are viable candidates for clear aligner therapy and if they move forward with treatment, they are responsible for evaluating our customers’ progress throughout treatment and are available to answer any questions should customers need additional assistance.
SmilePay captive financing increases accessibility and reduces purchasing friction
SmilePay is a key element to democratizing access to care and removing price as a limiting factor for our customers. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 60% of our customers have elected to purchase our clear aligners using SmilePay, which does not require a credit check. With SmilePay, a $250 down payment is required up front, which covers the cost of manufacturing the aligners. The remaining cost is financed over 26 months at an average monthly cost of $89 per month. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we offered SmilePay at an APR of approximately 21% and 20%, respectively, which had an associated delinquency rate of approximately 11% and 9% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe SmilePay, as a captive offering, reduces purchasing friction by removing the complex third-party financing process, resulting in higher conversion and a better overall customer experience.
Vertical integration powered by our proprietary teledentistry platform allows us to optimize every step of the customer journey
We are the first clear aligner company to build a scalable, integrated technology platform and doctor network for teledentistry. We manage the entire end-to-end process in a customer’s journey, from the moment a customer visits the website or mobile app; all the way through aligner manufacturing, fulfillment, and treatment monitoring by a customer’s doctor through completion of his or her treatment. Our proprietary platform supports rapid and efficient communication between our customers and their treating doctors, and the clinical and customer care teams.
Managing the customer journey from start to finish provides us with a comprehensive understanding of our customers and enables us to provide personalized, data-driven insights. It also enables us to quickly test and pilot new solutions and rapidly implement changes to our platform in order to deliver the best outcome for our customers and our business.
Our expertise in leveraging data and process engineering allows us to continually evolve how we interact with our customers.
Our Growth Strategy
Our mission is to provide everyone with a smile they love. We accomplish this by democratizing access to more affordable and convenient orthodontic care. We believe there is significant opportunity to further grow our customer base. We have helped over 1,900,000 customers out of a worldwide opportunity of approximately 500 million customers. We plan to grow by continuing to pursue the following key growth strategies:
Increase demand and conversion
Given that we have captured less than 1% of the total market opportunity, we plan to grow our customer base by continuing to focus our marketing efforts on the approximately 85% of people globally who have malocclusion. 
Our process engineering expertise, along with our meticulous attention to each step of the customer experience, enables us to continually improve conversion at each of the hundreds of touchpoints throughout the customer journey. We have been able to accomplish these improvements in conversion through our customer relationship management (“CRM”) strategies, educational efforts, technology advancements, and data-driven insights.
We see significant opportunity to continue increasing overall demand for our products and improving conversion at every touchpoint across our customer acquisition funnel.
Successfully target higher income customers
There are approximately 20 million annual world-wide case starts for traditional clear aligners and wires and brackets. We estimate that the average cost for these traditional cases is between $6,000 to $8,000, or approximately three times our offering at approximately $2,050. Given our relative price positioning in the market, we believe our growth has largely come from expanding the market by making teeth straightening more accessible to non-traditional, lower income consumers that would not typically be able to afford the $6,000 to $8,000 price of traditional teeth straightening offerings. We believe the higher income traditional consumer makes greater than $125,000 per year and presents a significant growth opportunity for us by successfully gaining share from traditional suppliers in the space. 
Higher income consumers purchasing for teens represents the largest market opportunity for our brand. Teens are approximately 75% of case starts annually, but currently make up only approximately 7% of SmileDirectClub customers. 
Creation of new aligner products and technology
In 2020, we launched our innovative Nighttime Clear Aligner product into the U.S. market and our international markets. 
This proprietary new product, which requires only 10 hours of nightly wear, enables us to expand our market to customers who are unwilling or unable to wear aligners for the 22-hour daily wear cycle typically required with traditional clear aligner therapy. 
In 2021, we launched our Comfort Sense technology featuring our patented laser technology that precision-cuts our aligners for a smoother fit, which, combined with the variable thicknesses of the aligners and doctor-prescribed and monitored treatment plans that start with lighter movements to ease customers into treatment, all results with a more comfortable fit and treatment for our customers. We also launched our new treatment planning system, SmileOS, in 2021. This next generation proprietary treatment planning software enables our network of appropriately licensed doctors to treat more patients, more accurately predict tooth movements, and better visualize their patients’ treatments. 
In 2023, we will launch our CarePlus aligner offering, which utilizes our growing Partner Network to offer customers the opportunity to begin their journey in the dentist’s chair and continue their treatment through our teledentistry platform or have the opportunity to interact in person with their treating dentist when needed. The product is designed with the higher income customer and teen market in mind, delivering a hybrid approach to remote and in-person care at an affordable price and with a higher touch concierge-level of professional support than our traditional aligners. The CarePlus offering will be priced at $3,900 with a pilot program launching in the first quarter of 2023 and an anticipated further rollout in the second half of 2023. 
This year will also see the global rollout of our innovative AI-driven SmileMaker Platform, which uses mobile technology to create an initial 3D image of the teeth and treatment plan, giving customers an instant preview of their aligner journey and treatment length, and condensing the path to purchase. This technology may be used for further applications to enable more precise monitoring of the teeth straightening process in the near future, driving the potential to deliver more precise tooth movement through more real time monitoring of the process as well as increased wear compliance and decreased need for mid-course corrections or refinements. 
Expand reach through growth in the Professional Channel
In response to market demand and requests by dentists and orthodontists, we have focused and grown our collaborative model with the dentists and orthodontists in our existing network of affiliated dentists (“Partner Network”). The collaborative model enables patients who wish to start their customer journey in a regular dentist office to do just that.  Their regular dentist’s office will collect the same patient information that our SmileShops and popup locations collect for subsequent review and assessment by one of the dentists or orthodontists in our affiliated network. We currently have more than 1,000 affiliated dental practices in our Partner Network. 
The Partner Network model not only expands on our commitment to customer convenience by allowing us to meet customers through the channel that makes sense for them but also allows us to improve our credibility with higher income customers. Higher income customers are more likely to seek a reference from a dental professional before deciding on a teeth straightening provider. Partner Network puts us directly in front of dental professionals allowing us to effectively educate and build credibility in the dental community, which deepens our foundation for future growth by improving our chances for success with higher income customers.
Retail partnerships and adjacent product expansions
Our business model introduces us to customers with a lifetime need for oral care. After treatment, our customers have a smile they are proud of and intent on maintaining. Because teeth are often prone to revert back to pre-treatment positioning, we offer our customers retainer options. In addition, customers after treatment are more interested in overall oral care and looking for products such as whitening and cleaning that help them protect the investment they made in their smile through treatment. These highly complementary offerings allow us to build a recurring revenue stream that furthers the investments we are making in our customers on the front end by expanding their lifetime value to us as a customer. 
Oral care is a highly competitive space, so we remain focused on developing our brand of innovative products to drive 
awareness, trial and repeat purchases through a diverse portfolio of differentiated oral care products. For instance, we have developed products to further penetrate the oral care market such as retainers, toothbrushes, toothpaste, water flosser, SmileSpa, lip balm, MoveMints, BrightOn premium whitening, and an LED accelerator light to address our customers’ oral care needs, along with many other oral care products. We believe that our growing suite of products will lengthen our relationship with our customers and enhance our recurring stream of revenue. 
In February 2022, we launched our Sensitivity Whitening Kit, broadening our award-winning whitening portfolio by introducing a product designed for those with sensitive teeth. In 2022, we announced the launch of our Fast-Dissolving Whitening Strips. Our whitening strips compete directly with the largest platform in the whitening category. In addition, we launched the first-to-market Stain Barrier pen that is a proactive treatment to help shield against staining beverages such as coffee, tea, and wine. These launches effectively further the brand’s reputation as an innovative oral care provider with products that are designed to meet the customer’s needs. 

As our brand continues to grow through innovative new product launches, we anticipate the customer relationships we have developed through oral care will transfer over to teeth straightening when the customer is ready to start their journey.
Leverage data science and technology
With over 1,900,000 customers helped to date, we have one of the largest repositories of data in the oral care sector. Using this data and artificial intelligence, along with other technologies, we believe we can enhance our existing offerings, improve our manufacturing, and produce new products. We will leverage this same information and technology to enhance our products and to develop and introduce new products.
Expand Business Partnerships
We are party to standard in-network insurance coverage agreements with UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Anthem, Dominion National, Empire Blue Cross and MetLife, among others, to include coverage for our aligners on an in-network basis, which means our customers who participate in these plans can obtain treatment at a lower out-of-pocket cost, after insurance coverage and negotiated discounts, and do not need to retroactively submit for reimbursement. These agreements have decreased the upfront cost to our customers and further streamline the complete revenue cycle management process, from eligibility check to payment posting. We are currently negotiating with other large insurance companies for similar arrangements. In addition, we are currently negotiating other business partnerships, such as corporate SmileDays and corporate discount programs, among others.
Sales and Marketing
Our management team has substantial experience successfully marketing direct-to-consumer brands. We market our aligners and other products through an omni-channel approach supported by media mix modeling (“MMM”). Our marketing approach focuses on both offline activities such as television and online digital marketing as well as campaigns directly targeted at the higher income customer market. 
Treatment Plan Design and Aligner Manufacturing
We produce customized aligners based on a doctor’s review of a customer’s dental and health history, chief concern, photographs, and a 3D image of the customer’s mouth resulting from receiving a digital scan or physical impression. To produce the customized aligners, we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies, including complex software solutions, laser, destructive and white light scanning techniques, stereolithography, 3D printing, and thermoforming. Our manufacturing is performed by Access Dental Lab, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary.
Treatment plan design
Customers have the option of booking an appointment to take a free, in-person 3D oral image at any of our Partner Network locations, SmileShops or popup locations, where one of our SmileGuides uses a handheld oral camera that takes approximately 6,000 photos per second to create a highly detailed digital map of the customer’s smile, or requesting one of our easy-to-use impression kits online and returning their completed impression to our manufacturing facility, or visit a dentist participating in our collaborative model network to obtain a free, 3D oral scan or have physical impressions taken. Our trained technicians then use the image or impression to create a draft custom treatment plan that contains the clinical protocols for how the customer’s teeth will move during treatment. The rules that govern the clinical protocols are contained within our proprietary software that is specifically designed for our aligners. Lastly, prior to a locally licensed dentist in our network reviewing the case, all treatment plans go through a quality review with our doctors in Costa Rica.
Initial treatment plan design is conducted primarily at our facilities in San Jose, Costa Rica. Costa Rica’s status as one of the Americas’ leading nations for dental education and expertise enables us to recruit and employ highly qualified personnel in our treatment plan setup facilities. 
After the treatment plan has been designed, a dentist or orthodontist licensed in the customer’s state, or appropriate international jurisdiction, as the case may be, reviews the customer’s oral photos, dental and health history, chief concern, treatment plan, and, when required or deemed appropriate by the treating doctor, x-rays or other bone imaging suitable for orthodontia, to make an independent initial determination of the customer’s suitability for clear aligner treatment. The treating doctor can then approve the treatment plan and prescribe the customer’s clear aligners, request additional information from the customer or clearances from the customer’s dentist prior to making a determination on treatment, decline the customer as a candidate for clear aligners, typically due to an oral health concern or the complexity of the case, or return it to the treatment plan setup team for specified adjustments prior to final approval.
Lastly, we have an extensive team responsible for reviewing every aligner that is manufactured prior to shipping and maintaining compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and other applicable regulations to help ensure a high level of quality in our final product.
Aligner manufacturing
Our aligners are manufactured at our facilities in Antioch, Tennessee, where we employ approximately 400 team members. Every order is custom made, and we believe the complexity inherent in producing our highly customized aligners in large volumes is a barrier to potential competitors. We continue to make significant advances in manufacturing automation to improve quality and reduce cost, and we expect to automate additional manufacturing functions in the future.
We have agreements with the suppliers of the raw materials needed to manufacture our aligners and for the putty used in our at-home impression kits. We also rely on a third party to assemble and distribute our at-home impression kits. There are alternative suppliers available for all raw materials we require and our supply agreements specifically provide for our ability to purchase from these alternate sources if our preferred suppliers are not capable of meeting demand. We also have the ability to secure additional manufacturing from other sources, if required.
Doctor Network
We have a proprietary network of more than 200 appropriately licensed orthodontists and general dentists across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., France and Ireland. We recruit doctors with the appropriate licenses across jurisdictions to meet regulatory requirements and continue to expand our network to support our growth. In addition to being in good standing in the jurisdictions where each doctor is licensed to practice dentistry, doctors in our network must have at least 4 years’ experience in treating patients with clear aligner therapy in a traditional bricks and mortar setting. Doctors in our network review customer records, evaluate candidacy for treatment, review, refine and approve treatment plans, prescribe clear aligners, communicate with customers, review case progress, order any necessary treatment plan modifications, and are 
available to answer any questions should customers need additional assistance. As we expand, we will expand our doctor network with appropriately licensed professionals. 
Comprehensive Customer Care
We provide comprehensive 24/7 customer care to our customers through a variety of communication channels, including our website, video, phone, chat, email and social media as well as self-guided resources such as knowledge-based and how-to videos and articles on our website. We have a dedicated team of approximately 300 customer care team members in Nashville and Costa Rica, including general customer care team members, an advanced customer care team to address more complex questions, and a clinical customer care team of certified dental professionals available to answer clinical questions. In addition, each customer’s treating doctor is available to answer clinical questions as needed or when requested by the customer or the treating doctor.
We believe that providing timely, responsive support and educational content to our customers helps foster an ongoing engagement that builds loyalty to our brand and also enables us to understand customer needs as they evolve. Our customer community serves as an efficient and engaging platform through which we can deliver customer care and receive feedback from customers. We gather and analyze user feedback from all platforms to help inform our design and engineering teams on future enhancements to our products and services. As our customer base grows in new geographies, we will continue to focus on building a scalable support infrastructure that enables our customers to engage with us through the channel that is most convenient and efficient for their needs.
SmileCheck
Our customer data is stored in our SmileCheck platform, a proprietary data repository for medical records, business transactions, and customer communications. SmileCheck supports rapid uniform access to, and use of, customer information across any internet-connected device.
From a customer’s standpoint, SmileCheck powers a user-friendly online portal that allows for easy remote access to treatment plan information, SmilePay account details and communications on a convenient, integrated platform that can be accessed whenever and wherever customers choose. SmileCheck facilitates real-time, remote sharing of treatment data between our customers and their treating doctors, thus avoiding inconvenient, in-person doctor visits. In lieu of in-person visits, customers are required to upload dental photos to SmileCheck at least every 60 days, in addition to other information, so that their treating doctor may review their progress.
Our doctor network also uses SmileCheck for case assignment and management. Our software automatically connects each customer’s case to a doctor licensed in that customer’s state, or appropriate international jurisdiction, as the case may be. Once a case is accepted by the appropriate doctor, that doctor is able to study the customers’ records, request additional information and/or clearances, review, refine, and approve treatment plans, prescribe clear aligners, communicate with customers, assess case progress and order any necessary treatment plan modifications, all via SmileCheck.
Research and Development
We have a research and development team with medical device development, dental/orthodontic, data science and other innovation focused backgrounds. Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on new product development for orthodontic and ancillary oral care products as well as data science and manufacturing automation.
Intellectual Property
We have more than 40 issued U.S. patents, and numerous pending U.S. and global patent applications. These patents and applications cover critical aspects of our process, including impression kit design, the SmileShop process, our Partner Network model, other systems, methods, and devices that facilitate the capture of customer images and data, certain key 
aspects of SmileOS, manufacturing automation and process, and our SmileCheck software, and they also cover our innovative oral care product offerings. Our issued U.S. patents expire from 2037 to 2041.
We have more than 50 issued U.S. trademark registrations, and 13 pending U.S. trademark applications. We also own over 300 issued foreign trademark registrations and over 100 additional foreign trademark applications currently pending in various jurisdictions worldwide. Collectively, our global trademark filings cover our SMILE DIRECT CLUB® house marks for use in connection with a wide variety of goods and services related to our business, as well secondary marks and slogans.
We continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications, trademark applications, and non-disclosure and non-compete agreements. We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or may issue in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products. Information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
Our business does not experience material seasonality fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flow needs throughout the year. However, we do increase our marketing spend at certain periods of the year, such as the first quarter of the calendar year, when customers typically have a higher focus on aesthetics, and we experience corresponding increases in website traffic and SmileShop bookings as a result of these increased marketing efforts. 
Competition
We compete with a handful of smaller companies that collectively have limited market share in the clear aligner industry. With the introduction of our collaborative and wholesale partner network, we also compete with more well-established companies in the traditional orthodontic industry such as Align Technology, Inc. We believe that the principal competitive factors and what makes us stand out in the market for orthodontic appliances include:
•Credibility: Each individual treatment plan is prescribed, directed, and managed by an appropriately licensed doctor who we require to have a minimum of four years of experience in clear aligner therapy in a traditional setting.
•Certainty: Delivering a new smile in as little as four to six months protected by our Lifetime Smile Guarantee.
•Comfort: Our aligners are made using Comfort Sense TM technology, which utilizes soft, medium, and firm plastics to safely and gradually shift your teeth.
•Convenience: Offering a 22-hour daily wear aligner or our Nighttime Clear Aligner treatment plan to fit our customers’ lifestyle with multiple ways to get started - at a SmileShop or popup location, with a Partner Network dentist or from home with our mobile app or a doctor-prescribed impression kit.
•Cost: Offering the smile of your dreams without the 3 times the markup with an easy one-time payment or convenient monthly payments.
We believe that these differentiating factors allows us to compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. 
Regulatory Matters
Our aligners, retainers, impression kits and some of our oral care products are considered medical devices and, accordingly, are subject to rigorous regulation by government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we sell our products. Compliance with these rigorous regulations will affect capital expenditures, earnings and the competitive position 
of the Company. These regulations vary from country to country but cover, among other things, the following activities with respect to medical devices:
•design, development and manufacturing;
•testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
•product storage and safety;
•marketing, sales and distribution;
•pre-market clearance and approval;
•record keeping procedures;
•advertising and promotion;
•recalls and field safety corrective actions;
•post-market surveillance;
•post-market approval studies; and
•product import and export.
FDA regulation
In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern the processes by which medical devices are developed, manufactured, brought to market and marketed. These include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations issued by the FDA, among others. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification (“510(k) clearance”), granting of a de novo request, or approval of an application for premarket approval (“PMA’’). In general, under the FD&C Act, medical devices are classified in one of three classes on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. A medical device’s classification determines the level of FDA review and approval to which the device is subject before it can be marketed to consumers:
•Class I devices, the lowest-risk FDA device classification, include devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s medical device general controls, including labeling, establishment registration, device product listing, adverse event reporting, and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through FDA’s Quality System Regulations.
•Class II devices, moderate-risk devices, also require compliance with general controls and in some cases, special controls as deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls may include performance standards, particular labeling requirements, or post-market surveillance obligations. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, typically a Class II device also requires pre-market review and 510(k) clearance as well as adherence to the Quality System Regulations/good manufacturing practices for devices.
•Class III devices, high-risk devices that are often implantable or life-sustaining, also require compliance with the medical device general controls and Quality System Regulations, and generally must be approved by FDA before entering the market through a PMA application. Approved PMAs can include post-approval conditions and post-
market surveillance requirements, analogous to some of the special controls that may be imposed on Class II devices.
Our manufacturing quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System Regulations enforced by FDA and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities. FDA’s Quality System Regulations require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures.
Our retainers and majority of oral care products are Class I devices, which may be marketed in the U.S. without premarket clearance or approval by FDA and are subject to general controls, including labeling, establishment registration, and adherence to good manufacturing practices through FDA’s Quality System Regulations.
We market our clear aligner products in the U.S. pursuant to 510(k) clearance as they are a Class II medical device. The manufacture, marketing and distribution of our aligners and other medical device products are subject to continuing regulation and enforcement by FDA and other government authorities, which includes routine FDA inspections of our facilities to determine compliance with facility registration requirements, product listing requirements, medical device reporting regulations, and Quality System Regulations, among others. If FDA finds that we have failed to comply with Quality System Regulations or other legal or regulatory requirements, it or other government agencies may institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us, ranging from Warning Letters to more severe sanctions, including but not limited to financial penalties, withdrawal of 510(k) clearances already granted, and criminal prosecution. We continue to hold our International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 and Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) certifications, with Canada, United States, and Australia within the scope of our MDSAP certification. 
The 510(k) process
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or another commercially available device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device.
Post-market regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and extensive regulatory requirements may continue to apply. These include but are not limited to:
•annual and updated establishment registration and device listing with FDA;
•Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers to follow stringent quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of a device;
•labeling, advertising, promotion, and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to legally marketed devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal, and recall reporting regulations, and FDA’s recall authority;
•complying with the federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers on devices; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention, or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
•criminal prosecution.
International regulation
The Canadian Food and Drugs Act, and the Medical Device Regulations issued thereunder, provide for regulation by Health Canada of the manufacture, labeling, packaging, distribution, sale, and advertisement of medical devices. Our aligners are regulated as a Class II medical device under the Canadian Medical Device Regulations, which require, among other things, that Class II medical device manufacturers selling medical devices hold a medical device establishment license and file various reports. We received our Canadian ISO/MDSAP certification in March 2019. In light of our ISO/MDSAP certification, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable Canadian regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of Health Canada or other currently applicable regulatory requirements. Under Canadian regulation, manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with device safety and effectiveness requirements as required by the Medical Devices Regulations and Health Canada. To that end, we have implemented controls and procedures intended to ensure that our Access Dental Lab Quality System meets FDA’s and Health Canada’s requirements. We continue to hold our ISO 13485 and MDSAP certifications, with Canada, United States, and Australia within the scope of our MDSAP certification. 
There is currently no premarket government review of medical devices in the European Economic Area (“EEA’’). However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
In the U.K. and EEA, our aligners and retainers are considered Class I custom made medical devices and are not required to have a Conformité Européene (“CE”) mark certification acknowledging conformity with health and safety protection standards for sales of those products into the U.K. and the EEA. We have a CE mark for sales of our impression kits into the U.K. and EEA.
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the E.U. Medical Device Directive and became effective on May 26, 2021. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. It is possible under the new Medical Devices Regulation that our aligners could be deemed mass-produced rather than custom-made devices in which event we would need to apply for a CE mark for our aligners. Once applicable, the new regulations will, among other things:
•strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
•establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market;
•improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals, and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the E.U.; and
•strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
In Australia, our retainers and aligners are considered custom-made medical devices and are exempt from inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (‘‘ARTG”), although we have submitted our notification to be listed on the ARTG, so that we have the right to ship those products into Australia and New Zealand. Impression kits are considered Class I devices in Australia and New Zealand, and we are registered and listed with these countries to ship impression kits to our customers there.
Quality System Regulations
Our manufacturing quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System Regulations enforced by FDA and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities. FDA’s Quality System Regulations require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. If 
FDA finds that we have failed to comply with Quality System Regulations or other legal or regulatory requirements, it or other government agencies may institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us, ranging from Warning Letters to more severe sanctions, including but not limited to financial penalties, withdrawal of 510(k) clearances already granted, and criminal prosecution. In addition, under Canadian regulation, manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with device safety and effectiveness requirements as required by the Medical Devices Regulations and Health Canada. To that end, we have implemented controls and procedures intended to ensure that our Access Dental Lab Quality System meets requirements enforced by FDA, Health Canada, and other worldwide regulatory authorities. We have an extensive Quality Assurance team at Access Dental Lab.
State professional regulation
Our ability to conduct business in each state is dependent in part upon that particular state’s treatment of remote healthcare delivery under such state’s laws, rules and policies governing the practice of dentistry, which are subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. Orthodontists and dentists who provide professional services to a patient via teledentistry must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice or to provide treatment in the state in which the patient is located. In addition, certain states require an orthodontist or dentist providing teledentistry services to be physically located in the same state as the patient. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can give rise to civil or criminal penalties.
We have been successful in working with several state dental boards in creating teledentistry rules and regulations which support our model. In addition, more than 20 state dental boards have affirmatively rejected complaints filed by certain trade associations that we are engaged in the corporate practice of dentistry or are otherwise violating state regulations regarding the practice of dentistry. However, two state dental boards established rules or interpreted existing rules in a manner that purports to limit or restrict our ability to conduct our business as currently conducted. The Georgia Board of Dentistry passed a rule that requires a licensed dentist to be present when 3D oral images are taken by a dental assistant, and the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama interpreted existing rules to require “direct supervision” (meaning a dentist must be physically present somewhere in the building) for the taking of a digital image. In both Georgia and Alabama, we filed lawsuits in Federal court against the dental boards and their individual members alleging, among other things, violations of the Sherman Act and interfering with our business model. Both the Alabama and Georgia courts upheld our ability to move forward against individual dental board members, in their official capacity. Both matters were then sent to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals as a result of the dental boards in both states appealing the lower court’s decisions. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) participated in oral arguments in support of SmileDirectClub. The DOJ’s antitrust chief presented in the Alabama matter. On August 11, 2020, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Georgia district court’s denial of the board members’ motion to dismiss. On December 8, 2020, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals voted to have a rehearing en banc. The FTC and DOJ filed an Amicus Brief and participated in oral argument that was held on February 23, 2021. On July 20, 2021 the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the Company’s favor, finding that the Georgia Dental Board did not have an interlocutory right of appeal and therefore denied the Georgia Board’s appeal. On July 29, 2021, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals also denied the Alabama Dental Board’s appeal. Both cases were remanded to the respective District Courts to proceed accordingly into the discovery phase. 
In 2021, the Alabama Dental Board and the Company entered into a tentative settlement agreement, subject to the FTC’s proposed Consent Order being entered into by the Board, precluding the Alabama Dental Board from engaging in conduct intended to preclude teledentistry in the State of Alabama or to preclude dentists and orthodontists from using the Company’s teledentistry platform to treat patients. On December 22, 2021, the Consent Order was finalized and the District Court in Alabama thereafter entered its order approving the joint motion for dismissal of the lawsuit per the terms of the settlement reached between the parties. In October 2019, we also filed a lawsuit against the California Dental Board, its members and one of its investigators for engaging in anticompetitive and harassing conduct. The California Dental Board filed a motion to dismiss and the District Court granted that Motion. We appealed the lower court’s decision and the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as the Pacific Legal Foundation, all filed amicus briefs on our behalf. Oral argument was held on July 26, 2021 with the FTC and DOJ arguing in support of the Company at oral argument as well. The appellate court has not yet issued its ruling. 
In New Jersey, the Dental Association filed a lawsuit alleging that SmileDirectClub was engaging in the illegal corporate practice of dentistry, without the support or inclusion of the New Jersey Dental Board as a party. In January 2020, the New Jersey court ruled in our favor, granting our motion for summary judgement. The New Jersey Dental Board appealed that ruling and the ruling of the lower court was affirmed by the Appellate Division on June 11, 2021. The Board filed a Notice of Petition for Certification with the Supreme Court of New Jersey on June 28, 2021. No decision on whether to accept the Petition and allow an appeal has been rendered. In addition, a national orthodontic association has met with various dental boards across the country in an effort to advocate for new rules and regulations that could have the effect of interfering with our business model. In October 2019, California passed a law requiring doctors using telehealth to prescribe clear aligner therapy to review a patient’s most recent x-ray or other bone imaging suitable for orthodontia. This law went into effect on January 1, 2020 but has not had any material impact on our operations. To date, none of these efforts have resulted in rules and regulations being passed that interfere with our business model in a material way, and we have engaged lobbyists to assist in educating policy makers about our positions. Legislation has been introduced in a handful of states mirroring the recent law in California or to require mandatory in person office visits or the taking and review of radiographs. To date none of these laws have been passed. Legislation has also been introduced and passed in more than 30 states specifically supporting and promoting telehealth and/or teledentistry, including but not limited to requiring insurance companies to pay for such services. We continually monitor these proposed laws and other legal and regulatory developments to understand their potential impact on our operations.
 DSO regulation
We are engaged by a network of professional corporations (“PCs”) and their affiliated doctors to provide a suite of non-clinical administrative support services, including access to and use of our teledentistry platform, as a Dental Support Organization (“DSO”). As a result, we are required to register in those states that require registrations of DSOs, which currently include Nevada, Kansas, and Texas.
The doctors affiliated with our network of PCs are licensed to practice dentistry in their respective states and are engaged as employees or independent contractors of these PCs. These PCs are owned by independent doctors and are registered to engage in business in their respective states. It is through these PCs that the clinical services for clear aligner therapy are rendered to our customers. We enter into a suite of agreements with each of the PCs to provide its DSO services. In addition, we are also a supplier of the clear aligner products to these PCs and enter into a Supply Agreement with each of the PCs accordingly. The District Court in New Jersey ruled that this structure and suite of agreements comply with the laws of the state of New Jersey precluding the corporate practice of dentistry.
Consumer credit compliance
Our SmilePay program subjects us to complex consumer financial protection laws and regulations, among others. We must comply with all applicable U.S. federal and state regulatory regimes, including but not limited to those governing consumer retail installment credit transactions. Certain U.S. federal and state laws generally regulate the rate or amount of finance charges and fees and require certain disclosures for consumer finance transactions. In particular, we may be subject to laws such as:
•state laws and regulations that impose requirements related to credit disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, debt servicing, and collection;
•the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws, which require certain disclosures to customers regarding the terms and conditions of their transactions;
•Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Consumer Financial Protection Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service, and similar state laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices;
•the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder and state non-discrimination laws, which generally prohibit creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of, among other things, race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act;
•the Fair Credit Reporting Act as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and similar state laws, which promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies;
•the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state, and local debt collection laws, which provide guidelines and limitations on the conduct of debt collectors and creditors in connection with the collection of consumer debts;
•Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and similar state privacy laws, which include limitations on financial institutions’ disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, in certain circumstances require financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by nonaffiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information, and require financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and nonaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal customer information, and other privacy laws and regulations;
•the Bankruptcy Code and similar state insolvency laws, which limit the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for protection or relief from claims of creditors;
•the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act and similar state laws, which allow military members and certain dependents to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations, as well as limit applicable rates, so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties;
•the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which provide disclosure requirements, guidelines, and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ deposit accounts;
•the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures and, with consumer consent, permits required disclosures to be provided electronically; and
•the Bank Secrecy Act, which relates to compliance with anti-money laundering, customer due diligence, and record-keeping policies and procedures.
Other U.S. federal and state laws
We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the U.S. concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials, price reporting and regulation, the promotion, sales and marketing of our products and services, the importation and exportation of our products, reimbursement for our products and services, the operation of our facilities, and the distribution of our products. Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies, and the private sector regarding these matters, including efforts to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally, are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment and other measures on our future business.
We contract with orthodontists, dentists, or professional corporations to deliver our products and services to their patients. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws that prohibit the practice of dentistry by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the orthodontist’s or dentist’s professional judgment. In addition, laws in various states also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be 
considered an element of the practice of dentistry in many states. Under the corporate practice of dentistry restrictions of certain states, non-clinical decisions and activities may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of dentistry. Further, certain states have requirements for DSOs, such as us. We have registered as a DSO in all states in which we are required to do so. We continually monitor state requirements as to what constitutes the practice of dentistry and take steps to ensure that the orthodontists and dentists who utilize our services and teledentistry platform handle all clinical aspects of their patients’ care to ensure we do not violate those laws and regulations.
As a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal, state, and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be, applicable to our business. Furthermore, our network of orthodontists and general dentists is also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us. Laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects.
Several states have fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws that apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program, or apply regardless of payor. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Health information privacy and security laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (“PII”), including health information. Among others, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (“PHI”) and require covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, among other requirements. We are regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA.
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule which requires notification to affected individuals and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and in certain cases to media outlets, in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states, and HIPAA standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance.
Many states in which we operate and in which our customers reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA on June 28, 2018, which went into effect January 1, 2020. On November 3, 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which amends the CCPA and adds new privacy protections that became effective on January 1, 2023, was enacted through a ballot initiative. While information we maintain that is covered by HIPAA may be exempt from the CCPA, other records and information we maintain on our customers may be subject to the CCPA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state and federal privacy laws subject to frequent change.
In addition to HIPAA and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting, and laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach.
Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. The E.U., for example, traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under its laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection than the U.S. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which governs data practices and privacy in the E.U., became effective and provides a basis for the data protection laws of the individual member states. The E.U.’s GDPR requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data of individuals in the E.U. These more stringent requirements include expanded disclosures to inform individuals about how we may use their personal data, increased controls on profiling individuals, and increased rights for individuals to access, control and delete their personal data. In addition, there are mandatory data breach notification requirements. The law also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, which may result in monetary penalties of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a group’s worldwide turnover, whichever is higher. GDPR and other similar regulations require companies to give specific types of notice and informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device for online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes and for direct electronic marketing, and the GDPR also imposes additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents. It remains unclear how the U.K. data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the U.K. from the E.U. will be regulated. 
We are subject to Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and similar provincial laws in Canada. PIPEDA is the federal privacy law for private-sector organizations. It sets out the ground rules for how businesses must handle personal information in the course of commercial activity. Under PIPEDA, we must obtain an individual’s consent when we collect, use or disclose that individual’s personal information. Individuals have the right to access and challenge the accuracy of their personal information held by an organization, and personal information may only be used for the purposes for which it was collected. If an organization intends to use personal information for another purpose, it must again obtain that individual’s consent. Failure to comply with PIPEDA could result in significant fines and penalties or possible damage awards for the tort of public humiliation.
We are subject to the Australian Privacy Act of 1988 (“Privacy Act”), of which the Australian Government is conducting a review and updates to the law are actively under review. The Privacy Act regulates the private sector’s use of personal information, and also includes a data breach notification scheme. The updated law is anticipated to touch on issues relating to how “personal information” is defined, the use of third-party cookies, requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, and what constitutes adequate consent. 
There are many other countries with data protection laws, and new countries are adopting data protection legislation with increasing frequency. Many of these laws may require consent from individuals for the use of data for various purposes, including marketing, which may reduce our ability to market our products. There is no harmonized approach to these laws and regulations globally. Consequently, we increase our risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data protection laws and regulations when we expand internationally. We may need to change and limit the way we use personal information in operating our business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices and divergent operating models, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and subject us to additional liabilities.
Environmental Matters
We have no material expenditures for compliance with Federal, State or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
Human Capital Management
Our Team Members
We have approximately 2,700 team members, including those who work remotely, at our headquarters and our manufacturing facilities in Tennessee, our facilities in Costa Rica, our International team and at SmileShops and popup locations. We service customers across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, the U.K., Ireland, and France. We operate as a remote optional workforce for team members responsible for customer care, marketing, finance, legal, people and organization, information technology, data science, and analytics. Our team members at our Antioch, Tennessee manufacturing facility are primarily responsible for developing, overseeing and carrying out manufacturing operations, while our team members in Costa Rica are primarily treatment plan setup technicians, licensed orthodontic consultants, and additional customer care team members. We believe that our relations with our team members are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
Company Culture 

We are committed to recognizing, valuing, and engaging our top-tier talent, who are at the core of our success. We survey our team members to measure team engagement and the drivers behind the level of engagement and use survey results to drive team-level actions for continuous improvement, learning and development. We believe the next great idea can come from anywhere within our company, and numerous impactful initiatives have come from team member feedback, including flexible work hours, unlimited time off for exempt team members, lower deductible healthcare plans, work/life balance promotion, and wellness initiatives for physical and mental health, such as instructor-led mindfulness courses, access to virtual workouts, and resources such as access to counseling and mindfulness apps.
Our culture is built around collaboration and innovation. We created a team member focus group, our Culture Council, that allows team members to work together and propose initiatives that impact the organization, while promoting our culture and sense of inclusion and belonging. The Culture Council has initiated various events, such as virtual networking events, that connect team members of all different levels within the organization while we continue to work from home.
We are dedicated to investing in our team members and facilitating engagement and recognition initiatives across the company. We promote direct access to leadership and connect our team members to our company vision through company and team town halls and recognition-based “Fireside Chats” with our leadership. We celebrate the hard work and dedication of our team members through our global recognition platform, Chompions, team happy hours or coffee chats, holiday-based events, and work anniversary celebrations, among other ways. 
Talent Development and Training 
We are committed to pursuing competitive advantage through filling our most important roles with the best talent, and have established succession planning processes and talent reviews for our global workforce. Our executives and their supporting leadership teams participated in training and development programs as part of this rollout, demonstrating top-down support. Succession planning discussions and efforts were completed for each team with unique action plans identified for retention and development of our critical talent and those in mission critical roles. 
Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging
We are committed to the life-changing potential of inclusion and the power of diversity. We strive to listen, learn, and adapt to champion our team members. We have been seeking to achieve transformational change through a variety of initiatives, including the formation of our Inclusion, Diversity, and Belonging Council. This team is represented by highly engaged team members from across the organization. Our strategic areas of focus include learning and development, recruitment, workforce representation and retention, and a culture of belonging.

Information about our Executive Officers
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of March 1, 2023.

Name | Age | Position 
David Katzman | 63 | Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 
Steven Katzman | 59 | Chief Operating Officer and Director 
Troy Crawford | 55 | Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer 
Susan Greenspon Rammelt | 58 | Chief Legal Officer, EVP Business Affairs, Secretary, and Director
