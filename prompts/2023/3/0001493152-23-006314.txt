ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
TETE was incorporated as a blank check company on November 8, 2021, under the laws of the Cayman Islands, for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.”
 
TETE’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that its corporate existence will cease and it will liquidate the trust account (described herein) and distribute the funds included therein to the holders of ordinary shares sold in its IPO if it does not consummate a business combination by July 20, 2023.
 
Offering Proceeds Held in Trust
 
On January 20, 2022, TETE consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, TETE consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 480,000 units to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds to TETE in the amount of $4,800,000.
 
On January 20, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,500,000 units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The over-allotment option units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to TETE of $15,000,000. Also, in connection with the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 52,500 private placement units at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit.
 
Following the closing of the IPO on January 20, 2022, an amount of $116,725,000 ($10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO and the private placement was placed in a trust account which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by TETE meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by TETE, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account.. As of the date of this proxy statement, funds in the trust account totaled approximately US$32 million.
 
On January 18, 2023, TETE held its extraordinary meeting of shareholders. During this meeting, TETE’s shareholders approved the proposals to (i) amend TETE’s Amended and Restated Articles of Association to give TETE the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time, from January 20, 2023 to July 20, 2023; (ii) amend TETE’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of January 14, 2022, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to allow the Company to extend the Combination Period up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time from January 20, 2023 to the Extended Date by depositing into the Trust Account, for each one-month extension, the lesser of (a) $262,500 and (b) $0.0525 for each Class A ordinary share outstanding, and (iii) amend the Articles of Association to expand the methods that TETE may employ to not become subject to the “penny stock” rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 20, 2023, 8,373,932 Public Shares were redeemed by a number of shareholders at a price of approximately US$10.31 per share, in an aggregate principal amount of US$86,353,885. On January 20, 2022, TETE issued an unsecured promissory note to its Sponsor, in the amount of US$$164,119, which amount was deposited into the trust account to extend the available time to complete a business combination to February 20, 2023. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if TETE has not consummated a business combination by January 20, 2023 (or July 20, 2023, if further extended).

As of February 28, 2023, we had approximately US$207,763 of unused net proceeds that were not deposited into the trust fund to pay future general and administrative expenses. The net proceeds deposited into the trust fund remain on deposit in the trust fund earning interest. As of the date of this proxy statement, there was, as a result of the redemptions discussed above, approximately US$32 million in TETE’s trust account.
    TETE Units, Public Shares, and TETE Warrants are each quoted on Nasdaq, under the symbols “TETEU,” “TETE,” and “TETEW,” respectively. Each of TETE Units consist of one ordinary share and one redeemable warrant. TETE Units commenced trading on January 20, 2022. Public Shares and TETE Warrants commenced trading on March 7, 2022.
 
Business Combination Activities 
 
On October 19, 2022, TETE entered into an agreement and plan of merger (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among TETE, TETE Technologies Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian private limited company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TETE (“Merger Sub”), Super Apps Holdings Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian private limited company (“Super Apps”), Technology & Telecommunication LLC (the “Sponsor”), as representative of TETE shareholders, and Loo See Yuen, as representative of the Super Apps shareholders. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Super Apps will merge with TETE Technologies Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian private limited company and wholly owned subsidiary of TETE, with Super Apps surviving and TETE acquiring 100% of the equity securities of Super Apps. In exchange for their equity securities, the shareholders of Super Apps will receive an aggregate number of ordinary shares of TETE (the “Merger Consideration”) with an aggregate value equal to: (a) one billion one hundred million U.S. Dollars ($1,100,000,000), minus (b) any Closing Net Indebtedness (as defined in the Merger Agreement), of which $235,000,000 will be paid at the closing of the Business Combination with the remaining $865,000,000 subject to the earn-out provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
The Business Combination has been approved by the boards of directors of each of TETE and Super Apps. The Business Combination will require the approval of the shareholders of TETE and Super Apps and is subject to other customary closing conditions, including a proxy statement being filed with and cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023.


Redemption Rights
 
Pursuant to TETE’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, TETE shareholders (except the Initial Shareholders and the officers and directors of TETE) will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata share of the trust account (currently anticipated to be approximately US$10.27 per ordinary share for shareholders) net of taxes payable.
 
TETE’s Initial Shareholders do not have redemption rights with respect to any TETE Shares owned by them, directly or indirectly (nor will they seek appraisal rights with respect to such ordinary shares if appraisal rights would be available to them).
 
Automatic Dissolution and Subsequent Liquidation of trust account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not consummate an initial business combination by January 20, 2023 (or July 20, 2023, if further extended), it will trigger our automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of TETE’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Cayman Companies Act. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation.
 
Pursuant to the terms of TETE’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our Initial Shareholders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account, for each one-month extension after January 20, 2023 and until July 20, 2023, the lesser of (a) $262,500 and (b) $0.0525 for each Class A ordinary share outstanding, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Our Initial Shareholders or their affiliates or designees will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional units at a price of US$10.00 per unit, which are the same as the Private Placement Units. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten Business Days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.

The amount in the trust account under the Cayman Companies Act will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Cayman Companies Act provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.
 
Each of our Initial Shareholders and our Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the Insider Shares and Private Placement Units and to vote their Insider Shares and private shares in favor of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless.
 
If we are unable to consummate a business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share distribution from the trust account would be approximately US$10.27.
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.

Technology & Telecommunication LLC, our Sponsor, has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of the IPO not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy those obligations if it is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than US$10.15 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least US$10.15 per share.
 
Facilities and Headquarters
 
We maintain our principal executive offices at C3-2-23A, Jalan 1/152, Taman OUG Parklane, Off Jalan Kelang Lama, 58200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The cost for this space is provided to us by Technology & Telecommunication LLC, as part of the US$10,000 per month payment we make to it for office space and related services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. We expected our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). Accordingly, as management has located a suitable target business to acquire, they are presently spending more time negotiating and processing the Business Combination than they were previously in locating and investigating target businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.
 
For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on January 19, 2022.

TECHNOLOGY & TELECOMMUNICATION ACQUISITION CORPORATION
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 November 30, 2022
 
Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations
 
Technology & Telecommunication Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Cayman Islands on November 8, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
As of November 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from November 8, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation and initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected November 30 as its fiscal year end.
 
The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on January 14, 2022. On January 20, 2022, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (“Units” and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 which is described in Note 3.
 
The Initial Public Offering transaction costs amounted to $8,482,742 consisting of $1,800,000 of underwriting fees paid in cash, $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”)), $1,725,000 funded to the trust account and $932,742 of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of $1,562,293 was held outside of the Trust Account on January 20, 2022 and was available for working capital purposes. As described in Note 6, the $4,025,000 deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 480,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) to Technology & Telecommunication LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $4,800,000.
 
On January 20, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,500,000 Option Units pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option. The Option Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $15,000,000. Also, in connection with the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 52,500 Option Private Placement Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit.
 
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 20, 2022, an amount of $116,725,000 ($10.15 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued)
 
The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least $10.15 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in the Trust Account and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.
 
The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.15 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”.
 
The Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that it does not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.
 
If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.
 
The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued)
 
If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 12 months (or 15 months, or 18 months, as applicable from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.
 
The holders of the Founders Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).
 
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.15 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.15 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company’s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
   As of November 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $491,293 of cash in its operating account and working capital of approximately $386,445.
   Prior to the completion of the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s liquidity needs had been satisfied through the capital contribution of $25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, and a loan of up to $300,000 pursuant to the Note issued to the Sponsor, which was repaid on January 25, 2022 (Note 5). Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, the Company’s liquidity needs have been satisfied with the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account.
   Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (Continued)
 
Going Concern and Management’s Plan
 
The Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it pursues an initial business combination target. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” the Company does not currently have adequate liquidity to sustain operations, which consist solely of pursuing a Business Combination.
 
The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (except as described above), loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its needs through the earlier of consummation of a Business Combination or the deadline to complete a Business Combination pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (unless otherwise amended by shareholders).
 
While the Company expects to have sufficient access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current commitment on the part of any financing source to provide additional capital and no assurances can be provided that such additional capital will ultimately be available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to raise additional capital (to the extent ultimately necessary) or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
As is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the Combination Period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination during the Combination Period.
 
Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company had $491,293 in cash and no cash equivalents as of November 30, 2022 ($nil as of November 30, 2021).
Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account
 
At November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market. The amount of assets held in Trust Account is $118,051,997 and $0 respectively.
Income Taxes
 
The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
 
ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company’s management determined the United States is the Company’s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of November 30, 2022 and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.

Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
 
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
 
All of the Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with ASC 480, conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (shareholders’ equity) to be less than $5,000,001. However, the threshold in its charter would not change the nature of the underlying shares as redeemable and thus public shares would be required to be disclosed outside of permanent equity. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value ($10.15 per share) at the end of each reporting period. Such changes are reflected in additional paid-in capital, or in the absence of additional capital, in accumulated deficit.
 
As of November 30, 2022, 11,500,000 Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding are subject to possible redemption.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. On November 30, 2022, the Company had not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
 
Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and warrants issued as components of the Private Placement Units (the “Placement Warrants”) since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.
 
The Company’s statements of operations includes a presentation of income (loss) per share for ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in a manner similar to the two-class method of income (loss) per share. Net income (loss) per ordinary share, basic and diluted, for redeemable Class A ordinary shares is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) allocable to Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, by the weighted average number of redeemable Class A ordinary shares outstanding since original issuance. Net income (loss) per ordinary share, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable Class A and Class B ordinary shares is calculated by dividing net income (loss) allocable to non-redeemable ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of non-redeemable ordinary shares outstanding for the periods. Non-redeemable Class B ordinary shares include the founder shares as these ordinary shares do not have any redemption features and do not participate in the income earned on the Trust Account.

Offering Costs Associated with the Initial Public Offering
 
The Company complies with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5A, “Expenses of Offering.” Offering costs of $4,532,887 consist principally of costs incurred in connection with formation of the Company and preparation for the Initial Public Offering. These costs, together with the underwriter discount of $4,025,000, were charged to additional paid-in capital upon completion of the Initial Public Offering.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
 
● Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;
 
● Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
 
● Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
 
In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Recent Accounting Standards
 
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt —Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and free-standing instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company adopted as of inception of the Company. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.”

Note 3 —Initial Public Offering
 
Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 11,500,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $115,000,000. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
Note 4 — Private Placement
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 532,500 units (the “Private Placement Units”) to Technology & Telecommunication, LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $5,325,000
 
A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Units was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Placement Units will be worthless.
 
The Private Placement Warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Note 5 — Related Party Transactions
 
Founder Shares
 
On November 26, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) in exchange for $25,000. The Founder Shares include an aggregate of up to 375,000 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the number of Founder Shares will equal, on an as-converted basis, approximately 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Initial Public Offering. The Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture due to full exercise of the over-allotment by the underwriter.
 
The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Public Shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.

Related Party Loans
 
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of November 30, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.
Administrative Support Agreement
 
Commencing on the date the Units are first listed on the Nasdaq, the Company has agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support for up to 18 months. Upon completion of the Initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. As of November 30, 2022, $100,000 had been accrued and not yet been paid to the Sponsor under the Administrative Support Agreement.

Note 6 — Commitments and Contingencies
 
Registration Rights
 
The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of Initial Public Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to Class A ordinary shares). The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Underwriters Agreement
 
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
The underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $2,000,000 in the aggregate (or $2,300,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The underwriters agreed to reimburse us for expenses incurred by us in connection with this offering in an amount equal to $500,000, payable to us at the closing of the offering. In addition, the underwriters were entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $3,500,000 in the aggregate (or $4,025,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full). The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
 
On January 20, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,500,000 Option Units pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option. The Option Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $15,000,000.

Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity
 
Preference Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of November 30, 2022, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding.
 
Class A Ordinary Shares — Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the Company to issue 479,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of November 30, 2022, there were 532,500 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding (excluding 11,500,000 shares subject to possible redemption).
 
Class B Ordinary Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of November 30, 2022, there were 2,875,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, such that the Initial Shareholders would maintain ownership of at least 20% of the issued and outstanding shares after the Proposed Public Offering.
 
Only holders of the Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into a shareholders’ agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of this offering.
 
The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of a Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (net of the number of Class A ordinary shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination), excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller of an interest in the target to us in a Business Combination.
 
Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 November 30, 2022
 
The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within 60 business days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
 
Redemption of Warrants When the Price per Share of Class A Ordinary shares Equals or Exceeds $18.00 — Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:
 

● | in whole and not in part; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant; 
● | upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, or the 30-day redemption period to each warrant holder; and 
● | if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to warrant holders. 

 
If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
 
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.
 
The Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering.
