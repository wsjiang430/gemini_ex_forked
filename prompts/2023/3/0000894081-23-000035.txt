ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation and related services. We lease converted freighter aircraft to customers throughout North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Our total in service fleet is comprised of 128 freighter and passenger aircraft as of December 31, 2022. To support the needs of our leasing customers, and the aviation and logistics industries at large, we offer a broad array of complementary solutions ranging from flight and ground operations to aircraft maintenance and overhaul services. When the context requires, we may use the terms “Company,” "we," "our" and “us” in this Form 10-K to refer to the business of Air Transport Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References in this Form 10-K to "ATSG" are solely to Air Transport Services Group, Inc.
For over 40 years, our subsidiaries have been providing airlift, ground operations and maintenance services to the air transportation industry. Air Transport Services Group, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered at the Wilmington Air Park in Wilmington, Ohio. 
Strategy
Our primary business segment is aircraft leasing. We acquire used medium wide-body and narrow-body passenger aircraft, manage their conversion into a freighter configuration leveraging our experience as an airline then lease the converted freighters to customers under long-term contracts. The aircraft we target for conversion are ideal for express and e-commerce driven regional air networks. As a result, our aircraft can be deployed into regional markets more economically than larger capacity aircraft, newly built aircraft or other competing alternatives. 
We distinguish ourselves from, and gain an advantage over, our competitors by offering a breadth of integrated, complementary aviation- and logistics-related services. Our broad range of ancillary services include aircraft maintenance and modifications, engine leases and sort and gateway operations.
Our business development and marketing efforts leverage the entire portfolio of our capabilities to create a customized bundled solution to meet our customers' needs. Our ability to offer our customers differentiated services, including aircraft leasing, airline express operations, line and heavy maintenance, and ground handling services makes us unique from other providers in our industry.
Services
We have two reportable segments: Cargo Aircraft Management Inc. ("CAM"), which includes the leasing of aircraft and aircraft engines, and ACMI Services, which includes the cargo and passenger aircraft flight operations of our three airlines. Our other business operations, which primarily provide support services to the transportation industry, do not constitute reportable segments.
CAM
We own and lease aircraft through our subsidiary, CAM. We acquire used passenger aircraft, typically 15-20 years old, and cause them to be converted to a freighter aircraft configuration. Following conversion, we lease those aircraft externally under long-term contracts to a customer base that includes Amazon.com Services, LLC (“ASI”), DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. and its affiliates (“DHL”), and other airlines as well as internally to our own airline subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2022, we owned 111 Boeing aircraft that were in revenue service. We also owned 15 Boeing 767-300 aircraft and seven Airbus 321-200 aircraft either undergoing or awaiting induction into the freighter conversion process. A complete list of our aircraft is included in Item 2, Properties. In response to market demand, we have agreements to expand the fleet through the modification of additional Boeing 767-300 and Airbus A321 and A330 aircraft over the next few years. 
We are the world's largest owner of converted Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. Our freighter fleet is comprised primarily of Boeing 767 aircraft, which are desirable in regional air networks because of their reliability, cubic cargo capacity and durable performance. Each of the Boeing 767 aircraft we acquire and convert to freighter configuration 
is expected to have an economic life of at least 20 years. The demand for this aircraft type remains strong and it is expected to remain our primary mid-sized freighter aircraft for the foreseeable future. We have agreements with two aircraft conversion providers, Israel Aerospace Industries ("IAI") and The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), to convert additional Boeing aircraft over the next three years.
Through a joint venture with Precision Aircraft Solutions, LLC, we have developed a design for the conversion of Airbus A321 passenger aircraft into a freighter configuration and in 2021 were granted a Supplemental Type Certificate (“STC”) for such design (An STC is granted by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and represents an ownership right, similar to an intellectual property right, which authorizes the alteration of an airframe, engine or component.). The converted Airbus A321 freighter is well suited for air-express service and e-commerce fulfillment over shorter routes with smaller payloads than the Boeing 767. The Airbus A321 can operate with more fuel efficiency than the comparable freighter aircraft variants of the Boeing 737 and Boeing 757. We have begun acquiring Airbus A321 aircraft for conversion to grow our fleet and further support our ability to meet the growing demand worldwide for narrow-body freighter aircraft.
We have also entered into an agreement with Elbe Flugzeugwerke (“EFW”) to secure the right to convert 29 Airbus A330 passenger aircraft to a freighter configuration with EFW. The first aircraft induction is expected to occur in 2023. The Airbus A330 aircraft can provide capabilities similar to the Boeing 767 for medium wide-body airlift. The pending addition of this aircraft type to our fleet has already began to open new streams of customer interest and demand internationally.
Under a typical lease arrangement, the customer maintains the aircraft in serviceable condition at its own cost. At the end of the lease term, the customer is typically required to return the aircraft in approximately the same maintenance condition that existed at the inception of the lease, as measured by airframe and engine time and cycles since the last scheduled maintenance event. CAM examines the credit worthiness of potential customers, their short and long-term growth prospects, their financial condition and backing, the experience of their management, and the impact of governmental regulations when determining the lease rate that is offered to the customer. In addition, CAM monitors the customer’s business and financial status throughout the term of the lease. 
ACMI Services
ACMI Services consists of the operations of our three airline subsidiaries: ABX Air, Inc. (“ABX”), Air Transport International, Inc. (“ATI”), and Omni Air International, LLC (“OAI”). Each of these airlines is independently certificated by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and the FAA. 
A typical operating agreement for airline services requires us to supply a combination of aircraft, crew, maintenance and/or insurance for specified transportation operations. These services are commonly referred to as ACMI, CMI or charter services depending on the selection of services contracted by the customer. The customer bears the responsibility for capacity utilization and unit pricing in all cases. 
ACMI - The airline provides the aircraft, flight crews, aircraft maintenance and aircraft hull and liability insurance while the customer is typically responsible for substantially all other aircraft operating expenses, including fuel, landing fees, parking fees and ground and cargo handling expenses. 
CMI - The customer is responsible for providing the aircraft, in addition to the fuel and other operating expenses. The airline provides the flight crews, aircraft hull and liability insurance and typically aircraft line maintenance as needed between network flights. 
Charter - The airline is responsible for providing full service, including fuel, aircraft, flight crews, maintenance, aircraft hull and liability insurance, landing fees, parking fees, catering, passenger handling fees, ground and cargo handling expenses and other operating expenses for an all-inclusive price. 
The majority of the aircraft operated by our airlines are owned by CAM. Those aircraft are either leased directly to CAM's customer or leased to one of our airlines. A summary of our airlines is below:
ABX 
ABX operates Boeing 767 aircraft exclusively in freighter configuration. ABX specializes in providing aircraft operations to customers in the e-commerce and express delivery markets, with DHL as its largest customer.
ATI
ATI operates Boeing 767 freighter aircraft and Boeing 757 “combi” aircraft, which are capable of simultaneously carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck. ATI operates its fleet of Boeing 767 primarily for the express package industry and freight forwarders, with ASI as its largest customer. It operates its fleet of Boeing 757 “combi” aircraft primarily for the United States Department of Defense ("DoD").
OAI
In November 2018, we acquired OAI, a passenger airline, along with its related entities. OAI operates Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 passenger aircraft. OAI carries passengers worldwide for a variety of private sector customers and government services agencies. It provides tailored passenger and government charter services, airline startup and route development services.
ABX, ATI and OAI are each participants in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”), a National Emergency Preparedness Program designed to augment the airlift capability of the DoD and meet the national security interests and contingency requirements of the U.S. Transportation Command (“USTC”). The combined efforts of our airlines make us the nation’s largest provider of passenger charter service to DoD and other governmental agencies.
Support Services 
We provide a wide range of air transportation related services to our customers including aircraft maintenance and modification, ground support and crew training. 
Aircraft Maintenance and Modification
Our aircraft maintenance and modification services, which are provided primarily by our subsidiaries Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc. (“AMES”) and Pemco World Air Services, Inc. ("Pemco"), provide airframe modification and heavy maintenance, component repairs, engineering services and aircraft line maintenance. Another subsidiary, AMES Material Services, Inc., resells and brokers aircraft parts. AMES and Pemco are certified by the FAA under Part 145 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs"). Pemco performs passenger-to-freighter and passenger-to-combi conversions for certain Boeing series aircraft and has begun performing passenger-to-freighter conversions for Airbus A321 aircraft. Both AMES and Pemco own many STCs and similar approvals issued by the FAA which are marketed to its customers.
Ground Support 
Through our subsidiary, LGSTX Services Inc. ("LGSTX"), we provide labor and management for cargo load transfer and sorting; the design, installation and maintenance of material handling equipment; the leasing and maintenance of ground support equipment; and general facilities maintenance. LGSTX also resells aviation fuel at the airpark in Wilmington, Ohio.
Crew Training
Our support services also involve the training of flight crews, which we offer through our subsidiary, Airborne Training Services, Inc. ("ATS"). ATS is certificated under Part 142 of the FARs to offer flight crew training to customers. ATS also offers Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 flight simulators which can be rented by customers for use in conjunction with their flight training programs. 
Major Customers
We have long-standing, strategic customer relationships with ASI, the DoD, and DHL, described below.
Amazon
We have been providing aircraft, flight operations, cargo handling and logistics support services to ASI, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), since September 2015. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an Air Transportation Services Agreement (as amended, the “ATSA”) with ASI pursuant to which we lease Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to ASI through our subsidiary, CAM, operate the aircraft via our airline subsidiaries and are responsible for complying with FAA airworthiness directives, the cost of Boeing 767 airframe maintenance and certain engine maintenance events for the aircraft leased to ASI that we operate. We also provide ground handling services through our subsidiaries. Under the ATSA, we operate aircraft based on pre-defined fees scaled for the number of aircraft hours flown, aircraft scheduled and flight crews provided to ASI for its network. The operating term of the ATSA runs through March 2026 and is thereafter subject to renewal by ASI for an additional three years. Revenues from our commercial arrangements with ASI comprised approximately 34% of our consolidated revenues for 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we were leasing 42 of CAM's Boeing 767 aircraft to ASI under multi-year contracts. We operate all of these aircraft and seven more ASI-provided aircraft under the CMI provisions of the ATSA.
In conjunction with the execution of the ATSA and its amendments, the Company and ASI entered into an Investment Agreement (the "2016 Investment Agreement") and a Stockholders' Agreement on March 8, 2016 and a second Investment Agreement on December 20, 2018 (the "2018 Investment Agreement"). Pursuant to the 2016 and 2018 Investment Agreements, we issued warrants to Amazon in conjunction with aircraft leases. For additional information about the warrants issued under the 2016 and 2018 Investment Agreements, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
U.S. Department of Defense
We have been providing services to the DoD since the 1990’s. The DoD comprised 30% of our consolidated revenues for 2022. Our business with the DoD and other government agencies expanded significantly as a result of our November 2018 acquisition of OAI.
Our participation in CRAF allows our airlines to bid for military charter operations for passenger and cargo transportation. Our airlines provide charter operations to the Air Mobility Command ("AMC") through contracts awarded by the U.S. Transportation Command, both of which are organized under the DoD. 
The USTC secures airlift capacity through fixed awards, which are awarded annually, and through bids for "expansion routes" which are awarded on a quarterly, monthly and as-needed basis. Under the contracts, we are responsible for all operating expenses including fuel, landing and ground handling expenses. We receive reimbursements from the USTC each month if the price of fuel paid by us for the flights exceeds a previously set peg price. If the price of fuel paid by us is less than the peg price, then we pay the difference to the USTC. Airlines may participate in CRAF either independently, or through teaming arrangements with other airlines. Our airlines are members of the Patriot Team of CRAF airlines. We pay a commission to the Patriot Team, based on certain revenues we receive under USTC contracts.
ATI contracts with the USTC to operate its unique fleet of four Boeing 757 "combi" aircraft, which are capable of simultaneously carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck. ATI has been operating combi aircraft for the DoD since 1993. The USTC contracted with ATI to provide combi aircraft operations through September of 2023. OAI has been operating aircraft for the DoD since 1995. Contracts with the USTC are typically for a one-year period; however, the current passenger international charter contract has a two-year term with option periods, at the election of the USTC, through September 2024.
DHL
We have provided aircraft services to DHL under multi-year contracts since August 2003. DHL accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues for 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we were leasing 14 of our Boeing 767 aircraft to DHL under multi-year contracts. We operate 10 of these aircraft for DHL under a separate CMI agreement with DHL, along with six DHL-supplied aircraft. We operate and maintain the aircraft based on pre-defined fees scaled for the number of aircraft hours flown, aircraft scheduled and flight crews provided to DHL for its network. Under the pricing structure of the DHL CMI agreement, we are responsible for complying with FAA airworthiness directives, the cost of Boeing 767 airframe maintenance and certain engine maintenance events for the aircraft leased to DHL that we operate. We also provide ground equipment and maintenance services to DHL in the U.S. In February 2022, DHL agreed to a six-year extension of the DHL CMI agreement through April 2028. 
Further, in the second half of 2022, we began to operate four Boeing 767 aircraft provided by DHL under an additional CMI agreement which currently runs through August of 2027.
Competitive Conditions
Competition for aircraft lease placements is generally affected by aircraft type, aircraft availability and lease rates. The aircraft in our fleet provide cost-effective air transportation for medium range requirements. We target our leases to cargo airlines and delivery companies seeking medium widebody aircraft. Competitors in the aircraft leasing industry include AerCap Holdings N.V. and Altavair Aviation Leasing, among others. 
The primary competitive factors in the air transportation industry are operating costs, fuel efficiency, geographic coverage, aircraft range, aircraft reliability and capacity. The cost of airline operations is significantly impacted by the cost of flight crewmembers, which can vary among airlines depending on their collective bargaining agreements. Competitors in the air transportation industry include Amerijet International, Inc., Atlas Air, Inc., Kalitta Air LLC, Northern Air Cargo, LLC, National Air Cargo Group, Inc., and Western Global Airlines, LLC. Of these, Atlas Air, Inc. and National Air Cargo Group, Inc. (operating as National Airlines) also operate passenger aircraft as does Eastern Airlines, LLC. Cargo airlines also compete for cargo volumes with passenger airlines that have substantial belly cargo capacity.
The aircraft maintenance industry is labor intensive and typically competes based on cost, capabilities and reputation for quality. U.S. airlines may contract for aircraft maintenance with maintenance and repair organizations ("MROs") in other countries or geographies with a lower labor wage base, making the industry highly cost competitive. Other aircraft MROs include AAR Corp and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co.
Demand for air cargo transportation services correlates closely with general economic conditions and the level of commercial activity in a geographic area. Stronger general economic conditions and growth in a region typically increases the need for air transportation. E-commerce growth is a strong indicator of growth in the express and network flying businesses which we enable with our assets and services. Historically, the cargo industry has experienced higher volumes during the fourth calendar quarter of each year due to increased shipments during the holiday season. Generally, time-critical delivery needs, such as just-in-time inventory management, increase the demand for air cargo delivery, while higher costs of aviation fuel generally reduces the demand for air delivery services. When aviation fuel prices increase, shippers will consider using ground transportation if the delivery time allows.
Sustainability
We are committed to integrating sustainability practices into our operations. We have formalized governance and oversight of our sustainability initiatives through a Management Sustainability Committee. The Committee, which is comprised of (i) the respective presidents of each of ATSG's operating subsidiaries; (ii) the Vice President, Human Capital, the Vice President, Controller, the Vice President, Corporate Development, and the Manager, Internal Audit of ATSG; (iii) a representative from the ATSG Information Technology Department, the OAI Information Technology Department, the ATSG Communications Department, and the ATSG Legal Department; and (iv) other officers and employees as determined by from to time by the President and Chief Executive Officer of ATSG, focuses on creating long-term shareholder value through strategic goals and initiatives for environmental, social and governance ("ESG") management. The Committee seeks opportunities to improve employee health and safety, corporate social responsibility, diversity and inclusion and activities related to stakeholder engagement and philanthropy. The Committee reports to the ATSG Leadership Council, which is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Commercial Officer of ATSG, and provides updates to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the ATSG Board of Directors (the "Board").
As part of our commitment to corporate sustainability, we published a Sustainability Report in 2022 describing our environmental sustainability actions and initiatives as well as our efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace and the contributions made to our surrounding communities. The disclosures contained in the Sustainability Report and other voluntary disclosures regarding environmental, social, and governance matters are responsive to various areas of stakeholder interests. 
Human Capital Resources
Description
As of December 31, 2022, our workforce was composed of 5,320 full-time and part-time employees. We employed approximately 1,210 flight crewmembers, 420 flight attendants, 250 flight support personnel, 1,910 aircraft maintenance managers and technicians, 985 employees for ground equipment and logistics services, 45 employees for sales and marketing and 500 employees for administrative functions. In addition to full-time and part-time employees, we often engage contractors and temporary employees to assist in aircraft line maintenance and package sortation during peak operational times. On December 31, 2021, we had approximately 5,280 full-time and part-time employees. Over 99% of our workforce is based in the United States.
Our flight crewmembers and flight attendants are unionized employees. The table below summarizes the representation of our flight crewmembers at December 31, 2022.

Airline | Labor Agreement Unit | ContractAmendableDate | Percentage ofthe Company’sEmployees
ABX | International Brotherhood of Teamsters | 1/1/2027 | 6.1% 
ATI | Air Line Pilots Association | 3/21/2021 | 10.2% 
OAI | International Brotherhood of Teamsters | 4/1/2021 | 6.4% 
OAI | Association of Flight Attendants | 11/14/2023 | 0.8% 
OAI | Association of Flight Attendants | 12/1/2021 | 7.1% 

Under the Railway Labor Act, as amended (“RLA”), crewmember labor agreements do not expire, so the existing contract remains in effect throughout any negotiation process. If required, mediation under the RLA is conducted by the National Mediation Board ("NMB"), which has the sole discretion as to how long mediation can last and when it will end. In addition to direct negotiations and mediation, the RLA includes a provision for potential arbitration of unresolved issues and a 30-day “cooling-off” period before either party can resort to self-help, including, but not limited to, a work stoppage.
Objectives
Our employees are critical to our on-going success. Our approach to managing human capital includes the following: maintaining the health and safety of our employees; attracting and retaining skilled individuals; continuously improving the skills of our workforce; promoting inclusive and engaging work environments; and compensating and treating all employees fairly. We believe that every person deserves an equally respectful work environment regardless of race, ethnicity, capability, age, gender, or sexual orientation. We work to maintain a culture of inclusion for all employees. 
To attract and retain skilled employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits, including medical care, paid time off, retirement savings, mental health counseling and other employee benefits. Further, we are committed to training and supporting our employees' continuous development of professional, technical and management skills. We develop technical training programs which facilitate the licensure and certification of flight crews, aviation mechanics and other skilled jobs. We partner with third parties to assist employees in developing leadership skills and valuing diversity in our workforce. 
The health and safety of our employees is paramount. Our airline operations rely on flight crews, aircraft maintenance technicians, flight support personnel and aircraft loading personnel. We rely on a skilled workforce to perform aircraft maintenance. Similarly, we staff personnel near airports to sort customer packages, load aircraft and maintain related equipment. We have taken precautions to prevent, detect and limit the spread of corona viruses in the workplace. We have added extra precautions and redundancies related to crew reserves, employee travel protocols, sanitation and other measures. We have encouraged our employees to take precautions and have given our employees the opportunity to get vaccinated. 
We received funds to protect employees' jobs by offsetting payroll expenses under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the "PSP Extension Law"), and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the "American Rescue Plan"). Under the CARES Act, OAI and ATI agreed on behalf of themselves and ABX, to refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits through September 30, 2020, and OAI subsequently agreed, as a condition of receiving funds under the PSP Extension Law and thereafter under the American Rescue Plan, to refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits through March 31, 2021 and September 31, 2021, respectively. 
Flight crewmembers are required to be licensed in accordance with FARs, with specific ratings for the aircraft type to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to operate aircraft. Licenses and medical certifications are subject to recurrent requirements as set forth in the FARs, to include recurrent training and minimum amounts of recent flying experience.
The FAA requires initial and recurrent training for most flight and maintenance personnel. Quality control inspectors must also be licensed and qualified to perform maintenance inspections on Company-operated and maintained aircraft. The majority of our aircraft mechanics have one or more FAA licenses. Our subsidiaries pay for all of the required recurrent training and provide training for their ground service personnel as well. Their training programs have received all required FAA approvals. Similarly, our flight dispatchers and flight followers receive FAA approved training on the airlines' requirements and specific aircraft.
Information Systems
We are dependent on technology to conduct our daily operations including data processing, communications and regulatory compliance. We rely on critical computerized systems for aircraft maintenance records, flight planning, crew scheduling, employee training, financial records, cyber-security and other processes. We utilize information systems to maintain records about the maintenance status and history of each major aircraft component, as required by FAA regulations. Using our information systems, we track aircraft maintenance schedules and also control inventories and maintenance tasks, including the work directives of personnel performing those tasks. We rely on information systems to track crewmember flight and duty times, and crewmember training status. The Company’s flight operations systems coordinate flight schedules and crew schedules. 
We invest significant time and financial resources to acquire, develop and maintain information systems to facilitate our operations. Our information technology infrastructure includes security measures, backup procedures and redundancy capabilities. We rely increasingly on software applications, hosted technologies, data transmissions and cybersecurity safe-guards provided by or in conjunction with third parties. To remain competitive, we must continue to deploy new technologies while controlling costs and maintaining regulatory compliance and security safeguards.

Regulation
Our subsidiaries’ airline operations are primarily regulated by the DOT, the FAA, and the U.S. Transportation Security Administration ("TSA"). Those operations must comply with numerous economic, safety, security and environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. In addition, they must comply with various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations.
Environment
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization ("ICAO"). In 2016, the EPA issued a finding on greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from aircraft and its relationship to air pollution. This finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. In January 2021, the EPA issued a final rule regarding GHG emissions standards for new aircraft engines consistent with ICAO standards that were adopted in 2017. The EPA final rule does not apply to engines on aircraft that are already in service, as is also the case with the ICAO standards. However, President Biden's Administration has stated that it plans to review the EPA emissions standards issued by the prior Administration and, further, the EPA standards have been challenged by several states and environmental organizations. We cannot predict the results of the Biden Administration's review or the outcome of legal challenges to the EPA's final rules. Our subsidiaries’ aircraft meet all currently applicable requirements for engine emission levels.
Related to the EPA GHG finding, in June 2022 the FAA issued proposed fuel efficiency standards in a notice of proposed rule-making ("NPRM") which, as drafted, would apply, inter alia, to in-service aircraft modified after the aircraft have been issued an airworthiness certificate, such as the Boeing 767 aircraft type. Industry trade groups believe this is a mistaken interpretation of the EPA rule and have sought modification in the final rule yet to be issued by FAA. Even if the rule is unchanged and applicable to a number of our subsidiaries’ aircraft, the impact is expected to be minimal. 
Under the Clean Air Act, individual states or the EPA may also adopt regulations requiring reductions in emissions for one or more localities based on the measured air quality at such localities. These regulations may seek to limit or restrict emissions by restricting the use of emission-producing ground service equipment or aircraft 
auxiliary power units. Further, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.
In addition, the European Commission has approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") for GHG emissions to the airline industry. Currently, under the European Union’s ETS, all ABX, ATI and OAI flights that are wholly within the European Union are covered by the ETS requirements, and each year our airlines are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. If the airline's flight activity during the year produces carbon emissions exceeding the number of carbon emissions allowances that it had been awarded, the airline must acquire allowances from other airlines in the open market. Our airlines operate intra-EU flights from time to time and management believes that such flights are operated in compliance with ETS requirements.
Similarly, in 2016, the ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. A pilot phase began in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate, followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 that is also voluntary, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. The United States has agreed to participate in the two voluntary phases. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
The U.S. has also re-entered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 196 countries to reduce GHG emissions, and the effect of the re-entry by the U.S. on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. 
The U.S. government generally regulates aircraft engine noise at its source. However, local airport operators may, under certain circumstances, regulate airport operations based on aircraft noise considerations. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 provides that, in the case of Stage 3 aircraft (all of our operating aircraft satisfy Stage 3 noise compliance requirements), an airport operator must obtain the carriers’ consent to, or the government’s approval of, the rule prior to its adoption. We believe the operation of our airline subsidiaries’ aircraft either complies with or is exempt from compliance with currently applicable local airport rules. However, some airport authorities have adopted local noise regulations, and, to the extent more stringent aircraft operating regulations are adopted on a widespread basis, our airline subsidiaries may be required to spend substantial funds, make schedule changes or take other actions to comply with such local rules.
Department of Transportation
The DOT maintains authority over certain aspects of domestic and international air transportation serving the United States, such as consumer protection, accommodation of passengers with disabilities, requiring a minimum level of insurance and the requirement that a company be “fit” to hold a certificate to engage in air transportation. In addition, the DOT continues to regulate many aspects of international aviation, including the award of certain international routes. The DOT has issued to ABX a Domestic All-Cargo Air Service Certificate for air cargo transportation between all points within the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The DOT has issued to ATI certificate authority to engage in scheduled interstate air transportation, which is currently limited to all-cargo operations. ATI's DOT certificate authority also authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.  Additionally, the DOT has issued to ABX and ATI Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing each of them to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of cargo and mail between the U.S. and all current and future U.S. open-skies partner countries, which currently consists of approximately 130 foreign countries.  ABX and ATI also hold exemption authorities issued by the DOT to conduct scheduled all-cargo operations between the U.S. and certain foreign countries with which the U.S. does not have a liberal ("open-skies") air transportation agreement. The DOT has issued to OAI a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Interstate Charter Air Transportation and a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Foreign Charter Air Transportation that authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail. In 2019, the DOT also issued OAI exemption authority to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of property and mail between the U.S. and all existing and future countries with an open-skies air service agreement with the U.S.
By maintaining these certificates, the Company, through ABX and ATI, can and currently does conduct all-cargo charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Further, 
the certificates issued to ATI and OAI authorize the air carriers to conduct passenger charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Periodically, the DOT re-examines a company’s managerial competence, financial resources and plans, compliance disposition and citizenship in order to determine whether the carrier remains fit, willing and able to engage in the transportation services it is authorized to provide. 
The DOT has the authority to impose civil penalties, or to modify, suspend or revoke our certificates and exemption authorities for cause, including failure to comply with federal laws or DOT regulations. A corporation or a limited liability company structured like a corporation holding the above-referenced certificates and exemption authorities must continuously qualify as a citizen of the United States, which, pursuant to federal law, requires that (1) it be organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state, territory or possession thereof, (2) that its president and at least two-thirds of its board of directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, (3) that no more than 25% of its voting interest be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, and (4) that it not otherwise be subject to foreign control. We believe our airline subsidiaries possess all necessary DOT-issued certificates and authorities to conduct their current operations and that each continues to qualify as a citizen of the United States.
Federal Aviation Administration
The FAA regulates aircraft safety and flight operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, flight dispatch, training, communications, the carriage of hazardous materials and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA issues operating certificates and detailed "operations specifications" to carriers that possess the technical competence to safely conduct air carrier operations. In addition, the FAA issues certificates of airworthiness to each aircraft that meets the requirements for aircraft design and maintenance. ABX, ATI and OAI believe they hold all airworthiness and other FAA certificates and authorities required for the conduct of their business and the operation of their aircraft. The FAA has the power to suspend, modify or revoke such certificates for cause and to impose civil penalties for any failure to comply with federal laws or FAA regulations.
The FAA has the authority to issue regulations, airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, the inspection, maintenance and modification of aircraft and the replacement of aircraft structures, components and parts, based on industry safety findings, the age of the aircraft and other factors. If the FAA were to determine that the aircraft structures or components are not adequate, it could order our airline subsidiaries and other operators to take certain actions, including but not limited to, grounding aircraft, reducing cargo loads, strengthening any structure or component found to be inadequate, or making other modifications to the aircraft. New mandatory directives could also be issued requiring the Company’s airline subsidiaries to inspect and replace aircraft components based on their age or condition. As a routine matter, the FAA issues airworthiness directives applicable to the aircraft operated by our airline subsidiaries, and our airlines comply, sometimes at considerable cost, as part of their aircraft maintenance program.
In addition to the FAA practice of issuing regulations and airworthiness directives as conditions warrant, the FAA has adopted new regulations to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft on a more systematic basis. FAA regulations mandate that aircraft manufacturers establish aircraft limits of validity and service action requirements based on the number of aircraft flight cycles (a cycle being one takeoff and one landing) and flight hours before widespread fatigue damage might occur. Service action requirements include inspections and modifications to preclude development of significant fatigue damage in specific aircraft structural areas. The Boeing Company has provided its recommendations of the limits of validity to the FAA, and the FAA has now approved the limits for the Boeing 757, 767 and 777 model aircraft. Consequently, after the limit of validity is reached for a particular model aircraft, air carriers will be unable to continue to operate the aircraft without the FAA first granting an extension of time to the operator. There can be no assurance that the FAA would extend the deadline, if an extension were to be requested. At this point, we do not foresee a situation in which we would seek an extension from the FAA for an aircraft.
The FAA issued an airworthiness directive ("AD") in December 2021 to address potential 5G C-Band interference with certain aircraft radio altimeters as U.S. wireless providers upgraded to 5G technology in various U.S. wireless markets. The AD requires that those U.S. aircraft types that do not meet “tolerance requirements” either need a filter or upgraded radio altimeter, or they risk operational restrictions at affected airports. Agreements with wireless providers that provided for mitigation measures delayed until June 30, 2023, the need for aircraft 
modifications. Our airline subsidiaries are modifying and upgrading their aircraft fleets as necessary in order to timely comply with the AD requirements.
The FAA requires each of our airline subsidiaries to implement a drug and alcohol testing program with respect to all employees performing safety sensitive functions and, unless already subject to testing, contractor employees that engage in safety sensitive functions. We believe that each of the Company's airlines complies with these regulations.
Transportation Security Administration
The TSA, an administration within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for the screening of passengers and their baggage. TSA rules also require airlines to adopt and comply with standard aircraft operator security programs, including the manner in which cargo must be screened prior to being loaded on aircraft. We believe that our airline subsidiaries comply with all applicable aircraft, passenger and cargo security requirements. The TSA has adopted cargo security-related rules that have imposed additional burdens on our airlines and our customers. The TSA also requires each airline to perform criminal history background checks on all employees. In addition, we may be required to reimburse the TSA for the cost of security services it may provide to the Company’s airline subsidiaries in the future. The TSA holds (and has exercised) authority to issue regulations, including in cases of emergency the authority to do so without advance notice, including issuance of a grounding order as occurred on September 11, 2001. TSA's enforcement powers are similar to the DOT's and FAA's described above.
International Regulations
When operating in other countries, our airlines are subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or, in the absence of such an agreement, the airlines' operating rights are governed by principles of reciprocity. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of the agreements affecting our international operations. Commercial arrangements such as ACMI agreements between our airlines and our customers in other countries, may require the approval of foreign governmental authorities. Foreign authorities may limit or restrict the use of our aircraft in certain countries. Also, foreign government authorities often require licensing and business registration before beginning operations. Foreign laws, rules, regulations and licensing requirements governing air transportation are generally similar, in principle, to the regulatory scheme of the United States as described above, although in some cases foreign requirements are comparatively less onerous and in others, more onerous. Such authorities have enforcement powers generally similar to those of the U.S. agencies described above.
When we lease aircraft to customers operating in other countries, the aircraft must comply with the aviation authority designated by that country. The European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA") is a regulatory agency of the European Union. 
Data Protection 
There has recently been increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and in other countries. For example, the European Union ("E.U.") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and increases the requirements related to the protection of personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, violations of the GDPR can result in significant fines. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, and are considering data localization laws that would govern the use of data outside of their respective jurisdictions. 
Other Regulations
Various regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over significant aspects of our business, and it is possible that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to the above, other laws and regulations to which we are subject, and the agencies responsible for compliance with such laws and regulations, include the following:

•The labor relations of our airline subsidiaries are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the NMB certain regulatory powers with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions arising under collective bargaining agreements;
•The Federal Communications Commission regulates our airline subsidiaries’ use of radio facilities pursuant to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended;
•U.S. Customs and Border Protection issues landing rights, inspects passengers entering the United States, and inspects cargo imported to the U.S. from our subsidiaries’ international operations, and those operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions;
•The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has authority to impose requirements related to the mitigation of communicable diseases such as requiring masking on aircraft, negative test results, collection of passenger data for contact tracing, quarantine requirements;
•The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services regulations regarding the eligibility of our employees to work in the U.S., and the entry of passengers to the U.S.;
•The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with wage, work conditions and other regulations of the Department of Labor regarding our employees; and
•The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Bureau of Industry & Security ("BIS") of the U.S. Commerce Department, and other government agencies administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy concerns, which may limit our aircraft sale and leasing business activities in and for certain countries.
