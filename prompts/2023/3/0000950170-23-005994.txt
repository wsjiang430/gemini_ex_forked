 Industry Overview
TTM provides a variety of hardware technology solutions, including completely designed and engineered systems, RF microwave/microelectronic assemblies, product lines of RF components, and technologically advanced PCBs.
 TTM’s engineered systems are mostly sold to the aerospace and defense market, primarily tier one subcontractors but also directly to government agencies. Due, in part, to an increasing global threat environment, according to the United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request Overview Book, U.S. defense spending has been growing steadily in the mid-single digit range with the most recent FY 2023 budget expected to grow in the 10% range. In addition, foreign governments, particularly North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members, have pledged to increase their defense spending which will likely drive foreign military sales (FMS) for U.S. defense contractors. Finally, due to modernization priorities, an increased proportion of defense budgets is geared towards defense electronics such as radar, communications, and surveillance. These are the key markets for our engineered systems products.
 TTM’s RF microwave/microelectronic assemblies are also used in complete defense electronic systems and sold to tier one subcontractors. They benefit from increasing electronics in defense programs as well as increased focused on solid state active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar systems. Based on our internal market intelligence, we expect this market to grow faster than the overall defense market as well.
 TTM is also offering several product lines of high-volume commercial RF components. These components are utilized by TTM’s customers to achieve advance signal conditioning in transceiver applications for 5G and other communication systems. Examples of RF components offered are: Hybrid and Directional Couplers, Baluns, Power Dividers, and RF Resistors. All these products are highly

engineered to meet the customers' critical high performance and size requirements. The growth of the 5G transceiver market is expected to exceed the overall telecommunications market growth over the next several years.
PCBs are manufactured in panels from sheets of laminated material. Each panel is typically subdivided into multiple PCBs, each consisting of a pattern of electrical circuitry etched from copper to provide an electrical connection between the components mounted to it. PCBs serve as the foundation for virtually all electronic products, including the electronic components integrated into automobiles, high-end commercial electronic equipment (such as medical equipment, data communications routers, switches and servers) and aerospace and defense electronic systems.
Products designed to offer faster data transmission, thinner and more lightweight packaging, and reduced power consumption generally require increasingly complex PCBs to meet these criteria. By using advanced technology PCB product solutions such as High Density Interconnect (HDI) and Substrate-like PCB (SLP) technologies, circuit densities can be increased, thereby providing for smaller products with higher packaging densities. Furthermore, rigid-flex circuits can be found in small and lightweight end products and other space-challenged electronics packaging applications across all end markets. Some PCB manufacturers also manufacture high performance substrates that serve as the interconnect between integrated circuits (ICs) and the PCB in many advanced electronic products serving a wide variety of end markets. Combined with the engineered systems and assemblies described earlier, we collectively refer to all of these technologies as “advanced technologies,” and they generally have growth rates which are higher than conventional technologies. In addition, most of our markets have low volume requirements during the prototype stage that demand a highly flexible manufacturing environment which later transition to a higher volume requirement during product ramp.
According to estimates in a November 2022 report by Prismark Partners, worldwide demand for PCBs was expected to be $83.3 billion for 2022. Of this worldwide demand for production in 2022, Prismark Partners reports that PCB production in the Americas accounted for approximately 4% (approximately $3.3 billion), PCB production in China accounted for approximately 53% (approximately $44.2 billion), and PCB production in the rest of the world accounted for approximately 43% (approximately $35.8 billion). According to the same report by Prismark Partners, worldwide demand for PCBs is forecast to grow at a 4.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2021 to 2026 driven largely by strong demand for multilayer board market and growth of HDI technology and substrates. Prismark Partners expects PCB demand to slow considerably until the economic situation recovers by late 2023 and into 2024. The PCB market in 2022 benefitted from, among other things, a strong rebound in GDP due to government stimuli and the on-going re-opening of economies stemming from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
 Industry Trends
We believe that several trends impacting the advanced hardware technology design and manufacturing industry will benefit us in the future. These trends include:
 Increasing complexity of electronic products, which requires technologically complex PCBs that can accommodate higher speeds and component densities, including HDI, flexible, and substrate-like PCBs as well as intricately engineered RF components and subsystems as well as completely designed engineered systems.
 Higher demand for reliable product manufactured in the U.S., providing better oversight on sub-tier supply chain materials and controls. In addition, trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have increased the importance of supply chain partners with strong domestic capabilities and manufacturing footprints.
 Increasing use of hardware technology solutions in diverse end markets as advanced electronics enable new capabilities. Many end markets that TTM serves have generally seen or otherwise are seeing a renaissance of growth opportunities due to the implementation of sophisticated electronics. In the defense market, solid-state radar systems referred to as AESA are being adopted in key new defense programs, replacing legacy mechanical systems. Also, the proliferation of sensors, data, data processing, and communications within the operational environment drives significant growth in sophisticated electronic components as well as integrated systems. In the medical end market, remote diagnostic systems and robotics are seeing increasing adoption. In networking, investments in 5G infrastructure and advanced networking are seeing demand for more advanced PCBs, supporting an ever connected world. Finally, in the automotive market, an increasing trend toward sophisticated safety systems, automated driving, electric/hybrid vehicles, connectivity and miniaturization of electronic devices is driving increasing electronic content and higher PCB usage in automobiles, particularly with regard to the increased demand for advanced technologies like HDI, and RF PCBs for radar and sensor applications.
Supply chain consolidation by commercial OEMs. We believe that technology solution providers that can offer one-stop manufacturing capabilities — from prototype to volume production — and integration capabilities have a competitive advantage in the market.
Our Strategy
 Our vision is to inspire innovation as a global preeminent technology solutions company. Our core strategy includes the following elements:
 Provide differentiated capabilities beyond the base PCB by incorporating advanced design-to-specification engineering support, testing, components and specialized assembly into the value-added solution provided to customers. With the acquisition of Anaren in 2018, TTM moved beyond build-to-print manufacturing and assembly capabilities to engage with customers in designing a more complete RF solution to meet their technology needs. As a result of the additional design capabilities that stemmed from the acquisition, TTM provides cost effective, ready for manufacture, enabling technologies to the customer. With the acquisition of Telephonics in June 2022, we continue to build on the Anaren acquisition to expand into integrated systems, and deepen our RF and radar related engagement with key aerospace and defense customers.
 Maintain our customer-driven culture and provide superior service to our customers in our core markets of aerospace and defense, automotive, data center computing, medical/industrial/instrumentation, and networking. Our customer-oriented culture is designed to achieve extraordinary service, competitive differentiation, and superior execution. Our customer-oriented strategies include engaging in co-development of new products, capturing new technology products for next generation equipment, and continuing investments to enhance our broad offering of PCB and RF/microwave technologies from components through integrated mission systems. We have invested in and employ a diverse group of design engineers and field application engineers (FAEs) to provide technical expertise to our customers with the goal of designing the best product and service solutions for their needs, and to provide ongoing technical support. We believe our ability to anticipate and meet customers’ needs is critical to retaining existing customers and attracting leading companies as new customers.
Drive operational efficiency and productivity. We are highly focused on improving our operational execution to increase efficiency, productivity and yields. We strongly believe in the benefits of sharing best practices across our extensive manufacturing footprint and rely on stringent goals for throughput, quality and customer satisfaction to measure our effectiveness. The fast-paced nature of our business requires a disciplined approach to manufacturing that is rooted in continuous improvement.
Accelerate customer, end-market, and technology diversification through strategic mergers and acquisitions. We have a history of executing successful acquisitions that have been key to our growth and profitability. Historically, we focused on strategic opportunities that could facilitate our efforts to further diversify into other growing end markets. Now that we have a well-diversified end market mix, our focus is to expand our presence in our existing end markets, particularly aerospace and defense which has long product and program lifetimes. We will also look for strategic opportunities that further strengthen our leading-edge technology capabilities. For example, the acquisition of Anaren in 2018 added critical RF engineering, simulation and integration capabilities, the acquisition of certain assets of i3 Electronics, Inc. (i3) in 2019 allowed us to broaden our technology portfolio for high mix, low volume advanced technology PCBs, and the most recent acquisition of Telephonics in 2022 significantly broadens TTM’s aerospace and defense product offering vertically into highly engineered integrated mission system solutions and horizontally into surveillance and communications markets, while strengthening our position in radar systems.
 Accelerate our expansion into growing markets using our advanced technology as a key point of differentiation. With rising requirements for faster data transmission, shrinking features (i.e., lightweight and thin), and lower power consumption, many PCB designs have migrated to more complex HDI PCBs from conventional multi-layer PCB technologies. This trend began with PCBs used in portable devices such as smartphones and other mobile devices but has become an increasing trend in other end markets, such as automotive, networking, medical, and aerospace and defense. As our customers consolidate their supply chains, our objective is to differentiate ourselves as a strategic supplier with the technology breadth to meet most, if not all, of our customers’ PCB and RF related requirements. In the defense industry, there is growing use of electronics, particularly RF/Microwave technologies to develop AESA radars and other integrated mission systems that demonstrate significant performance improvement over traditional systems.
Address customer needs in all stages of the product life cycle. By providing a one-stop solution, we work to service our customers’ needs from the earliest stages of product design and development through volume production. We believe that by servicing our customers early in the development process, we are able to demonstrate our capabilities and establish an incumbent position early in the product development cycle, which translates into additional opportunities as our customers move into volume production. We believe our expertise is enhanced by our ability to deliver highly complex PCBs to customers in significantly compressed lead times. This rapid delivery service enables OEMs to develop sophisticated electronic products more quickly and reduce their time to market. We believe we will be able to continue to increase customer engagement with customized RF solutions from the concept stage through volume production, which typically results in intensified customer engagement. Further, by providing complete engineered systems, we are working more closely with the end customer, providing them with a more complete final product which also enhances our early engagement.
Deliver consistently strong financial performance and execute on our balance sheet strategy. We aspire to deliver industry-leading financial performance. We expect to achieve this by servicing our customers’ needs in higher-growth end markets in a cost-efficient and effective manner. We believe that this strategy will allow us to generate strong cash flows, which will provide us with the financial flexibility for continued investments for growth and return of capital to shareholders.

Continuously enhance the elements that make TTM an appealing employer. We aim to attract the right employees to TTM who align with our values and desire growth in their professional careers. We believe our employee engagement model, emphasis on communications and inclusion, commitment to career development and talent, and collaborative culture are the top reasons employees embrace TTM. Our ability to retain valued talent while attracting candidates is paramount to our continued human capital strategy.

The TLSI organization works with our customers' technical teams, taking complete responsibility for the ASIC development process, from the initial ASIC specification definition through qualification and volume production, to meet the most stringent customer program requirements. Over 10 million of our ASICs are typically shipped every year.
 Conventional PCBs
A conventional PCB is made from a composite laminate that is metalized with a conductive material such as copper. The PCB is the basic platform used to interconnect components in most electronic products including computers, communications equipment, high-end consumer electronics, automotive controls, commercial aerospace and defense systems and medical and industrial equipment. Conventional PCBs can be classified as single-sided, double-sided and multi-layer boards.
We focus on higher layer count conventional PCBs. A multi-layer PCB can accommodate more complex circuitry than a single-sided or double-sided PCB and as such requires more sophisticated production techniques. The number of layers comprising a PCB often increases with the complexity of the end product. For example, a simple consumer device such as a garage door controller may use a single-sided or double-sided PCB, while a high-end network router or computer server may use a PCB with 30 or more layers.
High density interconnect or HDI PCBs
Our facilities in North America and China also produce high density interconnect (HDI) PCBs, which are PCBs with higher interconnect density per unit area requiring more sophisticated technology and manufacturing processes for their production than conventional PCB products. HDI PCBs are boards with high-density characteristics including micro-sized holes, or microvias (diameter at or less than 0.15 mm), and fine line circuitry (circuit line width and spacing at or less than 0.075 mm) and are fabricated with thin high-performance materials, thereby enabling more interconnection functions per unit area. HDI PCBs generally are manufactured using a sequential build-up process in which circuitry is formed in the PCB one layer at a time through successive drilling, plating and lamination cycles. In general, a board’s complexity is a function of interconnect and circuit density, layer count, laminate material type and surface finishes. As electronic devices have become smaller and more portable with higher functionality, demand for advanced HDI PCB products has increased dramatically. We define advanced HDI PCBs as those having more than one layer of microvia interconnection structure.
Substrate-like PCBs or SLPs
 Substrate-like PCBs (SLPs) represent the next evolution of high end HDI PCBs. SLPs are PCBs with even higher interconnect density per unit area than the traditional advanced HDI PCBs described above requiring an even more sophisticated manufacturing technology adapted from IC substrate fabrication with enhancements to the subtractive and additive techniques of traditional PCBs. This enables fine line circuitry (circuit line width and spacing at or less than 0.03 mm). Demand for this type of high-density circuit is continuing to penetrate the markets of more traditional PCBs. In addition, we now offer an alternative approach to building SLP technology in the United States for lower volume, higher mix commercial and aerospace and defense applications.


Flexible PCBs
Flexible PCBs are printed circuits produced on flexible films, allowing them to be folded or bent to fit the available space or allowing for application movement. We manufacture circuits on flexible substrates that can be installed in three-dimensional applications for electronic packaging systems. Use of flexible circuitry can enable improved reliability and electrical performance, reduced weight and reduced assembly costs when compared with traditional wire harness or ribbon cable packaging. Flexible PCBs can provide for flexible electronic connectivity of an electrical device’s apparatus such as printer heads, cameras, TVs, mobile handsets, and tablets. For some of our flexible PCB customers, we also assemble components onto the flexible PCBs we manufacture.
Rigid-flex PCBs
Rigid-flex circuitry provides a simple means to integrate multiple PCB assemblies and other elements such as display, input or storage devices without wires, cables or connectors, replacing them with thin, light composites that integrate wiring in ultra-thin, flexible ribbons between rigid sections. In rigid-flex packaging, a flexible circuit substrate provides a backbone of wiring with rigid multilayer circuit sections built up as modules where needed.
Since the ribbons can be bent or folded, rigid-flex provides a means to compactly package electronics in three dimensions with dynamic or static bending functions as required, enabling miniaturization and thinness of product design. The simplicity of rigid-flex integration also generally reduces the number of parts and interconnections required, which can improve reliability.
 Rigid-flex technology is essential to a broad range of applications including aerospace and defense, industrial and transportation systems requiring high reliability; hand-held and wearable electronics, such as video cameras and music players, where thinness and mechanical articulation are essential; and ultra-miniaturized products such as headsets, medical implants and semiconductor packaging where size and reliability are paramount.
Custom assemblies
Our assembly facilities produce custom electronic assemblies. Custom electronic assemblies refers to a variety of PCB assemblies such as backplane and mid-plane assemblies, flexible and rigid-flex assemblies and RF assemblies. Each of these assemblies involves mounting electronic components to a printed circuit board and then testing the assembly for electrical continuity.
 IC substrates
IC substrates provide the mechanical support and electrical interconnect used to package ICs (integrated circuits or semiconductors) either in single chip packages or multi-chip modules. IC substrates, also known as chip carriers, are highly miniaturized circuits manufactured by a process largely similar to that for PCBs but requiring the use of ultra-thin materials and including micron-scale features, because they must bridge the gap between sub-micron IC features and millimeter scale PCBs. Consequently, IC substrates are generally manufactured in a clean room environment to ensure products are free of defects and contamination and employ advanced HDI processes and manufacturing approaches used in SLP technology.
 Quick turnaround services
We refer to our rapid delivery services as “quick turnaround” or “QTA”, because we provide custom-fabricated PCBs to our customers within as little as 24 hours to ten days. As a result of our ability to rapidly and reliably respond to the critical time requirements of our customers, we generally receive premium pricing for our QTA services as compared to standard lead time prices.
•Prototype production. In the design, testing, and launch phase of a new electronic product, our customers typically require limited quantities of PCBs in a very short period of time. We satisfy this need by manufacturing prototype PCBs in small quantities, with delivery times ranging from as little as 24 hours to ten days. 
 •Ramp-to-volume production. After a product has successfully completed the prototype phase, our customers introduce the product to the market and require larger quantities of PCBs in a short period of time. This transition stage between low-volume prototype production and volume production is known as ramp-to-volume. Our ramp-to-volume services typically include manufacturing up to a few hundred PCBs per order with delivery times ranging from five to 15 days. 
 Thermal management
Increased component density on circuit boards often requires improved thermal dissipation to reduce operating temperatures. We produce printed circuits with heavy copper cores and both embedded and press-fit coins. In addition, we produce PCBs with electrically passive heat sinks laminated externally on a circuit board or between two circuit boards, as well as PCBs with electrically active thermal cores.
Manufacturing Technologies
The market for our products is characterized by rapidly evolving technology. The trend in the electronic products industry continues to be to implement and develop means to increase the speed, complexity, and performance of components while reducing their size. We believe our technological capabilities allow us to address the needs of manufacturers to bring complicated electronic products to market faster.

To manufacture PCBs, we generally receive circuit designs directly from our customers in the form of computer data files, which we review to ensure data accuracy and product manufacturability. Processing these data files with computer aided manufacturing (CAM) technology, we generate images of the circuit patterns that we then physically develop on individual layers, using advanced photographic and direct imaging processes. Through a variety of plating and etching processes, we selectively add and remove conductive materials to form horizontal layers of thin circuitry, which are separated by electrical insulating material. A multilayer circuit board is produced by laminating together multiple layers of circuitry, using intense heat and pressure under vacuum. Vertical connections between layers are achieved by drilling and plating through small holes, called vias. Vias are made by highly specialized drilling equipment capable of achieving extremely fine tolerances with high accuracy. We specialize in high layer count PCBs with extremely fine geometries and tolerances. Because of the tolerances involved, we employ clean rooms in certain manufacturing processes where tiny particles might otherwise create defects on the circuit patterns. We also use automated optical inspection systems and electrical testing systems to ensure consistent quality of the circuits we produce.
We believe that our highly specialized equipment and advanced manufacturing processes enable us to reliably produce PCBs with the following characteristics:
•High layer count. Manufacturing PCBs with a large number of layers is difficult to accomplish due to the accumulation of manufacturing tolerances and registration systems required. In our PCB reportable segment, we regularly manufacture PCBs with more than 30 layers on a quick-turn and volume basis. 
 •Blind and buried vias. Vias are drilled holes that provide electrical connectivity between layers of circuitry in a PCB. Blind vias connect the surface layer of the PCB to an internal layer and terminate at the internal layer. Buried vias are holes that do not reach either surface of the PCB but allow inner layers to be interconnected. Products with blind and buried vias can be made thinner, smaller, lighter and with higher component density and more functionality than products with traditional vias. 
 •Microvias. HDI technology utilizes microvias, which are small vias with diameters generally less than 0.15 mm after plating. Advanced HDI products may also require the microvias to be fully filled using a specialized plating process so that additional microvia structures can be stacked to form more complex interconnections. These microvias consume much less space on the layers they connect, thereby providing for greater wiring densities and flexibility, and also providing closer spacing of components and their attachment pads. The fabrication of PCBs with microvias requires specialized equipment, such as laser drills, and highly developed process knowledge. Higher end applications in both defense and commercial markets employ microvias to obtain a higher degree of functionality from a given surface area. 
 •Embedded passives. Embedded passive technology involves embedding either capacitive or resistive elements inside the PCB, which allows for removal of passive components from the surface of the PCB and thereby leaves more surface area for active components. Use of this technology provides greater surface area for surface-mounted ICs and better signal performance, as well as increased functionality of products with higher component density. 
 •Fine line traces and spaces. Traces are the connecting copper lines between the different components of the PCB, and spaces are the distances between traces. The smaller the traces and the tighter the spaces, the higher the density of the PCB and the greater the expertise required to achieve a desired final yield performance level. We are able to manufacture PCBs with traces and spaces less than 0.030 mm. 
 •High aspect ratios. The aspect ratio is the ratio between the thickness of the PCB and the diameter of a drilled hole. As the aspect ratio increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to consistently and reliably form, electroplate and finish all the holes on a PCB. In production, we are able to provide aspect ratios of up to 30:1. 
 •Thin core processing. A core is the basic inner-layer building block material from which PCBs are constructed. A core consists of a flat sheet of material comprised of glass-reinforced resin with copper foil laminated on either side. The thickness of inner-layer cores is typically determined by the overall thickness of the PCB and the number of layers required. The demand for thinner cores derives from the requirements for thinner PCBs, higher layer counts and various electrical parameters. Core thickness in our PCBs ranges from as little as 0.025 mm up to 1.57 mm. 
 •Advanced hole fill processes. Our advanced hole fill processes provide designers the opportunity to increase the density of component placements by reducing the surface area required to place many types of components. In traditional design, components are routed from their surface interfaces through via connections in order to access power and ground connections and the internal circuitry used to connect to other discrete components. Our advanced hole fill processes provide methods to allow for vias to be placed inside their respective surface mount pads by filling the vias with a thermoset epoxy and plating flat copper surface mount pads directly over the filled hole. 


•Advanced materials. We manufacture circuit boards using a wide variety of advanced dielectric materials. These high-performance materials offer electrical, thermal, and long-term reliability advantages over conventional materials but are more difficult to manufacture. We are certified by Underwriters Laboratories to manufacture PCBs using many types and combinations of these specialty materials. This broad offering allows us to manufacture PCBs for a wide array of end-use applications, including highly complex PCBs for niche and high-end commercial and aerospace and defense markets. 
 •Quick Turn Manufacturing. In addition, in circumstances where our customers require time critical engineering and manufacturing services, we are able to meet our customers’ need with our quick-turn manufacturing capabilities. 
 Our Integrated Electronics Manufacturing organization principally designs and manufactures state-of-the-art microwave-based hardware for use in advanced radar systems, advanced jamming systems, missiles and decoys, electronic surveillance systems and satellite and ground-based communication systems.

All parts are electrically tested for performance and subjected to environmental testing as required.
 •Ceramic Technology. Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) circuits are well-suited for high performance RF packages for multi-function applications such as transmit-receive modules or other RF integrated modules. We developed proprietary processes to allow for the use of less expensive conductors (Silver vs. traditional Gold) in the LTCC product thus providing significantly lower cost options to our customers. We developed a proprietary etched thick film process resulting in thin film performance at a much-reduced cost. We recently deployed customized equipment to support automated test, visual and electrical inspection, and final tape-and-reel for ceramic resistor products significantly reducing cost and enhancing product quality.

 See table in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the percentage of our net sales in each of the principal end markets we serve.
 Sales attributed to OEMs include sales made through EMS providers and ODMs. Although our contractual relationships are often with the EMS or ODM companies, we typically negotiate price and volume requirements directly with the OEMs. In addition, we are on the approved vendor lists of several of our EMS providers. This positions us to participate in business that is awarded at the discretion of the EMS provider.
Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on building long-term relationships with our customers’ engineering and new product introduction personnel early in the product development phase, frequently through strategic account management teams. Traditional build-to-print opportunities involve TTM engineering providing design for manufacture reviews and making recommendations for both manufacturability and cost reductions without impacting specifications. Prototype builds to verify design ensue, along with the early stages of production. As the product then matures from the prototype stage to volume production, we shift our focus to the customers’

procurement departments in order to capture sales at each point in the product’s life cycle. Our design-to-specification capabilities allow us to engage at the onset in the engineering cycle at critical aerospace and defense, automotive, telecommunications, and networking customers as they begin the process of specifying system requirements. At that stage, we support our customers by designing a solution as well as providing early prototyping and test support for that solution. TTM will then meet the ramp to volume production requirements of our customers. Building upon this strategy and moving further vertically along the customer value chain, we also design and manufacture highly-engineered integrated mission systems for aerospace and defense applications.
 Our staff of engineers, sales support personnel, and managers assist our sales representatives in advising customers with respect to manufacturing feasibility, design review, and technological capabilities through direct communication and visits. We combine our sales efforts with customer service personnel at each facility to better serve our customers. Each large customer is typically assigned an account manager to coordinate all of the Company’s services across all of our facilities. Additionally, the largest and most strategic customers are also supported by select program management and engineering teams. Our global sales force is comprised of direct sales personnel, complemented by commission-based independent representatives, and supports customers throughout North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
Our North America footprint includes facilities from our PCB and RF&S Components reportable segments with nineteen PCB fabrication and engineered system plants located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Ontario, Canada; and one RF component plant located in New York.
 Our China footprint includes facilities from our PCB and RF&S Components reportable segments. We have six PCB fabrication plants located in Hong Kong, Huiyang, Dongguan, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Zhongshan, China; and one RF component plant located in Suzhou, China.
 We are opening a new highly automated PCB manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia. We expect the facility to be operational in late 2023.

Suppliers
The supply chain for our different product areas is meaningfully different. For PCBs, primary raw materials are copper-clad laminates and chemicals, while for engineered systems, RF components and subsystems, primary raw materials are components such as circuit card assemblies, PCBs, semiconductors, and connectors.
 The primary raw materials we use in PCB manufacturing include copper-clad laminate, chemical solutions such as copper and gold for plating operations, photographic film, carbide drill bits, and plastic for testing fixtures. Although we have preferred suppliers for some raw materials used in the manufacture of PCBs, most of our raw materials are generally readily available in the open market from numerous other potential suppliers.
The primary raw materials we use in engineered systems, RF components, RF subsystems, backplane assemblies and other PCB assemblies are manufactured components such as PCBs, ceramic and ferrite substrates, connectors, capacitors, resistors, diodes and integrated circuits, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers’ approved vendors. The more complicated RF subsystems may require us to purchase integrated sub-assemblies and super-components such as RF oscillators, frequency converters, power supplies and microprocessors. These components for backplane assemblies and other PCB assemblies in some cases have limited or sole sources of supply. For example, in some instances, our customers will require us to use a specific component from a particular supplier or require us to use a component provided by the customer itself, in which case we may have a single or limited number of suppliers for these specific components. The backplane assemblies, PCB assemblies and precision metal fabricated chassis and enclosures produced by us may be incorporated into a fully integrated and tested system delivered to our customer. These products often incorporate procured power, thermal, interconnect and mechanical components sourced from the customer directed or our selected suppliers.
 Radar, Communication and Surveillance systems use highly sophisticated electronic sub-assemblies including Transmitter and Receiver CCA’s/Modules, Travelling Wave Tube Assemblies, Exciters, Wave Form Generators and Frequency Generators. Many of these systems also require the acquisition of RF antenna arrays, illuminated panel subassemblies, inertial navigation/GPS subassemblies from OEM’s or parts specifically designed for certain applications. The material for these systems come from a variety of sources, including OEMs and Contract Manufacturers, and are often defined by the end customer.
We typically use just-in-time procurement practices to maintain our raw materials inventory at low levels and work closely with our suppliers to obtain technologically advanced raw materials. In addition, we periodically seek alternative supply sources to ensure that we are receiving competitive pricing and service. Certain raw materials, particularly semiconductors continue to be in short supply and are limiting production of some of our engineered systems while other raw materials for PCBs and subassemblies are in adequate supply now. Supply for PCB materials can vary over time depending on supply/demand dynamics for key raw materials such as copper clad laminates. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for more details.
Competition
For PCBs, competitors are mostly based in China and Taiwan. For engineered products such as RF sub-assemblies and systems, we compete with a different set of competitors largely based in the U.S. and Europe. The PCB industry remains fragmented and characterized by intense competition. There are several competitive factors our customers consider when choosing their supplier including, but not limited to, technical capabilities, pricing, service, support, reliability, quality production and location. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include AT&S (Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik Aktiengesellschaft), Chin-Poon Industrial Co., Ltd., Gold Circuit Electronics Ltd., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Sanmina Corporation, Shennan Circuits Co., Ltd., Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Tripod Technology Corporation, Unimicron Technology Corporation, WUS Printed Circuit Co., Ltd., and Zhen Ding Technology Holding Ltd. Our competition for RF products and engineered systems include BAE Systems plc, Cobham plc, Crane Aerospace & Electronics, Elta Systems Ltd., Hendsolt AG, Mercury Systems, Inc., RN2 Technologies Co., Selex ES (subsidiary of Leonardo S.p.A.), Smiths Group plc, and Thales Group.
 We believe that our key competitive strengths include:
Leading global technology solutions manufacturer. We are one of the largest technology solutions manufacturers in North America, one of the largest suppliers to the aerospace and defense industry and have a global sales and manufacturing presence. Historically, we have focused on manufacturing PCBs, but we have been moving further up our customers’ value chain by designing and manufacturing RF sub-assemblies and engineered systems. We are one of the largest and most diversified PCB manufacturers in the world and enjoy significant economies of scale, with net sales of approximately $2.5 billion for fiscal 2022. This scale has helped us invest both organically and inorganically to provide more technology solutions to our customers. The PCB industry is highly fragmented with the top 40 PCB providers comprising approximately 75% of market share based on 2021 revenue, according to Prismark Partners. As our customers consolidate their supply base, we offer the technology breadth and scale to emerge as a preferred partner.
Breadth of technology and products. We offer a wide range of engineered systems, passive RF components, advanced ceramic RF components, hi-reliability multi-chip modules, beamforming and switching networks, integrated circuit (IC) substrates and PCB and RF products, including HDI PCBs, conventional PCBs, flexible PCBs, rigid-flex PCBs, and custom assemblies. We also offer certain value-added services to support our customers’ needs. These include RF design to specification capability, design for manufacturability (DFM), PCB layout design, simulation and testing services, and QTA services. By providing these value-added services to customers, we are able to provide our customers with a “one-stop” technology solution, which we believe enhances our relationships with our customers.
Diversified business model. Our sales are diversified by a well-balanced portfolio of end markets which we serve and by the customers we sell to within those end markets. We believe this diversity reduces our exposure to, and reliance on, any single end market or customer. We enjoy a large and diverse customer base with over 1,500 customers, as well as long-term relationships in excess of ten years with our ten largest customers. Furthermore, for fiscal 2022, our five largest customers were not concentrated in any single end market, but rather represented three of our end markets.
Focused on attractive end markets with a favorable growth outlook and dependence on sophisticated product capabilities. We believe that our global manufacturing footprint and breadth of capabilities enables us to serve multiple key end markets for our technology solutions. The aerospace & defense industry in particular provides an opportunity for us as we combine our traditional market strength in core PCB technology with the advanced technologies and RF capabilities and engineered systems we offer for growing requirements in both traditional and AESA radar systems for defense applications.
One-stop solution for customers. We are capable of providing a one-stop design, manufacturing and test solution to our customers with design services, engineering support and prototype development through final volume production around the globe. This one-stop solution allows us to better serve our customers, many of whom are based in time-critical high growth markets, enabling our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market. We utilize a facility specialization strategy in which each customer is directed to the facility best suited to the customer’s product type, delivery time, complexity and volume needs. This enables us to reduce the time from order placement to delivery. As our commercial customers ramp to volume, we are positioned to transition them to one of our volume facilities in China.
Leading aerospace and defense supplier. We have passed OEM and government certification processes, and administrative requirements associated with participation in government and commercial aerospace programs. When supplying various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, we are required to maintain facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Along with supply of traditional and RF PCBs, we offer a variety of RF components and sub-assemblies, engineered systems, as well as our engineering services and assembly capabilities which allow us to bring additional value to our customers.
Seasonality
We tend to experience modest seasonal softness in the first and third quarters due to holidays and vacation periods in China and North America, respectively, which limit production leading to stronger revenue levels in the second and fourth quarters.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property strategy remains deliberate and aimed at protecting the innovations critical to TTM’s business and the success of our customers and partnerships. We now have a total of more than 150 patents, with approximately 30 pending patent applications. Many of these patents stem from our 2018 acquisition of Anaren, 2019 asset and technology acquisition from i3, and 2022 acquisition of Telephonics. Our PCB business depends on the effectiveness of our fabrication techniques, proprietary PCB structures, and our ability to continually improve our manufacturing processes. We rely on the collective experience of our employees in the manufacturing process to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies available within our industry. In addition, we depend on robust training, recruiting, and retention of our employees, who are required to be knowledgeable in the operation of advanced equipment and complicated manufacturing processes. In regards to our RF products, the vast majority are proprietary and protected or covered by approximately fifty-eight patents and thirteen currently pending patent applications directed towards products for both the wireless infrastructure and aerospace and defense markets.
 National Security Matters
A portion of our business consists of manufacturing defense and defense-related items for various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which requires that we maintain facility security clearances under the NISPOM. The NISPOM requires that a corporation with significant foreign ownership maintaining a facility security clearance take steps to prevent foreign control or influence, referred to as “FOCI.” In February of 2023, our Board of Directors passed a Special Board Resolution (SBR), replacing the Special Security Agreement (SSA) that we entered into with the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) in 2010. The replacement of the SSA with the SBR is a result of the significantly reduced foreign ownership of TTM. The effective date of the SBR is February 2, 2023. The SBR codifies the maintenance of the Government Security Committee of the Board to oversee our compliance and cybersecurity efforts and to put into place best practices in our facilities in the U.S. and overseas to insure that we maintain robust security practices and policies as we serve the interests of our customers in the Aerospace and Defense market. Our Government Security Committee of our Board of Directors, consists of at least 3 Board members that hold a National Security Clearance. The DCSA will continue to review TTM’s compliance with the terms of the SBR annually at each of TTM’s sites which operate under a U.S. DoD security clearance. In addition, all of TTM’s Board is currently comprised of U.S. citizens and per the terms of the SBR, in the future, no foreign citizen will be allowed to sit on TTM’s Board.
 Other Governmental Regulations
Our operations, particularly those in North America, are subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements relating to export control, environmental compliance, waste management, and health and safety matters. In particular, we are subject to the following:
•U.S. Department of State regulations, including the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and ITAR located at 22 CFR Parts 120-130; 
 •U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) located at 15 CFR Parts 730-744; 
 •Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) regulations located at 31 CFR Parts 500-599; 
 •U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state OSHA and Department of Labor laws pertaining to health and safety in the workplace; 
 •U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations pertaining to air emissions; waste water discharges; and the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing processes; the reporting of chemical releases to the environment; and the reporting of chemicals manufactured in by-products that are beneficially recycled; 
 •Department of Homeland Security regulations regarding the storage of certain chemicals of interest; 
 •corresponding state laws and regulations, including site investigation and remediation; 
 •corresponding U.S., county and city agencies; 
 •corresponding regulations and agencies in China for our Chinese facilities; 
 •material content directives and laws that ban or restrict certain hazardous substances in products sold in member states of the European Union, China, and other countries and jurisdictions; 
 •SEC rules that require reporting of the use of certain metals (conflict minerals) originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 9 countries surrounding it pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and 
 •reporting requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 that requires reporting on efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in retailers’ and manufacturers’ supply chains. 
 The process to manufacture PCBs and our other products requires adherence to city, county, state, federal, and foreign environmental laws and regulations regarding the storage, use, handling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes and other hazardous

materials, as well as compliance with wastewater and air quality standards. We believe that our facilities in the United States and Canada comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. In China, the government has a history of changing legal requirements with minimal notice. We believe that our facilities in China comply in all material respects with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have resources in place to maintain compliance to them. The capital expenditure costs expected for environmental improvement initiatives are included in our annual capital expenditure projections.
Human Capital
 How we manage and leverage our human capital is essential in executing our strategy. At TTM, we believe a key differentiator is our culture, which has been shaped through considerable thought and energy. Our culture has served us well as we integrate acquired companies and optimize our organizational structures and teams to better serve our customers. The following elements underpin our culture:
 •Vision – Inspire innovation as a global preeminent technology solutions company.
 •Mission – Provide customers with market leading, differentiated solutions and an extraordinary customer experience.
 •The “TTM Values” that apply to all employees are: Integrity, Teamwork, Clear Communication and Performance Excellence.
 •Our people leaders are guided by our “Leadership Principles” which are: Communications, Collaboration, and Career Development.
 • “One TTM” – embodies our collective “team” approach to solving problems, working together, robust collaboration, and proactive communication throughout the organization to better serve our customers.
 Commitment to Values and Ethics. The foundation of TTM’s strategic vision is its corporate culture and its way of doing business with integrity, teamwork, clear communication, and performance excellence. We seek to demonstrate the importance we place on these values through our goal setting and performance management process as well as providing ethics training to employees every year.
 Along with the TTM Values and our Leadership Principles, we discuss and act in accordance with, and provide annual training for, our Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations and provides guidance for our employees. Our Code of Conduct includes topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. Our Code of Conduct reinforces the importance of fostering an open, welcoming environment in which all employees have a voice and a confidential outlet to raise concerns regarding potential violations.
 Our commitment to our communities is demonstrated through our volunteer efforts, charitable donations, and sponsorships. As an employer, our local sites choose the organizations to affiliate with that best reflect our values.
 In 2021, the TTM Board of Directors established the TTM Chair for Community Service Award to recognize one outstanding team for their contributions to the local community during the year. We host the winning external organization along with the TTM employees and executive leaders in an annual awards ceremony. In 2021, we honored the Dana Farber Cancer Fund and in 2022, we selected Long Island Cares – The Harry Chapin Food Bank and made sizable donations to both that coincided with the United Nations Volunteer Day.
 Talent Development & Acquisition. Talent development is a collective and continuous effort of all of our people managers. We engage in regular talent reviews to calibrate on performance, potential, development gaps and progress, and to evaluate the depth and strength of our integrated succession plans. Our approach to learning is a continuous one, regardless of experience level or tenure. We extend leadership development programs with individually tailored development plans anchored in dedicated coaching and separate internal mentors. To ensure focus on individual development for growth and readiness for career opportunities, we track the completion of development plans of our employees in the management, technical, and professional career tracks, with over 75% documented plans in 2021. Additionally, we extend competency-based training, sponsor job rotations, and form project teams comprised of emerging talent. We provide tuition reimbursement assistance, as well as a monthly stipend to engineers to pay down student debt. Our global learning management system houses extensive internal content as well as select external materials for all to access. Our annual summer technical internship program in North America and now Asia continues to be a success in evaluating technical talent for full time positions. In 2022, we hosted over 100 interns in our factories around the globe and have extended offers of employment to most. We are designing our third Hi Potential leadership development program for 2023 which is an interactive, immersive program customized for TTM by the Center for Creative Leadership. To develop and ready our operations leaders for General Manager positions, we designed and run an internal Operations Leadership Program.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce that reflects the communities that we serve. Our US workforce is approximately 41% ethnically diverse and comprised of nearly 36% females. In addition, 45% of our US new hires in 2022 identified as underrepresented minorities. As part of our efforts, TTM’s Inclusion Council works collaboratively across the organization to drive our DEI strategy and support key initiatives. The Council’s 30 members have formed four committees: Diversity Candidate Pipelines, Employee Experience, Training & Career

Development, and Branding & Communications. The diversity pipeline team will serve as an advisory body to our Manager of Talent Acquisition Programs who is responsible for diversity, military and university hiring. Our sites actively participate in campus hiring and job fairs throughout the year, supporting various events within each region and driving recruitment campaigns that leverage our social media platforms; this is in addition to specific campaigns dedicated to diversity and veteran hiring. We have also expanded and continue to develop our existing policies and training to address harassment, bullying and the elimination of bias in the workplace. In 2021, we partnered with Morgan State University (A Minority Serving Institution) to extend four TTM scholarships to minority engineering students. We have plans to extend partnerships to additional schools in 2023. We delivered valuable DEI learning sessions to our North America leadership teams in addition to publishing internal magazines that feature employees and their personal stories. Building on our early sessions, we are delivering content on building inclusive teams to all people leaders across the globe.
 Employee Engagement & Turnover. We periodically survey our employees and benefit from favorable participation rates to identify and act on specific opportunities to enhance our work environment, improve communications, and strengthen the connection between supervisors and employees. In 2022, we deployed a full-scale engagement survey on 14 engagement drivers with 94% participation rate globally. TTM’s overall engagement survey results indicated High Performing (compared to benchmark) in all 14 drivers, with Culture and Inclusion registering the highest scores. The voice of our employees provide valuable insights on how we invest in people and prioritize specific actions and programs to attract and retain talent. We have shared the results with our employees and gathered additional insights as we develop action plans to address specific areas in 2023.
 To further gauge talent attraction and the onboarding experience, we deployed a new hire survey to gather insight into our employee’s experience from the moment they first interact with TTM as a candidate to settling into their first couple of months in their new role.
 Our two regional change agent networks (Asia and North America) exist to improve communications from the factory and office floor up to the senior management team. We select several employees within each site who are respected, influential and representative of the employee base to serve as change agents. This network discusses and then communicates the key initiatives within the sites in addition to raising employee concerns. Additionally, these teams prioritize site initiatives around community activities, site improvement projects, recognition programs, and new communication methods.
 We review employee turnover rates paying particular attention to supervisor and technical retention. We believe the emphasis we place on selecting, training and coaching supervisors positively impacts their ability to lead people. Our leadership principles of communications, collaboration and career development are designed to improve the employee experience and strengthen working relationships. Through internal surveys, it is clear our employees value their relationships with their supervisors, career opportunities and the corporate culture.
 Compensation and Benefits. We continually review our compensation and benefits programs to attempt to ensure we are in line with market conditions. In 2022, we completed a global job alignment and compensation review for all employees. We made significant investment in our employees’ total cash compensation for competitive reasons while outlining career tracks and levels. Our people leaders spoke with each employee to explain the career framework, their compensation, and potential for future jobs. The adjustments we made to base salaries and incentive compensation, coupled with the conversations on career opportunities from managers, have been very well received. Impacts of this project:
 •Established a globally integrated job architecture that is adaptable for future acquisitions; 
 •Generated compensation adjustments that, on aggregate, brought us closer to the median across all Job Families in total cash compensation; and 
 •Improved our ability to recruit and hire North America talent: 30% applicant flow increase from Q1 2021 to Q2 2022 and overall in 2022, a 43% increase in applicants.
 We still conducted our annual performance review cycle and subsequent salary increases separate from the aforementioned market adjustments. In addition to competitive wages, all employees participate in one of our variable incentive programs, which rewards for performance.
 We also offer comprehensive benefit plans for eligible employees including mental health, employee assistance program (EAP), telemedicine offerings, several medical and dental plans with qualifying employer-funded health savings accounts, life insurance, specialty programs for diabetes and weight loss, wellness challenges, and an on-site health and physical therapy center at our largest U.S. facility.
 Employee Data
 As of January 2, 2023, we had approximately 17,800 employees. Of our employees, approximately 16,100 were involved in manufacturing and engineering, approximately 500 worked in sales and marketing, approximately 300 worked in research and development, and approximately 900 worked in accounting, information systems and other support capacities. Of our 6,100 U.S. employees, 55 are represented by unions. In China, approximately 10,700 employees are members of the All-China Federation of Trade

Unions and accordingly are considered to be represented by a labor union. We believe that our relations with both our union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
