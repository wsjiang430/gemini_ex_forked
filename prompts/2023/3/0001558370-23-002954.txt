BUSINESS
Overview
We are an innovative life sciences technology company delivering spatial biology solutions focused on transforming discovery and clinical research. Our mission is to deliver a revolutionary new class of spatially derived biomarkers that empower life sciences researchers to better understand disease and clinicians to improve patient outcomes. Spatial biology refers to a rapidly evolving technology that enables academic and biopharma scientists to detect and map the distribution of cell types and biomarkers across whole tissue samples at single-cell resolution, enabling advancements in their understanding of disease progression and patient response to therapy. Through our PhenoCycler™ (formerly CODEX®) and PhenoImager™ (formerly Phenoptics™) platforms, reagents, software and services, we offer end-to-end solutions to perform tissue analysis and spatial phenotyping across the full continuum from discovery through translational and clinical research.
Our spatial biology solutions measure cells and proteins by providing biomarker data in its spatial context while preserving tissue integrity. Biomarkers are objective measures that capture what is happening in a cell or tissue at a given moment. Current genomic and proteomic methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), single-cell analysis, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, are providing meaningful data but require the destruction of the tissue sample for analysis. While valuable and broadly adopted, these approaches allow scientists to analyze the biomarkers and cells that comprise the tissue but do not provide the fundamental information about tissue structure, cellular interactions and the localized measurements of key biomarkers. Furthermore, current non-destructive tissue analysis and histological methods provide some limited spatial information, but they only measure a minimal number of biomarkers at a time and require expert pathologist interpretation. Our platforms address these limitations by providing end-to -end solutions that enable researchers to quantitatively interrogate a large number of biomarkers and cell types across a tissue section at single-cell resolution. The result is a detailed and computable map of the tissue sample that thoroughly captures the underlying tissue dynamics and interactions between key cell types and biomarkers, a process now referred to as spatial phenotyping. We believe that we are the only business with the breadth of platform capabilities that enable researchers to do a deep exploratory and discovery study, and then further advance and scale their research through the translational and clinical phases, leading to a better understanding of human biology, disease progression and response to therapy.
We offer complete end-to-end solutions for spatial phenotyping, designed to serve the unique needs of our customers in the discovery, translational and clinical markets. The PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX), is an ultra-high parameter and cost-effective platform ideally suited for discovery high-plex research. The PhenoImager platforms (formerly Phenoptics), which includes the newly introduced Fusion instrument and HT instrument (formerly Vectra Polaris), provide high-throughput with the automation and robustness needed for translational and clinical applications. Furthermore, the PhenoCycler and the PhenoImager Fusion can be integrated into a combined system, the PhenoCycler-Fusion System, to enable spatial discovery at scale by providing significant improvements in the speed of the workflow. Together the systems offer seamless and integrated workflow solutions for our customers, including important benefits such as flexible sample types, automated sample processing, scalability, comprehensive data analysis and software solutions and dedicated field and applications support. With these platforms, our customers are performing spatial

phenotyping to further advance their understanding of diseases such as cancer, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and many other therapeutic areas.

​
Our co-founder and director, Dr. Garry Nolan, originally developed our CODEX technology (now rebranded as PhenoCycler) to better identify biomarkers in discovery research while leading a team at Stanford. We license certain patents, know-how and proprietary technology utilized in our PhenoCycler instrument from Stanford. In order to expand our offerings to the translational and clinical markets, we acquired our Phenoptics (now rebranded as PhenoImager) platform in 2018 from Perkin Elmer, Inc. (“PKI”), from whom we license certain patents incorporated into our PhenoImager instruments.
As of December 31, 2022, we have 934 instruments installed across a broad group of customers throughout North America, Asia-Pacific (“APAC”), and Europe-Middle East-Africa (“EMEA”), reflecting an increase of 261% in the number of instrument placements over 2021. Our full set of proprietary reagents, software and services allows us to drive a stream of attractive, recurring and high margin revenue through our installed base, which will grow as we continue to expand our instrument base and implement workflow advancements. We generated total revenue of $74.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and $54.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We incurred net losses of $70.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and $42.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

We believe this incremental software revenue and consumable pull-through will help solidify our solutions with researchers and improve our recurring revenue base and margin profile.
Curation of analysis software partnerships to accelerate discovery by delivering cutting-edge digital pathology and bioinformatics solutions. We are focused on enabling rapid and advanced data analysis and visualization tools that accelerate the timeline from image acquisition to extracting biological meaning. Image and bioinformatics analysis needs differ across the spectrum from Discovery to Translational to Clinical applications, and it is increasingly clear that one analysis solution may not meet the needs of our entire install base. Therefore, we’ve partnered with leading digital pathology and analysis providers to create an ecosystem of leading tools for our customers. The ecosystem includes established digital pathology names like Indica Labs Inc. and Visiopharm A/S, who provide desktop image analysis tools with ML/AI capabilities for both PhenoCycler and PhenoImager data. The ecosystem also includes newer providers like Enable Medicine Inc., who provides a cloud-based platform for high-parametric analysis and data sharing for our PhenoCycler data. The ability to enable artificial intelligence methods will help solve the growing big data challenges associated with spatial biology and enable the accelerated development of even more advanced analysis methods, thereby increasing the speed of collaborations and biomarker discovery across laboratories. The ecosystem of analysis providers for our solutions will help increase further incremental use of our instruments and consumables.
Investment in clinical developments to demonstrate validity. Our collaborations with key opinion leaders in major cancer institutions, universities and large biopharma customers provide us with visibility into our platform’s potential to advance from translational research to true clinical use. The learnings from these institutions directly informs the required platform investments, clinical studies and regulatory strategy necessary to continue this advancement. Partnerships such as those with UCSF, Johns Hopkins and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute help drive the demonstration and validation of the clinical utility of our platform. In partnership with these and other key opinion leaders, we will establish clinical industry standards that further solidify our platform as the go-to clinical spatial biology solution. We plan to pursue the development and publication of data on our approach, similar to the approach taken by industry stakeholders involved in NGS-based tests for targeted cancer therapies. In parallel, through our continued partnership with key biopharma companies, particularly with their immuno-oncology franchises, we hope to establish our platforms as the preferred clinical trial biomarker solution and enable potential companion diagnostic partnerships in the long term. The centerpiece of our biopharma partnerships is our Advanced Biopharma Solutions (“ABS”) lab where we are running clinical trial tissue samples for their clinical trials. We continue to expand the projects within and across top biopharmaceutical companies. The ultimate goal of ABS is to continue to advance these biomarker partnerships from clinical trials to companion diagnostics. By providing our end-to-end workflows to industry leading partners and clinicians and directly participating in validating the clinical utility of our platform through peer-reviewed publications, we will establish an ongoing cadence and pipeline to further improve our workflows and deliver clinical proof points for our sales and marketing teams to accelerate adoption in the clinical diagnostic market.

Industry and Market Opportunity
Genomic analysis techniques have evolved from bulk genomics to single-cell analysis, and proteomic techniques such as mass spectrometry are advancing to provide cutting-edge unbiased approaches. In parallel, there is a growing need in areas such as immuno-oncology for more predictive biomarkers that can accurately predict a patient’s response to therapy. Spatial biology has emerged as a potential answer to these needs and represents one of the next major frontiers in life sciences research. It has become a key area of focus for researchers and clinicians alike as spatial phenotyping is able to measure protein and cellular interactions, while maintaining spatial context within a selected tissue sample. The result is a visual and computable measurement of histological patterns and an in-depth understanding of disease pathology, adding a new dimension of insights from discovery through clinical and translational research. By providing single-cell and subcellular resolution with spatial context within a single platform, researchers are able to achieve an understanding of how even small subpopulations of cells can play pivotal roles in disease pathology and patient outcome. In addition, recent innovations within proteomics have enabled unprecedented identification of novel proteins, expanding the need for spatial biology platforms that can functionally characterize these newly discovered proteins.
While spatial biology has many applications, spanning from early discovery through clinical research, the leading applications today include:

● | Immuno-oncology: profiling of a tumor and its microenvironment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Immunology: supporting sub-specialties such as autoimmune disorders and transplant medicine. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Neuroscience: characterizing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Infectious disease: understanding the underlying biology of infectious diseases and immune response.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developmental biology: understanding tissue differentiation and stem cell biology to inform cell therapy development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dermatology: immunophenotyping atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and similar dermatological conditions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other notable applications: immunology research and broader disease pathology. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spatial biology market sits within a larger life sciences technology market. Within this market, spatial biology is currently estimated to be over $14 billion across the discovery, translational and clinical markets with immediate applications in cancer — especially immuno-oncology — as well as immunology, neurobiology, autoimmune disorders, infectious disease, and more. Each of these specific market segments have unique application and workflow needs and require fit for purpose product offerings. Today, our products and solutions are primarily sold into the cancer discovery and translational markets, representing a $7 billion addressable market.

Single-Cell with Spatial Context
Single-cell analysis enables the unbiased discovery of known and unknown cell types within a sample; it measures gene and protein expression on a cell-by-cell basis by preserving information about the cell of origin for each analyte measured. Adding spatial context to single-cell analysis provides a wealth of information to visualize tissue organization and disease pathology on a molecular level. Spatial phenotyping using multiplex immunofluorescence (“mIF”) allows for efficient mapping of cell-to-cell interactions and expression of key biomarkers across an entire tissue. Therefore, by integrating single-cell (and subcellular) resolution into a spatial context within a single solution, we provide both the “what” and “where” that can lead to critical insights that would otherwise be unattainable.
Pressing Need for more Predictive Biomarkers in Immuno-Oncology
Over the last several years, immuno-oncology has been among the most active therapeutic areas at large pharmaceutical companies with an estimated market size of $60 billion in 2021 and over 5,000 active clinical trials. As a result, there has been a heightened focus and significant investment dedicated to the discovery of predictive biomarkers in immuno-oncology that provide more predictable measures of disease progression and response to therapy in the clinical setting. A recent research study, published in JAMA Oncology in 2019, assessed the probability of current biomarker technologies such as NGS, RNA analysis, standard histology and spatial phenotyping to predict patient response to immuno-therapies and found spatial phenotyping to be the superior method for biomarker analysis. In addition, the technology’s ability to monitor the physiological states of tumor cells over time, while maintaining integrity of the tissue, enables researchers to find correlations to drug resistance and tumor mutations, which could meaningfully facilitate the discovery and development of the next generation of cancer diagnostics and therapies.
Market needs
While NGS and single-cell analysis have led to paramount scientific advances in de-mystifying the genome, and flow cytometry and mass spectrometry have enabled researchers to gain valuable data troves used for improved biomarker analysis, these technologies fail to provide any spatial context to the genes, proteins and cells measured. As a result, there is a clear and unmet need for spatial biology tools in the life sciences research market, from discovery through translational and clinical research. We view the emergence of spatial analysis as largely complementary to current technologies by offering deeper and more contextual insights into the genome, proteome and cellular activity.
Discovery researchers are limited by the tools available within their arsenal. In recent years, the research community has fully embraced single-cell solutions as they have delivered unprecedented insights and facilitated novel medical breakthroughs. However, while single-cell technologies continue to evolve and improve, providing greater insights into cellular makeup and biomarker expression, existing technologies require the full destruction of the tissue and sacrifice all spatial information. Thus, while significant value has been realized from single -cell analysis, spatial phenotyping

promises to be the next-generation biomarker solution aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of biological function and disease pathology through a visual and computable map of histological patterns.
Clinical researchers are facing a lack of predictive biomarkers, particularly in immuno-oncology, which limit successful patient outcomes and efficiency in clinical development and deployment of novel therapies. Although targeted therapies have enjoyed many notable successes — to which NGS has been a key driver of this innovation — there remains a critical need for validated predictive biomarkers in immuno-oncology, which could disrupt the current paradigm for patient care and drug development. While significant efforts are being made in the discovery of more predictive biomarkers in immuno-oncology, there is still an ongoing and recognized unmet need. Just as NGS did for targeted cancer therapeutics, we believe spatial biology solutions will provide the necessary biological understanding and predictive power to further accelerate the field of immuno-oncology. All of our products and solutions sold today are for research use only. For future applications in clinical markets, our products may require FDA approval.
Our Platforms
We offer distinct stand-alone as well as integrated platforms for spatial phenotyping, designed to serve the unique needs of our customers in the discovery, translational and clinical markets. The PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX), is an ultra-high parameter and cost-effective platform ideally suited for discovery high-plex research. The PhenoImager platforms (formerly Phenoptics), which includes the newly introduced Fusion instrument and HT instrument (formerly Vectra Polaris), are provide high-throughput with the automation and robustness needed for translational and clinical applications. Furthermore, the PhenoCycler and the PhenoImager Fusion can be integrated into a combined system, PhenoCycler-Fusion System, to enable spatial discovery at scale. Together the systems offer seamless and integrated workflow solutions for our customers, including important benefits such as flexible sample types, automated sample processing, scalability, comprehensive data analysis and software solutions and dedicated field and applications support. With these platforms, our customers are performing spatial phenotyping to further advance their understanding of diseases such as cancer, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and many other therapeutic areas. We believe through these platforms, we are fulfilling our mission to empower life sciences researchers and clinicians to better understand the onset, advancement, treatment, prevention and monitoring of disease.
PhenoCycler
Our PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX) instrument is a powerful, yet simple, compact bench-top fluidics system that integrates with a companion microscope to automate image acquisition. It provides a comprehensive spatial biology solution, converting our customer’s standard fluorescent microscope into an automated imaging system to produce ultra-high parameter multiplex images capable of providing in situ analysis at the cellular and subcellular scales. With over 300 biobanks around the world today, most of the researchers utilizing these biobanks are using inferior products, limiting discovery and spending valuable resources. Originally developed in the lab of Dr. Garry Nolan at Stanford University, The PhenoCycler instrument uses antibodies conjugated to a proprietary library of oligonucleotides called Barcodes. This enables customizable panels of greater than 70 antibodies to be combined for a single tissue staining reaction.

Not only is PhenoCycler a powerful tool for discovery, it is also highly intuitive and appeals to both novice and experts in the field of tissue analysis. The experimental workflow for PhenoCycler is summarized below.


PhenoImager
For a deeper understanding of disease and patient response to therapy in large scale studies, translational and clinical researchers need a robust and automated spatial biology solutions. Our PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics) platform enables researchers to visualize, analyze, quantify and phenotype cells in situ, in fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) tissue sections, and tissue microarrays (“TMAs”) utilizing an automated and high-throughput workflow. Proprietary multispectral imaging removes autofluorescence background and precisely measures fluorescent values for each biomarker with subcellular resolution, enabling researchers to capture the multiple interactions occurring between key biomarkers and cells. In contrast, inferior solutions on the market lack the necessary ability to precisely isolate and measure the different fluorescence channels due to color bleed. Users of our platform have confidence in the accuracy of the quantified interactions occurring in the biology of the cell. In addition, just as with PhenoCycler

The PhenoImager HT can also scan brightfield slides for downstream analysis, such as traditional DAB IHC, or scan regions of interest across a whole slide with up to 9 colors (8 biomarkers). The fully automated process provides a recorded whole slide scan, meaning no re-scans and eliminating redundant work.

Suppliers and Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing and distribution of our instruments and reagents. We use one contract manufacturer to produce our PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics) instruments, another to produce our PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX) instruments, and a third to produce all reagent kits. The manufacturers procure the majority of materials needed for the finished good production from many different suppliers, with some of those suppliers located in the US and others located outside the U.S. See “Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy — Our third-party manufacturers are dependent upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.”
Distribution to customers generally occurs from the manufacturing location. We manufacture one sub-assembly related to the Phenoptics (now rebranded as PhenoImager) instruments in our Marlborough, MA facility. Inventory is generally held at the contract manufacturer locations, at a third-party warehouse in Massachusetts, or at our warehouse in Marlborough.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 369 employees, including 107 in research and development, 151 in sales, marketing, support, business development, and field service support, 76 in general and administrative and 35 in contract research and manufacturing. None of our United States employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be positive.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters, research and development facilities and manufacturing and distribution centers are located in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Menlo Park, California, where we lease in aggregate approximately 80,968 and 20,675 square feet of space, respectively, under leases expiring between December 31, 2023 and March 1, 2030. We do not own any real property and believe that our current facilities, together with our global headquarters and research and development center, are sufficient to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Competition
The life sciences market is highly competitive. There are other companies, both established and early-stage, that have indicated that they are designing, manufacturing and marketing products for, among other things, tissue analysis, single-cell analysis and spatial analysis. These companies include 10x Genomics, Nanostring Technologies and Fluidigm, each of which has products that compete to varying degrees with some but not all of our product solutions, as well as a number of other emerging and established companies. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces. Other competitors are in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences market which may lead to products that rival or replace our products.
However, we believe we are substantially differentiated from our competitors for many reasons, including our position as a leader in a large and growing market, proprietary technologies, rigorous product development processes, scalable infrastructure and positive customer experience. We believe our customers favor our products and company because of these differentiators.
For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry — Our market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.”

Government Regulation
We do not currently offer any products or services intended to provide clinical diagnostic or health assessment information in relation to individual patients, for use by those patients or their healthcare providers in connection with treatment.
We offer technology, products, and services directly to our customers or on a contractual basis to a broad range of customers in the life sciences industry. Our customers may themselves be directly regulated by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under CLIA, or similar foreign or state regulatory authorities.
We market certain of our products under the FDA exemptions applicable to RUO IVD products. To qualify for this exemption from the otherwise applicable FDA medical device requirements, IVDs must either themselves be in the laboratory research stage of development; or be instruments, systems, or reagents that are labeled for RUO and intended for use in the conduct of nonclinical laboratory research with goals other than the development of a commercial IVD product, i.e., these products are used to carry out research and are not themselves the object of the research. To make clear that these products are exclusively for research purposes, the FDA requires them to include labeling that is prominently placed to state: “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” RUO products include those intended for use in discovering and developing medical knowledge related to human disease and conditions. For example, instruments and reagents intended for use in research attempting to isolate a gene linked with a particular disease may be labeled for RUO when such instruments and reagents are not intended to produce results for clinical use. FDA guidance describes the agency’s position on RUOs, including labeling and distribution expectations to remain consistent with RUO status. FDA has advised that it will evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if it agrees a product is RUO.
In addition, customers may impose contractual requirements relating to, or we may otherwise determine that it is commercially beneficial for us to voluntarily follow, certain regulatory and industry standards such as FDA good manufacturing practices and International Standards Organization (“ISO”) quality or other standards.
In the future we may pursue or play a role in the development of “companion diagnostics,” or perform clinical testing using companion diagnostics. A companion diagnostic is a medical device, often an in vitro diagnostic device, which provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product. The test helps a health care professional determine whether a particular therapeutic product’s benefits to patients will outweigh any potential serious side effects or risks. Companion diagnostics would be subject to a much more significant degree of potential FDA and CMS/CLIA and state laboratory regulation than our current product and service offerings.
Our ABS laboratory located in Marlborough, Massachusetts is CLIA certified. CLIA establishes rigorous quality standards for all laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health. Clinical laboratories must obtain a CLIA certificate based on the complexity of testing performed at the laboratory, such as a Certificate of Compliance for high-complexity testing. CLIA also mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency requirements, intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. Compliance is subject to verification through inspections and audits.
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. Several states additionally require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states.
If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA certification or a state license or permit, the applicable regulatory agency may, among other things, suspend, restrict or revoke the certification, accreditation, license or permit to operate the clinical laboratory, assess civil monetary penalties and impose specific corrective action plans, among other sanctions.

Intellectual Property
Protection of our intellectual property is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technologies, the skills of our employees, and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate and incorporate advances into our products and services. We regard our services and our products, including our reagents, our instruments, and our developed software, as proprietary.
We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual provisions with employees and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. Our patent strategy is to pursue broad protection for key technologies, supplemented by additional patent filings covering conceptual methods, specific aspects of current and proposed products, and forward-looking applications and technological developments, and licensing of certain patent families from third parties. We also engage in strategic analysis of our owned and licensed patent assets and pursue additional patent claims from our existing portfolio that may provide us with market advantages. We do not rely heavily on trade secret protection but do maintain a certain amount of in-house know-how that is not disclosed publicly.
We provide products to customers and commercial and academic collaborators pursuant to agreements with non- disclosure terms and other conditions that impose restrictions on use and disclosure. We further make use of contractual obligations that require our employees, consultants and contractors with access to our proprietary information to execute nondisclosure, non -competition and assignment of intellectual property agreements, to preserve our intellectual property rights. We generally control access to our proprietary and confidential information through the use of internal and external controls that are subject to periodic review.
Our key tissue labeling technology CODEX® (now rebranded as PhenoCycler®) originated in the laboratory of Professor Garry P. Nolan at Stanford, who is a board member. Two families of patents covering this technology are exclusively licensed from Stanford.
The first patent family generally covers the “CODEX 1” labeling technology in which an antibody conjugated to an oligonucleotide barcode binds to a target in a tissue sample, and extension of a primer hybridized to the barcode generates a molecular reporter that emits a detectable fluorescent signal. The patent family covering the CODEX 1 technology includes patents directed to compositions generated by use of the CODEX 1 technology as well as methods of using the CODEX 1 technology. Patents directed to the methods of using the CODEX 1 technology include U.S. patents (expiring in 2034-2036) and European patents (expiring in 2035) in Germany, France, United Kingdom and Sweden. The patent directed to the compositions generated by use of the CODEX 1 technology is a U.S. patent expiring in 2034. The second patent family generally covers the “CODEX 2” labeling technology in which an antibody conjugated to an oligonucleotide binds to a target in a tissue sample, and a second oligonucleotide conjugated to a dye hybridizes to the first oligonucleotide to generate a fluorescent molecular reporter. The patent family covering the CODEX 2 technology includes a U.S. patent directed to methods of using the CODEX 2 technology, which expires in 2037.
Our key tissue imaging technology Phenoptics® (now rebranded as PhenoImager®) originated at Cambridge Research and Instrumentation Inc, (“Cambridge Research”), a company that was later acquired by Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. (“Caliper Life Sciences”). Caliper Life Sciences was subsequently acquired by PKI. We purchased key patent assets covering this technology from PKI, Cambridge Research and Instrumentation and Caliper Life Sciences, Inc., and also licensed certain supplemental patents from PKI, Cambridge Research and Instrumentation and VisEn Medical Inc. Some of the supplemental patents are exclusively licensed and others are non-exclusively licensed.
The PhenoImager® technology is embodied in the Mantra 2 Quantitative Pathology Workstation, the Vectra 3 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System, the PhenoImager® Fusion System, and the PhenoImager® HT Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System, and in the inForm® Tissue software that is supplied as part of these systems and is also available independently. Each of the above systems is a complex combination of imaging
