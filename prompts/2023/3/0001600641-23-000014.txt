Company Overview
We are one of the world’s leading online marketplaces for connecting design lovers with many of the best sellers and makers of vintage, antique, and contemporary furniture, home décor, jewelry, watches, art, and fashion. We believe we are a leading online marketplace for these luxury design products based on the aggregate number of such listings on our online marketplace and our Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”). Our thoroughly vetted seller base, in-depth marketing content, and custom-built technology platform create trust in our brand and facilitate high-consideration purchases of luxury design products online. By disrupting the way these items are bought and sold, we are both expanding access to, and growing the market for, luxury design products.
1stDibs began over two decades ago with the vision of bringing the magic of the Paris flea market online by creating a listings site for top vintage and antique furniture sellers. The quality of our initial seller base enabled us to build a reputation in the design industry as a trusted source for unique luxury design products. Since then, we have strengthened our brand and deepened our seller relationships. We launched our e-commerce platform in 2013 and transitioned to a full e-commerce marketplace model in 2016. As of December 31, 2022, we operate an e-commerce marketplace with approximately 7,300 seller accounts, compared to over 4,700 as of December 31, 2021. The increase in sellers reflects our launch of new seller pricing tiers in January 2022, including a subscription-free tier with higher commission rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had 5.5 million users compared to 4.3 million as of December 31, 2021 and approximately 1.5 million listings, compared to 1.3 million as of December 31, 2021. Users represent non-seller visitors who register on our website and include both buyers and prospective buyers. As of December 31, 2022, we had a seller stock value in excess of $16.0 billion compared to a seller stock value in excess of $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our seller stock value is the sum of the stock value of all available products listed on our online marketplace. An individual listing’s stock value is calculated as the item’s current price multiplied by its quantity available for sale. 
We provide our sellers, the vast majority of which are small businesses, access to a global community of buyers and a platform to facilitate e-commerce at scale. Our sellers use our platform to manage their inventory, build their digital marketing presence, and communicate and negotiate orders directly with buyers. We provide our buyers a trusted purchase experience with our user-friendly interface, dedicated specialist support, and 1stDibs Promise, our comprehensive buyer protection program. We operate an asset-light business model which allows us to scale in a capital efficient manner. While we enable shipping and fulfillment logistics, we do not take physical possession of the items sold on our online marketplace.
The uniqueness, diversity, and high quality of the products on our online marketplace, together with an active marketing effort, have produced a large, global, and growing base of design-loving buyers. Our user-friendly interface, dedicated specialist support, and 1stDibs Promise enable a trusted purchase experience. Despite the growth on the seller and user side, we experienced year-over-year decreases in GMV, net revenue, and certain key buyer metrics as they have been negatively impacted, both directly and indirectly, by macroeconomic factors, including significant capital market volatility, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the changing consumer behaviors as a result, significant housing market volatility, raising interest rates, global economic and geopolitical developments, and inflation; however, these impacts are difficult to isolate and quantify. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had approximately 68,000 Active Buyers, compared to approximately 72,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021. We define Active Buyers as buyers who have made at least one purchase through our online marketplace during the 12 months ended on the last day of the period presented, net of cancellations. We plan to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives, including those discussed below, in order to continue to drive growth on the seller side and be prepared for if and when macroeconomic conditions improve. 
In each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had an on-platform average order value (“AOV”) of above $2,700 and a median order value (“MOV”) of approximately $1,300. We do not focus on AOV or MOV as key metrics in evaluating our business given our priority to make unique, high-end design items across various price points available through our online marketplace. The percentage of Active Buyers who make more than one purchase in any given year has been generally consistent from year to year and comprised of approximately 30% of total Active Buyers in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Highly experienced interior designers, whom we refer to as Trade Buyers, are frequent, repeat purchasers on our online marketplace and accounted for 32% and 29% of our on-platform GMV in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Through our Trade 1st program, we offer these Trade Buyers, who comprise a subset of our buyers, additional benefits such as trade-only personalized support, exclusive trade pricing, and buyer incentives. Our Trade 1st program is a buyer-only program and members do not pay any fees to participate in this program.
As our online marketplace has scaled, we have created powerful network effects, with better supply attracting more buyers and more buyers encouraging high-quality sellers to join and remain on our platform. Once in motion, the flywheel effect of this network enhances both seller and buyer quality, which we believe drives a competitive advantage.
We are driving consumer demand for luxury design products online by providing global access to a traditionally fragmented, local, and offline market. As sellers and buyers of luxury design products gain experience transacting online, we believe our combination of technology, service, and brand positions us to enable and grow this market by providing sellers and buyers the tools and access they need.
Our proprietary technology platform enables a purchase funnel that is more robust and interactive than the conventional e-commerce experience. The discovery and transaction process in our industry is more complex than in most e-commerce categories. Specifically, transacting in unique luxury design products requires the ability for sellers and buyers to exchange messages, negotiate prices, arrange customized shipping support, and pay swiftly and securely through various payment methods. Our platform turns this complex order flow into an easy-to-use process and converts the valuable data we collect from buyers’ browsing and purchase activity into actionable insights for both sellers and buyers. We empower buyers to engage directly with sellers on our platform throughout all stages of a transaction. Our technology and data represent the cumulative experience of 20 years of business activity, and we believe are extremely difficult to replicate.
Our Market Opportunity
We connect sellers and buyers in what has historically been a fragmented and highly localized global market for unique luxury design products. This market has generally operated offline, functioning mostly through independent galleries, boutiques, and auction houses, thereby restricting a seller’s potential buyer audience and limiting a buyer’s product selection. These offline operations create barriers to both new supply and new demand, limiting the market’s overall growth potential.
We created a single online marketplace that consolidates previously fragmented sellers and buyers on a global scale. We believe our online marketplace, powered by our technology platform, has transformed almost all dimensions of the luxury design buying experience by increasing accessibility and enhancing selection and convenience. 
Global Luxury Market
Our core market, including high-quality design furniture and homewares, fine art, and watches and jewelry, was estimated to be approximately $178 billion in 2022, according to Bain & Company. Our platform is built on a scalable infrastructure that allows us to enter adjacent luxury markets and expand our addressable market with minimal additional investment. The personal luxury goods market, as defined by Bain & Company, excluding watches and jewelry, was estimated to total approximately $260 billion in 2022 and includes adjacent categories, such as footwear, leather goods, apparel, and beauty.
Combining our core market of high-quality design furniture and homewares, fine art, and watches and jewelry with the personal luxury goods market (excluding watches and jewelry), results in an estimated total addressable market size of $438 billion as of 2022.
Expanding the Luxury Goods Market
While the global luxury design market is already large, we believe that as a digital disruptor we have the potential to further expand the overall size of our market. We believe we are growing the market by: (1) increasing the number of digital global luxury design sellers by enabling them to transact on a global online marketplace that materially expands their potential customer base; and (2) growing the luxury design buyer base by introducing our online audience to unique products previously only accessible via in-person galleries, boutiques, and auction houses. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we launched new seller pricing tiers, including a subscription-free tier with higher commission rates which increased our seller count to approximately 7,300 from over 4,700 as of December 31, 2021, as well as launched localized sites in Germany and France. Additionally, in November 2021 we introduced 1stDibs Auctions, and for the year ended December 31, 2022 auction orders comprised approximately 5% of total orders. We were able to grow these metrics in the year ended December 31, 2022, despite the macroeconomic issues effecting GMV and net revenue.
As we reinvent how buyers discover and engage with luxury design products, we have found that we are attracting a new and broader audience to our market. We have sold items on our online marketplace ranging from less than $100 to over $1 million, demonstrating that high-end luxury design products are attainable and within reach of the expanding buyer audience we are attracting to the market.
Increasing Online Penetration
One of the most significant trends driving online penetration in the luxury goods market is an increasingly digitally native customer base. Bain & Company estimates that online personal luxury goods purchases will continue to grow, reaching up to 30% of total sales by 2025. According to Bain & Company, Gen-Y and Gen-Z, born during 1981-1995 and 1996-2015, respectively, are expected to account for 65-70% of luxury spend by 2025. Spending by Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha, born during 1996-2015 and kids born after 2016, respectively, will grow three times faster than previous generations, making up one third of purchases in the luxury goods market by 2030. These generations are leading the shift from offline to online commerce and will soon dominate the luxury goods market’s customer base.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, traffic on our website grew 16% from the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, the number of seller accounts grew to approximately 7,300 from over 4,700 as of December 31, 2021. We believe these metrics are proof of the increasing online penetration in the luxury goods market, despite the macroeconomic issues effecting GMV and net revenue. 
The 1stDibs Marketplace
Trust
Trust is at the core of the online marketplace that we have built in over two decades of operating history. Trust in our online marketplace is critical to facilitating online transactions of highly considered purchases with high price points. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, over 20% of our on-platform GMV was generated from orders with an item value above $15,000 and approximately 4% and 3% for orders with an item value of $100,000 or more for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our thorough seller vetting process inspires buyer confidence in our sellers and in the quality of the luxury design products sold on 1stDibs. Extensive fraud protection and secure payment solutions further establish the trust sellers and buyers have in our online marketplace. The ability for buyers to interact and negotiate prices directly with sellers increases both on-platform conversion and buyer retention rate. Our 1stDibs Promise gives our buyers peace of mind with every purchase by providing the following features and commitments:
•A community of thoroughly vetted sellers from around the world to ensure high-quality products;
•Confidence at checkout with multiple secure payment options and a comprehensive fraud protection and prevention program;

•A price-match guarantee to ensure that if a buyer finds a 1stDibs seller that has the same item for a lower price elsewhere, 1stDibs will match it; and
•Enablement of a seamless and transparent global end-to-end shipping, logistics and delivery experience focused on security and a high level of care.
