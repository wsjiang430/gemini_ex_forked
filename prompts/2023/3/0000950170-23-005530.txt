Item 1. Business
Overview
SpartanNash Company (together with its subsidiaries, “SpartanNash” or the “Company”) is a food solutions company that delivers the ingredients for a better life. Its core businesses include distributing grocery products to a diverse group of independent and chain retailers, its corporate-owned retail stores, and U.S. military commissaries and exchanges; as well as operating a premier fresh produce distribution network and the Our Family® private label brand. SpartanNash serves customer locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Djibouti, Korea and Japan. The Company owns and operates 147 supermarkets and shares its operational insights to drive solutions for its food retail independent customers. While the Company supports overseas commissaries and exchanges, all of the Company’s sales and assets are in the United States of America.
 At the beginning of the third quarter of 2022, the Company combined the previous Food Distribution and Military operating segments into one operating segment: Wholesale. The change in the operating segments was driven by both a change in the Company’s organizational structure, and in the reporting utilized by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate the Company’s resources and assess operating performance. The combination of the two segments reflects the way the Company manages the distribution business as one comprehensive network and furthers the Company’s efforts to streamline operations in connection with its supply chain transformation and better serve customers. As a result, the Company now operates two reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail. These reportable segments are two distinct businesses, each with a different customer base, management structure, and basis for determining budgets, forecasts, and compensation. Segment financial information for the comparative prior year periods within this annual report has been recast to reflect this change.
 The Company’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. In this report we discuss information as of and for the fiscal years ending or ended December 30, 2023 ("2023"), December 31, 2022 (“2022” or “current year”), January 1, 2022 (“2021” or “prior year”) and January 2, 2021 (“2020”), all of which include 52 weeks, with the exception of 2020, which includes 53 weeks. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company’s first quarter, which is 16 weeks and usually includes the Easter holiday. As a result of fiscal 2020 containing 53 weeks, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 contained 13 weeks. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year’s holiday.
 The Company’s differentiated business model of Wholesale and Retail operations leverages the complementary nature of both segments and supports the ability of the Company’s independent retail customers to compete in the grocery industry in the long-term. The model produces operational efficiencies, greater visibility and broader business growth options throughout each of the segments.
 SpartanNash has a strategic identity called Our Winning RecipeTM that activates its mission to deliver the ingredients for a better life through a focus on core capabilities, behaviors and strategic priorities. SpartanNash has a keen focus on its core capabilities which include: people, operational excellence and insights that drive solutions. The Company’s vision is seeing a day when its customers say, “I can’t live without them.”
 Wholesale Segment
The Company’s Wholesale segment uses a multi-channel sales approach to distribute national brand and private brand products to independent retailers, national accounts, food service distributors, e-commerce providers, and the Company's corporate owned retail stores. The Company’s Wholesale segment also contracts with manufacturers and brokers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to 160 U.S. military commissaries and over 400 exchanges worldwide. Together with its third-party partner, Coastal Pacific Food Distributors ("CPFD"), SpartanNash represents the only global delivery solution to service the Defense Commissary Agency ("DeCA" or "the Agency"). Total net sales from the Company’s Wholesale segment, including sales to corporate owned retail stores that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, totaled $8.0 billion for 2022. As of the end of 2022, the Company is among the five largest wholesale distributors in the nation in terms of annual revenue. The Company is focused on growth in its Wholesale segment, through expanded relationships with existing customers as well as new business opportunities.
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company operated in all 50 states by leveraging a network of 19 distribution centers, in addition to a facility on the West Coast operated by third-party partner CPFD, as well as internal transportation fleets and third-party shipping partners, servicing the Wholesale segment. The Company’s extensive geographic reach drives economies of scale, provides opportunities for independent retailers to purchase products at competitive prices in order to effectively compete in the grocery industry in the long-term and includes distribution centers strategically located among the largest concentration of military bases the Company serves and near Atlantic ports used to ship grocery products to overseas commissaries and exchanges.

The Company’s Wholesale segment provides a selection of approximately 85,500 stock-keeping units (SKUs) of nationally branded and private brand grocery products and perishable food products, including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, and seafood, as well as floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products, health and beauty care products and pharmaceutical products. These product offerings, along with best-in-class services, allow independent retailers the opportunity to support the majority of their operations with a single supplier. The Company also provides a comprehensive menu of support services designed to assist independent retailers in becoming more profitable, efficient, competitive, and informed, ranging from real estate and site surveys to a full suite of merchandising, marketing, accounting, and information technology solutions.
 The Company also services national accounts through a variety of platforms and has diversified its customer base through growth with these customers. These national accounts partner with the Company to centralize their supply of grocery products or product categories, and to leverage the Company’s broad geographic reach. Sales to one of the Company’s customers in the Wholesale segment accounted for 16%, 17% and 17% of the Company's net sales for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other individual customer exceeded 10% of the Company's net sales in any of the years presented.
 The Company is also the exclusive supplier of private brand products to U.S. military commissaries, a partnership with DeCA which began in fiscal 2017. The current contract to provide DeCA with private branded products extends through December 2025. In accordance with its contract with DeCA, the Company procures the grocery and related products from various manufacturers and upon receiving customer orders from DeCA, either delivers the products to the U.S. military commissaries itself or engages its worldwide strategic business partner, CPFD, to deliver the products on its behalf. The Company is among one of the four largest distributors to the DeCA commissary system, in terms of annual sales, that distributes products via the frequent delivery system. The remaining distributors that supply DeCA tend to be smaller regional and local providers.
DeCA operates a chain of 236 commissaries on U.S. military installations across the world that sells approximately $4.2 billion of grocery products annually. The Company obtains distribution contracts with manufacturers through competitive bidding processes and direct negotiations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately 250 distribution contracts representing approximately 600 manufacturers that supply products to the DeCA commissary system and various exchange systems.
 The Company’s ten largest Wholesale customers (excluding corporate owned retail stores) accounted for approximately 43% of total Wholesale net sales for 2022. Approximately 90% of Wholesale net sales to independent retailers for 2022 are covered under supply agreements with customers.
The Wholesale segment competes directly with a number of traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems. In addition, the Company’s independent customers face intense competition from supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company partners with these customers to help them compete efficiently and effectively. The primary competitive factors in the Wholesale business include price, service level, product quality, variety, reputation with DeCA, location of distribution centers and other value-added services.
 Retail Segment
As of December 31, 2022, the Company operated 147 corporate owned retail stores and 36 fuel centers in nine states in the Midwest, primarily under the banners of Family Fare, Martin’s Super Markets, D&W Fresh Market, and VG’s Grocery. Retail banners and store counts are fully detailed in Item 2, “Properties.” The Company’s corporate owned retail stores range in size from approximately 14,000 to 90,000 square feet, or on average, approximately 44,000 square feet per store.
 The Company’s convenience and community-focused strategy distinguishes its corporate owned retail stores from supercenters and limited assortment stores. This strategy is complemented by e-commerce platforms, including Fast Lane and Groceries to GO, and relationships with DoorDash, Shipt, and Uber Eats, which provide online grocery shopping and curbside pickup or delivery at 142 corporate owned retail locations as of December 31, 2022. These channels are highly valued by customers and continuing to enhance and grow this platform is a key component of the Company’s strategy. The Company makes investments to support its online ordering systems, the speed and convenience of curbside pickup, and the efficiency and completeness of order fulfillment.
The Company’s corporate owned retail stores offer nationally branded and private brand grocery products, as well as perishable food products including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, including store prepared “grab and go” meal options, bakery goods, frozen food, and seafood, as well as floral products, general merchandise, beverages, health and beauty care products and fuel. Sixty-five of the Company’s stores contain franchised Starbucks or Caribou Coffee shops, which enhance the customer experience and help to drive traffic. Private brand grocery products typically generate higher margins while also improving customer loyalty by offering quality products at affordable prices.
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company offered pharmacy services in 91 of its corporate owned retail stores (81 of the pharmacies are owned by the Company) and operated three pharmacy locations not associated with corporate-owned retail locations. The Company believes the pharmacy service offering in its corporate owned retail stores is an important part of the consumer experience. Most of the Company’s pharmacies offer low-cost generic drugs and counseling for preventative health and education for its customers. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations are available in the pharmacies.

The following chart details the changes in the number of corporate owned retail stores over the last five fiscal years:
 
 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 
Number of stores at beginning of year | | 145 | | 139 | | 156 | | 156 | 145
Stores acquired or constructed during year | | — | | 24 | | 1 | | — | 3 
Stores closed or sold during year | | | | | | 1 | | 11 | 1 
Number of stores at end of year | | 139 | | 156 | | 156 | | 145 | 147

 The principal competitive factors in the Retail business include the location and image of the store; the price, quality, variety and value-add of the fresh offering; and the quality, convenience and consistency of service. In addition to competing with traditional grocery stores, the Company competes with supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company monitors planned competitive store openings and uses established proactive strategies to respond to new competition both before and after competitive store openings. Strategies to react to competition vary based on many factors, such as the competitor’s format, strengths, weaknesses, pricing and sales focus.
Supply Chain Network
 The Company’s distribution network is comprised of 19 distribution centers, in addition to a facility on the West Coast operated by CPFD, which are utilized to service the Wholesale segment. The Company warehouses product through approximately 8.9 million square feet of distribution center space. The Company operates a diverse fleet of owned and leased transportation equipment, which includes 570 over-the-road tractors, 253 dry vans and 1,130 refrigerated trailers. In addition, the Company also operates 14 over-the-road tractors, 258 dry vans and 123 refrigerated trailers through short-term rental contracts. The Company carefully manages the approximate 64 million miles driven by its fleet and third-party carriers annually servicing military commissaries, exchanges, independent retailers, national accounts and corporate owned retail stores.
 The Company continues to execute its comprehensive supply chain transformation initiative. The initiative is focused on executing improvements to supply chain operations across the Company’s network, which continues to result in sustained efficiencies and cost reductions. The supply chain initiative is focused on making investments in people, process, and technology to support long-term growth and maximize operational efficiencies. The Company is investing in its workforce through an expansion of its onboarding, training and career development programs, and is working on several initiatives aimed at improving associate engagement, customer experience and overall supply chain performance.
The Company is currently refining its sales and operations planning process and optimizing its network to enable more effective and efficient operations across the supply chain. The Company plans to continue to enhance its inventory management and control policies and procedures, including item assortment decisions, while also developing dynamic slotting capabilities, to improve order selection efficiency and maximize space utilization. Process improvements are also underway in other areas of warehouse operations, including enhanced labor planning tools and analytical capabilities to improve productivity.
System enhancements in the areas of forecasting and replenishment are intended to support the strategic optimization of inventory, allowing for improved service levels and warehouse capacities, while also reducing excess inventory and shrink. The Company believes that its consolidation of transportation management information systems will also streamline operations and reduce miles traveled.
Marketing and Merchandising
During 2022, the Company leveraged data and insights to develop and implement strategies to respond to changes in consumer behavior impacted by the post-pandemic rise of food at home consumption as well as inflation. In 2022, the Company completed extensive market research to gain a better understanding of the meaning, importance, and equity of each retail banner brand. Shoppers revealed deep emotional connections with the Company's retail banner brands, including the feeling of a "hometown" store with hundreds of local products that provide a consistent, positive, and personalized experience.
 The Company’s retail growth strategy is focused on building in-store and digital engagement with shoppers to better personalize offers and highlight local assortment, while increasing customer satisfaction through quality, service and convenience. Key focus areas include improvement in customers’ perception of Company pricing, product assortment and increased penetration of the Company’s private brands. Although value-seeking behavior is increasing, convenient food indulgence in grocery stores is a way in which consumers are shifting away from dining out. Building on the strength of the Company's flagship brand, Our Family®, Fresh & Finest, by Our Family®, a premium fresh brand, was successfully launched in 2022. Additionally, the Company launched the first phase of a merchandising transformation initially focused on enhancing category management, including a new cost policy and better promotions planning. In 2022, the transformation leveraged advanced analytics to enable more customer-led category planning and promotions to benefit corporate retail and independent grocery customers.
 The Company has developed processes to measure the activation of these strategies as well as their impacts. These measures are reviewed continuously to refine and evolve the strategies. The Company will continue to share its best practices across its independent customer base within the Wholesale segment as it gains further insights.

Seasonality
The majority of the Company’s revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, in some geographies, corporate retail stores and independent retail customers are dependent on tourism, and therefore can be affected by seasons. The Company’s revenues may also be impacted by weather patterns.
Suppliers
The Company purchases products from a large number of national, regional and local suppliers of name brand and OwnBrands merchandise. No single supplier accounts for more than 5% of the Company’s purchases. The Company continues to develop strategic relationships with key suppliers and believes this will prove valuable in the development of enhanced promotional programs and consumer value perceptions.
Intellectual Property
The Company owns valuable intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, and other proprietary information, some of which are of material importance to its business.
Technology
In 2022, the Company focused on foundational IT hardware and digitization efforts across all business segments, including the continued transition to Software as a Service (“SaaS”) technology, where production environments are hosted in the cloud.
Supply Chain. The Company continued its transformational effort to replace existing transportation systems, including standardization of processes and rationalization of disparate systems into a single integrated application stack. Additionally, the Company developed process automation improvements as well as data analytic solutions around workforce productivity. These automation and data analytic initiatives, combined with the workforce investments noted previously, are expected to contribute to improved hiring, retention and productivity.
 Retail. The Company continued taking additional steps to modernize its retail applications footprint, which began in 2021 with a comprehensive effort to upgrade and digitize its point-of-sale (“POS”) environment. The upgraded POS application includes an integrated feature set which enhances the retail experience both for SpartanNash and its independent customers.
 Marketing and Merchandising. In 2022, the Company completed its implementation of a cloud-based pricing and promotion automation solution. The new technology provides a vendor portal and aids workflow management for promotional activities, as well as the management of associated vendor billings for all of the Company's customers. In addition, the Company further expanded eCommerce capabilities including integration with leading marketplaces including DoorDash, Shipt, and Uber Eats.
 Administrative Systems, Infrastructure and Security. The Company has implemented tools to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of internal reporting and administrative functions. A centralized cloud-based data analytics solution was implemented to consolidate the Company’s analysis and reporting platforms, which supplies the Company with advanced data analytics capabilities to provide better business insights in real-time. During 2022, the Company also took significant steps to improve its information security. Lastly, the Company made several enhancements to its foundational hardware infrastructure including upgrades to the production storage environment and network servers.
Human Capital
 The success of the Company's strategic direction and its execution begins with its associates, which is why the Company's People First culture is vitally important. For the Company, this means investment in its people is the first investment it makes. As the Company cultivates an environment in which associates can do their best work, it is building the foundation for a thriving business that will last. During 2022, the Company hired a new Chief Human Resources Officer, Nicole Zube, who has a proven background in human capital management.
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 17,500 associates, 10,500 on a full-time basis and 7,000 on a part-time basis.
Retention. Attracting and retaining talent is imperative to achieving the Company's mission of delivering the ingredients for a better life. The Company’s primary initiatives in this area include improving diversity and inclusion in our workforce, ensuring a safe and desirable work environment, maintaining a competitive and compelling total rewards offer and investing in leadership and associate development.
While the rate of turnover remains high, specifically in the retail and distribution environments, the Company has specific engagement plans to further reduce attrition in 2023.
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The Company celebrates diversity and believes employing a diverse workforce where associates can be authentic is key to success. SpartanNash expects all of its associates to reinforce the People First culture to build a diverse and inclusive workplace. As a commitment to this, all associates are required to complete training on Dignity and Respect, Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination. Additionally, during 2022 the Company named a Senior Director of Diversity and Inclusion to oversee the Company’s diversity and inclusion strategic objectives and programs.

The Company's executive leadership team is fully committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace and integrating health and safety into all workplace activities, which is evidenced by the Company's goal to be a leader in every safety category it measures.
 Associate Engagement and Training. The Company believes that engagement and education are key to ensuring the Company's associates provide extraordinary service and expertise. The Company conducted an associate engagement survey of its entire workforce in 2022 to comprehensively solicit feedback. The resulting survey action plans will be used as the basis to further associate engagement efforts in 2023. The Company provides company-wide training on Our Winning RecipeTM when new associates join the Company and role-specific training to ensure operational excellence.

 Compensation and Benefits. The Company’s total rewards programs are designed to provide compensation and benefits packages that will attract, retain, reward, and inspire its associates to achieve a high level of performance. Overall compensation and benefits are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain competitive with respect to industry benchmarks. Significant wage investments were made in 2022 across the retail and supply chain operations to attract and retain associates. Areas of focus for wages included wage improvements for certain entry level roles across all front-line operations and for distribution hourly associates, and to incentivize productivity and to address competitive truck driver pay. Since 2020, the Company has increased retail entry level wages by 30% on average. The Company's incentive programs are designed to align the associates' financial interests with those of shareholders and other stakeholders.
 Environmental Matters

The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations, and in the past has conducted its operations, in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Also, the Company typically conducts an environmental review prior to acquiring or leasing buildings or raw land. However, the Company cannot always control or predict what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its facilities, and future changes in regulations may result in liabilities to the Company or increases in the cost of doing business.
 Regulation
The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the conduct of its business, including those pertaining to its workforce and the purchase, handling, sale and transportation of its products.
