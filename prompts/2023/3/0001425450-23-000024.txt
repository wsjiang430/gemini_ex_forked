ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
OrthoPediatrics Corp. (the "Company") is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana, and organized in November 2007. The Company’s Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol KIDS. OrthoPediatrics Corp. is a medical device company committed to designing, developing and marketing anatomically appropriate implants, instruments and specialized braces for children with orthopedic conditions, giving pediatric orthopedic surgeons and caregivers the ability to treat children with technologies specifically designed to meet their needs. Initially organized as an Indiana limited liability company on August 31, 2006, OrthoPediatrics Corp. was converted to a Delaware corporation on November 30, 2007. We sell our specialized products, including PediLoc®, PediPlates®, Cannulated Screws, PediFlexTM nail, PediNailTM, PediLoc® Tibia, ACL Reconstruction System, Locking Cannulated Blade, Locking Proximal Femur, Spica Tables, RESPONSETM Spine, BandLocTM, Pediatric Nailing Platform | Femur, Devise Rail, Orthex®, The Fassier-Duval Telescopic Intramedullary System®, ApiFix® Mid-C System and Mitchell Ponseti® specialized bracing products to various hospitals and medical facilities throughout the United States and various international markets. We currently use a contract manufacturing model for the manufacturing of implants and related surgical instrumentation while our clubfoot orthopedic products are manufactured in house. 
The Company began selling its products in the United States in 2008 and internationally in 2011. In 2017, we expanded operations and established legal entities in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand, permitting us to sell under an agency model directly to local hospitals in these countries. We began selling direct to Canada in September 2018, Belgium and the Netherlands in January 2019, Italy in March 2020, and Germany, Switzerland and Austria in January 2021. In order to further enhance our operations in Europe, we established operating companies in the Netherlands and Germany in March 2019 and April 2022, respectively. 
The Company routinely explores opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses. For example, in 2020, we acquired Telos, a boutique regulatory consulting firm formed in Colorado, and ApiFix, Ltd., the developer of a minimally invasive deformity correction system for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ("ApiFix System"). In 2022, we acquired MD Ortho, a manufacturer of orthopedic clubfoot products, and Pega Medical, a medical device company which sells a portfolio of trauma and deformity correction devices for children, including the Fassier-Duval Telescopic Intramedullary System designed to treat osteogenesis imperfecta. 
In 2020, we also acquired the intellectual property assets from Band-Lok, LLC, related to its Tether Clamp and Implementation System which we use in connection with our Bandloc 5.5/6.0 System. We were previously the sole licensee of the purchased asset under a license agreement with Band-Lok. Also, we purchased certain intellectual assets and product inventory from Devise Ortho, Inc., related to its Drive Rail external fixation system, which compliments our existing external fixation products. 
In addition to acquisitions, we also look for partnerships which can provide us with complementary enabling technologies. For example, in 2021 we extended our license agreement for our exclusive distribution rights of the FIREFLY® Technology. Also in 2021, we entered into a license agreement resulting in exclusive distribution rights of the 7D Surgical FLASHTM Navigation platform for pediatric applications. These partnerships allow for exclusive distribution in children's hospitals across the United States and serve as supporting avenues for us to focus on high-volume children's hospitals. 
On August 15, 2022, we raised net proceeds of approximately $139.3 million from a public offering of (a) 1,091,250 shares our common stock, and (b) pre-funded warrants exercisable for an aggregate of up to 1,525,000 shares of common stock to Squadron Capital LLC (“Squadron”), our largest investor. The net proceeds reflect the Company’s payment of $4.3 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and $0.3 million in other offering costs. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay $31 million of borrowings previously outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility with Squadron. On September 20, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,525,000 shares of common stock to Squadron upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants. 
Our largest investor is Squadron, a private investment firm based in Granby, Connecticut. 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had consolidated total assets of $427.7 million, consolidated total liabilities of $49.1 million and stockholders’ equity of $378.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries had 203 full-time equivalent employees.
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")
OrthoPediatrics was founded on the cause of impacting the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. Since inception we have impacted the lives of over 630,000 children, when including those served by our acquired companies. We believe we should continue to expand our social efforts while minimizing our impact to the environment and ensuring corporate governance. In 2021, we created an internal ESG team, which reports directly to our Board’s Governance Committee, to identify ESG topics for disclosure by assessing both the impact on our business and the importance to our stakeholders.
We encourage you to review our ESG page and summary report which can be found under the "About" section of our corporate website for more detailed information regarding our ESG efforts and current initiatives. On our website, among other information, are the following highlights:
•OrthoPediatrics cares about our environmental impact while working in a highly regulated industry and we are certified according to ISO 13485. Our team in Warsaw, Indiana recently implemented an enhanced recycling program. 
•The Company and its associates regularly participate in philanthropic causes important to our local communities. We also partner with charitable organizations that provide pediatric orthopedic care around the world. In 2020 we were named as "Corporate Partner of the Year" by the World Pediatric Project - with whom we work to provide access to medical care for children in developing countries. 
•We are committed to fostering an environment that is respectful, compassionate, and inclusive of everyone in our community.
•The Company and its Board of Directors understand the value of diversity. In 2022, the Company added one additional diverse Director and our Board is targeting the addition of another diverse candidate in 2023. 
We believe effectively managing our priorities, as well as increasing our transparency related to ESG programs, will help create long-term value for our stakeholders. We expect to continue to increase our disclosures and communicate our ESG efforts in future SEC filings.

The Company 
We are the only global medical device company focused exclusively on providing a comprehensive trauma and deformity correction, scoliosis and sports medicine product offering to the pediatric orthopedic market in order to improve the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. We design, develop and commercialize innovative orthopedic implants and instruments to meet the specialized needs of pediatric surgeons and their patients, who we believe have been largely neglected by the orthopedic industry. We currently serve three of the largest 
categories in this market. We estimate that the portion of this market that we currently serve represents a $3.9 billion opportunity globally, including over $1.7 billion in the United States.
Historically, there have been a limited number of implants and instruments specifically designed for the unique needs of children. As a result, pediatric orthopedic surgeons often improvise with adult implants repurposed for use in children, resort to freehand techniques with adult instruments and use implants that can be difficult to remove after being temporarily implanted. These improvisations may lead to undue surgical trauma and morbidity.
We address this unmet market need and sell the broadest product offering specifically designed for children with orthopedic conditions. We currently market 46 surgical and bracing systems that serve three of the largest categories within the pediatric orthopedic market: (i) trauma and deformity correction, (ii) scoliosis and (iii) sports medicine procedures. Our products have proprietary features designed to:
•    protect a child’s growth plates;
•    fit a wide range of pediatric anatomy;
•    enable earlier surgical intervention;
•    enable precise and reproducible surgical techniques; and
•    ease implant removal.
We believe our innovative products promote improved surgical accuracy, increase consistency of patient outcomes and enhance surgeon confidence in achieving high standards of care. In the future, we expect to expand our product offering to address additional categories of the pediatric orthopedic market, such as active growing implants for early onset scoliosis, limb length discrepancies and other orthopedic trauma and deformity applications.
Our global sales organization focuses exclusively on pediatric orthopedics. Our organization has a deep understanding of the unique nature of children’s clinical conditions and surgical procedures as well as an appreciation of the tremendous sense of responsibility pediatric orthopedic surgeons feel for the children whom parents have entrusted to their care. We provide these surgeons with dedicated support, both in and out of the operating room. As of December 31, 2022, our U.S. sales organization consisted of 41 independent sales agencies employing more than 197 focused sales representatives. Increasingly, these sales agencies are making us the anchor line in their businesses or representing us exclusively. Sales from such sales agencies represented 68% and 76% of our global revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Outside of the United States, our sales organization consisted of more than 70 independent stocking distributors and 14 independent sales agencies in over 70 countries. 
We collaborate with pediatric orthopedic surgeons in developing new surgical systems that improve the quality of care. We have an efficient product development process that relies upon teams of engineers, commercial personnel and surgeon advisors. We believe our products are characterized by stable pricing, few reimbursement issues and attractive gross margins.
We believe clinical education is critical to advancing the field of pediatric orthopedics. Cumulatively, we are the largest financial contributor to the five primary pediatric orthopedic surgical societies that conduct pediatric clinical education and research. We are a major sponsor of continuing medical education, or CME, courses in pediatric spine and pediatric orthopedics, which are focused on fellows and young surgeons. In 2022, we conducted numerous training workshops. We believe these workshops help surgeons recognize our commitment to their field. We believe our commitment to clinical education has helped to increase our account presence while promoting familiarity with our products and loyalty among fellows and young surgeons.
We have established a corporate culture built on the cause of improving the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. We believe our higher corporate purpose captures the imagination of our employees and makes them committed to doing everything better, faster and at lower cost. This culture allows us to attract and retain talented, high-performing individuals.
We have grown our revenue from approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The compound annual growth rate for the Company from 2011 through 2022 is 25.3%. This growth was partially obtained through strategic acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our revenue was $122.3 million, $98.0 million and $71.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit was $176.8 million.
We believe we have a history of efficient capital utilization, and we intend to scale our business model by continuing to implement the successful strategy that has sustained our growth. This strategy includes increasing investment in consigned implant and instrument sets in the United States and select international markets, expanding our innovative product line by leveraging our efficient product development process, strengthening our global sales and distribution infrastructure, broadening our commitment to clinical education and research, and deepening our culture of continuous improvement. Due to the high concentration of pediatric orthopedic surgeons in comparatively few hospitals, we believe we can accelerate the penetration of our addressable market in a capital-efficient manner and further strengthen our position as the category leader in pediatric orthopedics. The primary challenges to maintaining our growth in a market that has not historically relied on age-specific implants and instruments have been insufficient implant/instrument sets and overcoming older surgeons’ familiarity with repurposing adult implants for use in children. Our efforts in surgeon training, collaboration and marketing address the inertia of using repurposed adult products, particularly with younger surgeons.
Industry Overview
Children Have Unique Skeletal Characteristics
Their skeletal anatomy and physiology differs significantly from adults, which affects the way in which children with orthopedic conditions are managed surgically. These differences include:
•    Children’s Bones Are Smaller. Children’s bones are significantly smaller than adult bones. Bone size and strength increases rapidly during childhood and adolescence.
•    Children's Bones Are Growing. Children’s bones contain growth plates, or physes, that consist of developing cartilage tissue at the end of the bone, enabling skeletal growth. Bones grow lengthwise from the ends of the growth plates until skeletal maturity is reached and the growth plates close. As this occurs, some bones fuse together, reducing the 270 bones children have at birth to 206 bones by adulthood. Injury to the growth plates, including fracture or surgical trauma, can lead to growth arrest and subsequent deformity.
•    The Composition and Vasculature of Children’s Bones Is Unique. Children’s bones are more porous and respond to injury and infection differently than adult bones. Children also have blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to bones as they grow, which disappear when the growth plates close and the child reaches adulthood. Trauma to these blood vessels during surgery may cut off blood supply to the bone, resulting in death of the bone tissue.
•    Children’s Bones Change Shape as They Grow. Children’s bones are more curved than adult bones. As children grow into adulthood, their bones change shape. For example, the curvature of the femur decreases up to 30% as a child matures.
•    Complex Disorders in Children Pose Unique Clinical Challenges. Complex disorders such as cerebral palsy, scoliosis, brittle bone disease and hip disorders can pose significant challenges for surgical treatment. The most common such disorder is cerebral palsy, which affects approximately 500,000 children under the age of 18 in the United States and approximately three out of every 1,000 live births. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form, making up the majority of all cerebral palsy cases. Spastic cerebral palsy can produce skeletal deformities such as curvature of the spine, hip dislocation, gait abnormalities and other conditions involving joints and bones. Children suffering from these disorders often require multiple surgeries into adulthood.
We believe the challenges resulting from the unique characteristics of children’s skeletal anatomy and physiology, as well as the complex disorders affecting them, are best addressed by the use of implants and instruments specifically designed for the treatment of children.
Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeons Are Generalists
Unlike orthopedic surgeons focused on treating adults, pediatric orthopedic surgeons are, for the most part, generalists treating a wide range of congenital, developmental and traumatic orthopedic conditions, including limb and spine deformities, gait abnormalities, bone and joint infections, sports injuries and orthopedic trauma cases. Accordingly, they generally represent a single call point for our broad range of pediatric orthopedic implants and instruments. In 2022, there were more than 1,400 members of Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA), as compared to approximately 33,400 practicing orthopedic surgeons in the United States focused on the treatment of adults. The number of fellowships in pediatric orthopedics continues to grow. As generalists, these surgeons have a deep understanding of the unique nature of children’s clinical conditions and surgical procedures. We believe they feel a tremendous sense of responsibility for the children whom parents have entrusted to their care.
Market Opportunity
We currently serve a portion of the pediatric orthopedic implant market that we estimate represents a $3.9 billion opportunity globally, including over $1.7 billion in the United States. The chart below provides the estimated sizes of the categories of our U.S. addressable market opportunity, based on third-party data (including data compiled by IMS Health, Inc. and Life Science Intelligence, Inc. in studies that we commissioned) regarding the number of procedures performed in 2015 and our average revenue per procedure or, in the case of smart implants, our estimated average revenue per procedure based on industry data. We then updated this data in 2022 based on management estimates and typical industry growth rates.
Trauma and Deformity | Scoliosis | Sports Medicine | Smart Implants
Surgical Implants | Specialty Bracing | Fusion | Non-Fusion | 
$609 Million | $303 Million | $334 Million | $75 Million | $249 Million | $162 Million

We estimate that the United States represented approximately 45% of the total global orthopedic implant market, both adult and pediatric, and that this geographic segmentation similarly applies to the global pediatric orthopedic implant market. 
Overviews of the three categories of the trauma and deformity, scoliosis and sports medicine markets that we currently serve, and the smart implant market that we are planning to enter, are as follows:
Trauma and Deformity Correction
Trauma and deformity correction surgical procedures involve placing metal plates and screws on the outside of the bone or long nails inside the canal of the bone, known as flexible and rigid intramedullary nails, to stabilize fractures and allow them to heal. Trauma and deformity procedures also include osteotomies, or surgical cutting of the bone, the use of metal implants to correct angular bone deformities or limb length discrepancies and external fixation. Trauma and deformity also includes specialized bracing products which are non-surgical in nature. 
Scoliosis
Scoliosis procedures involve the use of spinal implants, such as pedicle screws and rods, to correct curvature of the spine as a result of scoliosis, trauma or tumors.
Sports Medicine
Sports medicine procedures include reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, and medial patellofemoral ligament, or MPFL. These reconstruction procedures refer to the replacement of the ACL or MPFL ligaments, as applicable, with a surgical tissue graft to restore function to the knee after injury. According to Life Science Intelligence, Inc., in a study that we commissioned, approximately 29% of ACL reconstruction procedures completed in the United States in 2015 were in patients under the age of 18. The vast majority of these procedures were performed in ambulatory surgery centers.
Smart Implants
We are developing a new generation of adjustable implant systems, which we refer to as our Active Growing Implants, which will utilize a mechanized motor and are adjustable at the time of implantation and non-invasively over the course of treatment to accommodate the clinical needs of patients with early onset scoliosis and limb length discrepancies, or LLDs, as they heal, grow and age.
Early onset scoliosis refers to severe spinal deformities in skeletally immature patients under the age of ten. Despite its low incidence rate, early onset scoliosis is a challenging health issue and can lead to significant morbidity.
LLDs can occur for a variety of reasons, including congenital deformities and previous injury to the bone. Larger LLDs often result in debilitating pain and difficulty to walk.
High Procedural Concentration in Trauma and Deformity and Scoliosis
According to IMS Health, Inc., 3,425 hospitals performed pediatric trauma and deformity or scoliosis procedures in the United States in 2015. Approximately 300 of these hospitals performed over 62% of all pediatric trauma and deformity and scoliosis procedures. We believe that this high concentration of pediatric trauma and deformity and scoliosis procedures and our focused sales organization will enable us to address the pediatric orthopedic surgery market in a capital-efficient manner.
We estimate that these 300 U.S. pediatric centers represent a target market of $0.9 billion. The table below provides the estimated sizes of the categories of this target market, based on third-party data (including data compiled by IMS Health, Inc. and Life Science Intelligence, Inc. in studies that we commissioned) which was then updated in 2022 with management estimates based on typical industry growth rates.

 | Trauma and Deformity | Scoliosis | 
 | Surgical Implants | Specialty Bracing | Fusion | Non-Fusion | Sports Medicine
U.S. High-Volume Children's Hospitals Target Market | $378 Million | $197 Million | $207 Million | $68 Million | $82 Million 

In the future, we expect to expand our market opportunity by addressing additional categories of the pediatric orthopedic market, such as craniomaxilloacial, upper extremity, pediatric orthopedic oncology, pelvis, and other sports-related injuries.
Our Exclusive Focus on Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery
We believe we are the only company that has committed the resources necessary to create a global sales and product development infrastructure focused on the pediatric orthopedic implant market. Our goal is to build an enduring company committed to addressing this market’s unmet needs.

With the assistance of our Medical Director, a highly respected former pediatric orthopedic surgeon, we engage with pediatric orthopedic surgeons to understand their clinical needs and develop new implants, instruments and surgical techniques that will allow them to better serve their patients. We also respond to surgeons’ requests for customized implants and instruments to improve their workflows and enhance their clinical outcomes.
•    Leading Supporter of Pediatric Orthopedic Surgical Societies and Clinical Education. Cumulatively, we donate more than any of our competitors to the five primary pediatric orthopedic surgical societies that conduct pediatric clinical education and research. In 2022, we conducted numerous training workshops focused on fellows and surgeons early in their careers. We believe our commitment to clinical education advances pediatric orthopedic surgery and increases our account presence, while promoting familiarity with our products and loyalty among fellows and young surgeons. We aspire to be viewed as the partner of pediatric orthopedic surgeons around the world.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our focus and experience in pediatric orthopedic surgery, combined with the following principal competitive strengths, will allow us to continue to grow our sales and expand our market opportunity.
•    Exclusive Focus on Pediatric Orthopedics. We were founded with the mission of improving the lives of children with orthopedic conditions, a patient population which we believe has been largely neglected by the orthopedic industry. We believe we are the first diversified orthopedic company to focus exclusively on the pediatric market. Our core competencies are the development and commercialization of innovative products and technologies specifically designed to address the unmet clinical needs of pediatric orthopedic patients and satisfy the demands of the surgeons who treat them. We have developed and sell the broadest product offering specifically designed for pediatric orthopedic patients. We believe we are the only orthopedic company to have established a robust pediatric-focused infrastructure, including product development and a dedicated global commercial organization. We believe our exclusive focus on pediatric orthopedics has generated strong brand equity in the pediatric orthopedic surgeon community.
•    Comprehensive Portfolio of Innovative Orthopedic Products Designed Specifically for Children. We have developed a comprehensive portfolio of implants and instruments specifically designed to treat children with orthopedic conditions. In 2022, we estimate that our products were used to help approximately 70,000 children, and over 630,000 since inception, when including those served by our acquired companies. We currently market 46 surgical and specialized bracing systems consisting of more than 11,200 stock keeping units, which address pediatric trauma and deformity, scoliosis and sports medicine procedures. Our products include features that provide specific advantages for pediatric orthopedic surgeons and their patients, such as surgical instrumentation specifically designed for use in children, proper anatomical sizes and contouring, and proprietary designs that address the unique skeletal anatomy and physiology of a growing child. Our broad product offering has made us, within the three categories of the market that we currently serve, the only provider of comprehensive solutions to pediatric orthopedic surgeons, who for the most part are generalists performing a wide range of orthopedic surgeries. 
•    Partnership with Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeons and Pediatric Surgical Societies. We have devoted significant time and resources to developing deep relationships with pediatric orthopedic surgeons and supporting clinical education to advance the practice of pediatric orthopedic medicine. This enables us to engage and collaborate with thought-leading surgeons and academic institutions around the world in order to develop products and technologies specifically designed to meet the needs of pediatric orthopedic surgeons and their patients. Our dedication to the pediatric orthopedic community is evidenced by our leading support of the five major pediatric orthopedic surgical societies that conduct pediatric clinical education and research. In 2022, we conducted numerous training workshops focused on fellows and surgeons early in their careers. We are a major sponsor of CME courses in pediatric spine and pediatric orthopedics. We believe collaborating with pediatric orthopedic surgeons has helped to promote familiarity with our products and loyalty among fellows and surgeons early in their careers.
•    Scalable Business Model. Our ability to identify and respond quickly to the needs of pediatric orthopedic surgeons and their patients is central to our culture and critical to our continued success. As of December 31, 2022, our U.S. sales organization consisted of 41 independent sales agencies employing more than 197 sales representatives. Outside of the United States, we work with 70 independent stocking distributors and 14 independent sales agencies in 70 countries. We estimate that over 62% of U.S. pediatric trauma and deformity and scoliosis 
procedures in 2015 were performed in approximately 300 hospitals. We believe that this high concentration of procedures and our focused sales organization will enable us to address the pediatric orthopedic surgery market in a capital-efficient manner. In addition, we believe our exclusive focus on hospitals that perform pediatric orthopedic surgery will allow us to grow our revenue while leveraging investment in a smaller number of consigned implant and instrument sets.

•    Unique Culture: A Different Kind of Orthopedic Company. We have established a results-oriented, people-focused corporate culture dedicated to improving the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. Our senior management team provides engaging leadership and believes that the only hierarchy is that of good ideas, which can come from everywhere in our company. Our Trauma and Deformity and Scoliosis businesses are each led by a President, who chairs a business team composed of representatives from the research and development, quality and regulatory, operations, sales, human resources and finance functions. These teams meet frequently and make decisions regarding new products, inventory builds and promotional activities, thus enhancing our agility and the speed of decision making. We believe this culture allows us to attract and retain talented, high performing professionals. For seven years we have been named one of the Best Companies to work for in Indiana. We believe our focus and commitment to pediatric orthopedics has also enhanced our reputation among pediatric orthopedic surgeons as the only diversified orthopedic company focused on their specialty.
We believe that our exclusive focus on pediatric orthopedic surgery, our comprehensive product portfolio, our collaborations with surgeons, our scalable business model and our engaging culture are all sources of significant competitive advantage. We believe these sources of competitive advantage provide us with the means to expand and defend our position as category leader and constitute barriers to entry that would require significant time, focus, and investment for a competitor to overcome.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to continue to enhance our leadership in the pediatric orthopedic surgery market and thereby improve the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. To achieve this goal, we have implemented a strategy that has five pillars:
•    Continue our laser focus on high-volume children’s hospitals that treat the majority of pediatric patients. According to IMS Health, Inc., 3,425 hospitals performed pediatric trauma and deformity or scoliosis procedures in the United States in 2015. Approximately 300 of these hospitals performed over 62% of all pediatric trauma and deformity and scoliosis procedures. This high concentration of procedures and our focused sales organization will enable us to address the pediatric orthopedic surgery market in a capital-efficient manner. 
•    Provide a broad product portfolio uniquely designed to treat children by surrounding pediatric orthopedic surgeons with all the products they need. We intend to leverage our market knowledge and our relationships with leading pediatric orthopedic surgeons to continue developing innovative technologies and bringing them to market quickly. When appropriate, we will also partner with complimentary, enabling technology which will allow for greater coverage of orthopedic surgeon needs. We believe broadening our product offering will strengthen our position as the comprehensive solution provider for pediatric orthopedic surgeons, deepen our relationships with existing customers, lead to the conversion of new customers and enhance our reputation.
•    Deploy instrument sets and provide unparalleled sales support. We intend to increase our investment in implant and instrument sets consigned to hospitals in the United States and select international markets to satisfy market demand and accelerate our product sales worldwide. Due to the high concentration of pediatric orthopedic surgeons in comparatively few hospitals, we believe we can accelerate the penetration of our addressable market efficiently while supporting our customers with the only global sales and distribution channel focused exclusively on pediatric orthopedics. 
•    Expand addressable market through aggressive investment in research and development, and select acquisition opportunities. We have a track record of introducing innovative products that meet the clinical needs of pediatric orthopedic surgeons and their patients. We believe many of these products are becoming the standard of care in pediatric orthopedic surgery, and we intend to increase our investment in research and development of new products. We aspire to launch at least one new surgical system and multiple product line extensions in our trauma and deformity and scoliosis businesses each year for the foreseeable future. We will also continue to seek partnership and select acquisition opportunities that expand our total available market and serve new unmet needs in pediatric orthopedics.
•    Train the next generation of pediatric orthopedic surgeons. We want pediatric orthopedic surgeons to view us as their partner in advancing the entire field of pediatric orthopedic surgery. Beyond working with them to develop innovative products, we intend to deepen our partnership with surgeons by leveraging the experience of our senior management team, including our Medical Director, to expand our clinical education programs and partnerships with teaching hospitals, sponsor surgical workshops for residents and fellows and support worthwhile clinical research projects. We believe our commitment to clinical education and research enables us to advance the practice of pediatric orthopedic surgery and provides surgeons with access to sophisticated training in pediatric orthopedics that is not available through traditional residents’ training programs. We believe these efforts will continue to promote familiarity with our products and loyalty among fellows and young surgeons and generate new product ideas that will contribute to growth, enhance our competitive position, and expand our market opportunity.
Our Product Portfolio
We have developed a comprehensive portfolio of implants and instruments specifically designed to treat children with orthopedic conditions within the three categories of the pediatric orthopedic market that we currently serve. We currently market 46 surgical and specialized bracing systems that address pediatric trauma and deformity correction, scoliosis and sports medicine/other procedures. Many of our products are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to address a wide range of patient conditions and surgical requirements. These surgical systems are summarized below.
Trauma and Deformity Correction
Our trauma and deformity correction product line includes more than 7,900 implants, external fixation, specialized braces and bone graft substitutes for the femur, tibia, upper and lower extremities. Our global revenue from this category for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $85.1 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, and represented 70% of total revenue. Global revenue from this category for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $65.8 million and $47.7 million or 67% and 67% of total revenue, respectively. 
Scoliosis
Our scoliosis product category includes our RESPONSETM systems for treating spinal deformity in children, the BandLocTM 5.5mm/6.0mm sub-laminar banding system, FIREFLY® Pedicle Screw Navigation Guides, 7D FlashTM Naviation image guidance system and ApiFix® Mid-C System. Our global revenue from this category for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $33.4 million, or 27% of total revenue, which represented an increase of 19% over the prior year. Global revenue from this category for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $28.0 million and $20.7 million or 29% and 29% of total revenue, respectively.
In addition to our direct product offering, we also invest in complementary enabling technologies that allow us to better serve the children's hospitals in which we sell. Enabling technologies in our scoliosis space include the FIREFLY® Technology, a 3D printed and patient-specific Pedicle Screw Navigation Guide as well as the 7D FLASHTM Navigation image guidance system. We have exclusive distribution rights to both of these complementary technologies, allowing for exclusive distribution in children's hospitals across the United States. 
Sports Medicine/Other
Our sports medicine/other product category primarily includes our ACL, MPFL Reconstruction system and Telos. Our global revenue from this category for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3.8 million, or 3% of total revenue, which represented a decline of 9% over the prior year. Global revenue from this category for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4.2 million and $2.7 million or 4% and 4% of total revenue, respectively. 
Our revenue is typically higher in the summer months and holiday periods, driven by higher sales of our trauma and deformity and scoliosis products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of pediatric surgeries during these periods due to recovery time provided by breaks in the school year. 
Product Pipeline
Generally speaking, we have three product development objectives across the organization: (i) develop innovative new systems that enable surgeons to advance the field of pediatric orthopedics and allow us to focus on categories of the pediatric orthopedic market we are not currently addressing; (ii) build-out our current portfolio of products with line extensions that allow these systems to be used in more types of surgeries; and (iii) make improvements to our current implants and instruments that improve quality and reduce their cost. We have a large number of new product ideas under development within the areas of spinal implants, active growing smart implants, trauma implant systems, limb deformity implant systems, and non-surgical devices. We aspire to launch at least one new system and/or line extension/product improvement every quarter across the Company.
We have a deep pipeline of new systems that are currently under development, including the following projects.
Pediatric Nailing Platform | Tibia
In the first half of 2023, we plan to submit a 510(k) for an innovative Pediatric Nailing Platform | Tibia, that will use a similar instrument platform to the Pediatric Nailing Platform | Femur system, which was introduced in 2018. This new to the market system will treat deformities and traumatic injuries of the tibia. We expect the beta launch to occur in 2023 and a full-scale launch to occur in 2024. 
Active Growing Implants
We are developing a new generation of smart implants, which we refer to as our Active Growing Implants. Our Active Growing Implants will utilize a power source of significantly greater strength and control than current magnetic technology and will be adjustable at the time of implantation and non-invasively over the course of treatment to accommodate the changing clinical needs of patients as they heal, grow and age. We made significant development progress on this in 2022. This new technology will be available for early onset scoliosis and potentially limb deformity. 
RESPONSETM Rib and Pelvic System
Our RESPONSETM Rib and Pelvic System is designed to aid surgeons in the treatment of early onset scoliosis, a debilitating form of scoliosis that affects very young children. We expect to beta launch the system in 2023. 
Growth Guidance for Scoliosis
We are developing a next-generation growth guidance technology for treating certain forms of early onset scoliosis. This procedure uses rods and pedicle screws attached to specific points in the spine and configured similar to a “track and trolley” system which allows the spine to grow naturally while correcting a spinal curve. 
Development of Operative Planning Software
We have a number of initiatives underway involving the development of both pre-operative planning and intraoperative use software to assist surgeons in the treatment of spinal, trauma and deformity correction conditions as well as the utilization of the Company’s product solutions for these conditions. These projects encompass both educational and software as a medical device type offering.
External Fixation Systems
We plan to continue development to support the strengthening of our external fixation product portfolio. Throughout 2022, we launched the Drive Rail system that complements the Mini Rail and Orthex product offering. In addition to a suite of innovative features, this system is compatible for use with the Orthex frame. Further development will focus on hardware and software upgrades as well as a completely new system for emergency fracture management. 
Research and Product Development
We seek to leverage our considerable experience in pediatric orthopedics to develop innovative implants and instruments that serve the unmet needs of pediatric orthopedic surgeons and their patients. Some of our product designs leverage our exclusive rights to the Hamann-Todd Collection of the Cleveland Natural History Museum, the world’s largest pediatric osteological collection.
We have made significant investments in product development personnel and infrastructure, and we believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success. Our culture of continuous improvement challenges us to develop better products efficiently and at lower cost. New products are developed by teams of engineers, commercial personnel and surgeon advisors, who work closely together through the design, prototype and market-testing phases of a product’s development.
Sales and Marketing
We believe we are the only orthopedic company with a robust pediatric-focused infrastructure, including a dedicated global commercial organization. As of December 31, 2022, our U.S. sales organization consisted of 41 independent sales agencies employing 197 focused sales representatives. Increasingly, these sales agencies are making us the anchor line in their businesses or representing us exclusively. Sales to customers from such agencies represented 68% of our global revenue in 2022 and 76% in 2021.
Outside of the United States, our sales organization consisted of over 70 independent stocking distributors and 14 independent sales agencies in over 70 countries, including the largest markets in the European Union, Latin America and the Middle East, as well as South Africa, Australia and Japan. We believe our distributors are well regarded by pediatric orthopedic surgeons in their respective markets. To support our international distribution organization, we have hired a number of regional market managers, whose product and clinical expertise deepens our relationships with both surgeons and our distributors. In the near term, we expect to selectively expand the number of international markets we serve, as well as to deepen our penetration of important existing markets such as Brazil and Germany. 
We have developed intensive training programs for our global sales organization. We expect our sales agencies and distributors to continue to deepen their knowledge of pediatric clinical conditions, surgical procedures and our products, thus increasing their effectiveness. Our domestic and international sales representatives are usually present in the operating room during surgeries in which our products are used. We believe the clinical expertise of our global sales organization and their presence both in and out of the operating room will enable them to increase pediatric orthopedic surgeons’ confidence in using our products, deepen their relationships with existing customers and lead to the acquisition of new customers.
Global Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon Involvement, Education and Training
We are dedicated to the cause of improving the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. We want pediatric orthopedic surgeons throughout the world to view us as their partner in advancing their field. Therefore, we utilize surgeon input when developing products and clinical education programs. These efforts are aided by our Medical Director, a highly respected former pediatric orthopedic surgeon. Our entire organization, including our senior executive team and sales representatives, maintains an extensive network of contacts with pediatric orthopedic surgeons. These relationships help us understand clinical needs, respond quickly to customer ideas and support new developments in the field of pediatric orthopedics.
We are committed to advancing pediatric orthopedic care by supporting clinical education. We support local, regional and national educational courses, intensive hands-on training programs and product-based workshops that enable surgeons to practice surgical procedures using our products. In 2022, we conducted numerous training workshops focused on fellows and surgeons early in their careers. We are also a major sponsor of CME courses in pediatric spine and pediatric orthopedics. Annually, we sponsor the largest industry meetings including 
the Annual International Children's Spine Symposium, Annual Pediatric Orthopedic Surgical Techniques Course, Akron Pediatric Orthopedic Residents Review Course and the annual PediOrthoWest resident review program. We have a growing commitment to the clinical research performed by surgeons. This commitment ranges from providing our products for clinical outcome studies to providing advanced research grants.
Cumulatively, we are one of the largest financial contributors to pediatric orthopedic surgical societies that conduct pediatric clinical education and research: the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, the International Pediatric Orthopaedic Symposium, the European Pediatric Orthopaedic Society and the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine. Additionally, we are a sponsor of the two major spine deformity organizations, the Scoliosis Research Society and the International Meeting on Advanced Spine Techniques. We are also the founding and leading sponsor of the Pediatric Research in Sports Medicine Society and have significantly increased our sponsorship of the Baltimore Limb Deformity Course. In addition to these organizations, we also support eight pediatric orthopedic fellowships. Our support of these organizations and fellowships demonstrates our commitment to the clinical training and research they sponsor. We believe this support enhances our reputation as the category leader in pediatric orthopedics.
Additionally, during 2020, 2021 and 2022, we funded The Foundation for Advancing Pediatric Orthopaedics ("Foundation") as a 501(c)3 public charity. The Foundation channels OrthoPediatrics' clinical education funding together with contributions from the general public to support non-commercial education programs and clinical research. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our products are primarily manufactured to our specifications by third-party suppliers who meet our manufacturer qualification standards. MD Ortho's specialized bracing products are manufactured on-site in our Iowa facility. Our third-party manufacturers meet FDA and other country-specific quality standards, supported by our internal specifications and procedures. We believe these manufacturing relationships allow us to work with suppliers who have well-developed specialized competencies, minimize our capital investment, control costs and shorten cycle times, all of which we believe allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of orthopedic implants. We work closely with our suppliers with a goal of ensuring our inventory needs are met while maintaining high quality and reliability.
All of our device contract manufacturers are required to be ISO 13485 certified and are registered establishments with the FDA. Our internal quality management group conducts comprehensive on-site inspection audits of our suppliers to ensure they meet FDA and other country-specific requirements, as necessary. In addition, we and our suppliers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by U.S. and international regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with quality regulations.
We maintain certain long-term contracts with our key suppliers. The majority of our suppliers do not require guaranteed minimum purchases. In most cases, we have redundant manufacturing capabilities for each of our products. To date, we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining the materials necessary to meet demand for our products, and we believe manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our products for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary confidentiality and other contractual protections. We own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our technology. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 61 issued U.S. patents and 115 issued foreign patents and we had 33 pending U.S. patent applications and 166 foreign patent applications. As of December 31, 2022, 11 of our U.S. issued patents have pending continuation or divisional applications in process which may provide additional intellectual property protection if issued as U.S. patents. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2024 and 2039, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 31 U.S. trademark registrations and 7 pending U.S. trademark applications, as well as 77 registrations in other jurisdictions worldwide.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Competition
The orthopedic industry is competitive, subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants. Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to competition. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•    improved outcomes for medical conditions;
•    acceptance by orthopedic surgeons;
•    ease of use and reliability;
•    acceptance by the patient community;
•    product price;
•    availability of implant-specific instrument sets;
•    effective marketing and distribution; and
•    speed to market.
We have competitors in each of our three product categories, including the DePuy Synthes Companies (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Medtronic plc, Smith & Nephew plc and Orthofix. We believe we have the broadest pediatric product offering across these categories relative to these competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, are cost effective and are safe and effective. They also require a dedicated selling organization that is viewed by pediatric orthopedic surgeons as a consultative resource that can attend surgery. 
Human Capital and Community Support
We believe that maintaining a sufficient number of skilled employees in all departments of our Company is a key focus of our human capital. We employ a number of strategies to best enable us to attract, retain, and engage our employees. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 203 full-time employees, 27 of whom were engaged in research and development and 64 of whom were engaged in sales and marketing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
We strive to provide an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace, filled with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop. We believe that culture can be a company’s most powerful source of competitive advantage. Cultures are unique, cannot be reverse-engineered and are impossible to duplicate. We have established a corporate culture that is results-oriented and people-focused. It is built on the cause of improving the lives of children with orthopedic conditions. 
We believe our culture is bolstered not only by our compensation and benefits plans, but also by programs that support our local communities. This is demonstrated by both the Company's and its associates' regular participation in philanthropic causes. We recognize that building connections between our employees, their families, and the communities we serve creates a fulfilling and positive workplace. 
We also partner with organizations around the world that provide pediatric orthopedic care for the disadvantaged. Specifically, we have partnered with the World Pediatric Project, to whom we provide surgical products and treatment for children in developing countries, some of whom are flown to the United States for 
surgery. In 2020, we were named as "Corporate Partner of the Year" by the World Pediatric Project and we continued our support of this cause in 2021 and 2022. 
We encourage you to review our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") page under the "About" section of our corporate website for more detailed information regarding our ESG efforts and current initiatives, including a link to our Diversity & Inclusion Policy. Nothing on our website, including our Diversity & Inclusion Policy, shall be deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Government Regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States
Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a premarket notification ("510(k)") or premarket approval ("PMA"). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA.
These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Our currently marketed products are Class I and exempted from premarket notification, or Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance with the exception of the ApiFix Mid-C System which is an unclassified, approved device under the Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") regulation. 
Approval under the HDE regulation is contingent upon the submission of periodic reports at intervals of one year (unless otherwise specified) from the date of approval of the original HDE (August 2019). The purpose of the HDE provision is to encourage the discovery and use of devices intended to benefit patients in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases or conditions that affect not more than 8,000 individuals in the United States per year. The FDA may grant an HDE, which is an exemption from the effectiveness requirements of sections 514 and 515 of the FDCA Act, if the FDA determines that the device meets certain criteria. After HDE approval, the medical 
device may only be used after Institutional Review Board ("IRB") approval has been obtained. Under FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. The purpose of IRB review is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights, safety and welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. 
510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
Our Class II products are subject to 510(k) clearance under the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a 510k submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device). The FDA’s 510(k) review process usually takes from three to six months. The FDA may require additional information following their review. 
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device presented in the 510(k) submission, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to the predicate device, we may be required to fulfill more rigorous requirements, including those associated with the PMA process, to gain approval to commercialize.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) submission. Minor modifications may be accomplished by a manufacturer documenting the change in an internal letter-to-file. The FDA can always review these letters to file during an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination on major versus minor modifications, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until additional actions are completed. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Post-Market Regulation
Numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements apply to commercialized devices. These include:
•    establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•    QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•    labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
•    the federal Open Payments ("Sunshine") program and various state and foreign laws on reporting remunerative relationships with healthcare providers (HCPs);
•    the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid;
•    the federal False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that claim includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statute;
•    clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•    medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•    correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•    complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID);
•    the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•    post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods, facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
Enforcement Powers
The FDA has broad regulatory enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•    warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•    recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
•    operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•    refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•    withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•    refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
•    criminal prosecution.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA
All medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive ("MDD"). There is also a directive specifically addressing Active Implantable Medical Devices (Directive 90/385/EEC). The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as benchmarks to satisfy the essential requirements. 
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the MDD, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are separate entities from government that are authorized by government authorities to perform conformity assessments. The notified body also audits and examines a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the assessed devices conform to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.
In order to demonstrate safety and performance for their medical devices, manufacturers must evaluate applicable clinical data in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the MDD and applicable European and International Organization for Standardization standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical data may be in the form of relevant scientific literature of an equivalent device, clinical investigations of the device, or both. Clinical investigations for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
The Medical Devices Regulation ("MDR") entered into force in May 2017 and, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was postponed from its original application date of May 2020 to May 2021. The application date refers to the time by which the MDR goes into effect. On January 6, 2023, the European Commission sent a proposal to the European Parliament for extending the application date to December 31, 2027 for the Class III and IIb implantable devices. The proposal also seeks to extend the application date to December 31, 2028 for select Class IIb, Class IIa and Class I devices. On February 16, 2023, the European Parliament approved, in part, the extension of the application date for Class III and IIb implantable devices to December 31, 2027. The MDR imposes significant additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of all medical devices, imposes an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a “qualified person” responsible for regulatory compliance, and provides for more strict clinical evidence requirements. 
The MDR includes further controls and requirements on the following activities:
•    high level of request for premarket clinical evidence for high risk devices;
•    increased scrutiny of technical files for implantable devices;
•    monitoring of notified bodies, by independent auditors;
•    increased requirements regarding vigilance and product traceability (specifically related to labeling requirements);
•    increased regulation for non-traditional roles such as importer and distributor; and
•    Post-Market Clinical Follow-up that requires significantly greater clinical data specific to 
our devices, which leads to greater costs for collecting such data than under the MDD.
Regulations in the United Kingdom
Effective January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or the UK, withdrew from the European Union, or EU. New regulations specific to the UK went into effect beginning January 1, 2021 with a transitional period through June 30, 2024. These regulations may impact our ability to sell our products in the UK. During the transition period, devices with CE Markings may continue to be sold within the UK. Devices sold in Northern Ireland will be required to keep the CE Marking after the transition period ends. 
In order to comply with the new regulations and continue selling medical devices in the UK following the transition period, the Company must appoint a UK Responsible Person and register the medical devices with the UK's Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency, or MHRA. A new conformity assessment must be completed by a UK Approved Body, or UKAB. The UKAB will audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the UKAB issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the UKCA Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the UK. Once the product has been placed on the market in the UK, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.
Regulation of Medical Devices in Other Foreign Countries
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
•    design, development, manufacturing and testing;
•    product standards;
•    product safety;
•    product safety reporting;
•    marketing, sales and distribution;
•    packaging and storage requirements;
•    labeling requirements;
•    content and language of instructions for use;
•    clinical trials;
•    record keeping procedures;
•    advertising and promotion;
•    recalls and field corrective actions;
•    post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
•    import and export restrictions;
•    tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements;
•    registration for reimbursement; and
•    necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
Healthcare Regulations
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the DHHS issued regulations in July 1991, which the Department has referred to as “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, HCPs and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (described below).
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in imprisonment, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties, including criminal fines. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act, including penalties of up to three times the amounts paid for such claims. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act.
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA, was enacted, which modifies and clarifies certain provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act. In part, the FERA amends the federal civil False Claims Act such that penalties may now apply to any person, including an organization that does not contract directly with the government, who knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid in part by the federal government. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Also, many U.S. states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Open Payment ("Sunshine") program imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We may also become subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, in the United States.
Under HIPAA, the DHHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers and their business associates. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA violations carry civil and criminal penalties, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state.
In the European Union, we may be subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations. We process data of both our employees and our customers, including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws implementing each of them. Each EU Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the Data Protection Directive and E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ significantly by jurisdiction. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
The requirements include that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on a legal grounds set out in the local laws, and may only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant, not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected, be secure, not be transferred outside of the EEA unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes of collection. To the extent that we process, control or otherwise use sensitive data relating to living individuals (for example, patients’ health or medical information), more stringent rules apply, limiting the circumstances and the manner in which we are legally permitted to process that data and transfer that data outside of the EEA. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing (including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (being the person to whom the personal data relates).
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law.
Local laws are amended from time to time, and guidance is issued frequently by regulators. Any changes in law and new guidance may impact, and require changes to, our current operations. Additionally, on January 25, 2012, the European Commission published its draft EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). On March 12, 2014, the European Parliament formally passed a revised proposal of the Regulation, and the Council of the European Union published its general approach on June 15, 2015. Trilogue discussion between the European Commission, European Parliament and Council of the European Union have concluded and the GDPR came into force May 25, 2018. The Regulation implements significant changes to the EU data protection regime. Unlike the E-Privacy and Data Protection Directives, the Regulation has direct effect in each EU Member State, without the need for further enactment. The Regulation strengthened individuals’ rights and imposed stricter requirements on companies processing personal data, and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. 
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices (which was permanently repealed December 20, 2019), provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and 
other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing or delaying penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and is designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, extended the suspension period to March 31, 2021. In April 2021 it was suspended again through December 31, 2021. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments beginning January 1, 2020 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations.
We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our U.S. operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or FCPA. We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, our currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in orthopedic surgery and if covered by third-party payors, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Outside of the United States, there are many reimbursement programs through private payors as well as government programs. In some countries, government reimbursement is the predominant program available to patients and hospitals. Our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies.
Based on our experience to date, third-party payors generally reimburse for the surgical procedures in which our products are used only if the patient meets the established medical necessity criteria for surgery. Some payors 
are moving toward a managed care system and control their healthcare costs by limiting authorizations for surgical procedures, including elective procedures using our devices. Although no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States exists and coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor, reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors may depend upon a number of factors, including the payor’s determination that use of a product is:
•    a covered benefit under its health plan;
•    appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication;
•    cost effective; and
•    neither experimental nor investigational.
Third-party payors are increasingly auditing and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services with concern for upcoding, miscoding, using inappropriate modifiers, or billing for inappropriate care settings. Some third-party payors must approve coverage for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution by the FDA, we may find limited demand for the product unless and until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") is responsible for administering the Medicare program and sets coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program in the United States. The CMS, in partnership with state governments, also administers the Medicaid program and CHIP. CMS policies may alter coverage and payment related to our product portfolio in the future. These changes may occur as the result of national coverage determinations issued by CMS or as the result of local coverage determinations by contractors under contract with CMS to review and make coverage and payment decisions. Medicaid programs are funded by both federal and state governments, and may vary from state to state and from year to year and will likely play an even larger role in healthcare funding pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.
A key component in ensuring whether the appropriate payment amount is received for physician and other services, including those procedures using our products, is the existence of a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code, to describe the procedure in which the product is used. To receive payment, healthcare practitioners must submit claims to insurers using these codes for payment for medical services. CPT codes are assigned, maintained and annually updated by the American Medical Association and its CPT Editorial Board. If the CPT codes that apply to the procedures performed using our products are changed or deleted, reimbursement for performances of these procedures may be adversely affected.
In the United States, some insured individuals enroll in managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita (patient) basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products.
We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services. All third-party reimbursement programs are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring second opinions prior to major surgery, careful review of bills, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and other preventative services and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures. There can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be covered for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. More and more, local, product specific reimbursement law is applied as an overlay to medical device regulation, which has provided an additional layer of clearance requirement. Specifically, Australia now requires clinical 
data for clearance and reimbursement be in the form of prospective, multi-center studies, a high bar not previously applied. In addition, in France, certain innovative devices have been identified as needing to provide clinical evidence to support a “mark-specific” reimbursement.
It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.
In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our products.
