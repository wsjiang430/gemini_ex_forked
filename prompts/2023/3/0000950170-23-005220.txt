 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 Introduction
 Cryo-Cell International, Inc. (the “Company” or “Cryo-Cell”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1989. The Company is organized in three reportable segments; 1.) cellular processing and cryogenic storage for family use, with a current focus on the collection and preservation of umbilical cord blood and tissue stem cells, 2.) the manufacture of PrepaCyte® CB Processing System (“PrepaCyte CB”) units, the processing technology used to process umbilical cord blood stem cells, and 3.) cellular processing and cryogenic storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells for public use. The Company, in combination with its global affiliates, currently stores nearly 500,000 cord blood and cord tissue specimens worldwide for the exclusive benefit of newborn babies and possibly other members of their families. Founded in 1989, the Company was the world’s first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells in 1992. The Company's U.S.-based business operations, including the processing and storage of specimens, are handled from its headquarters facility in Oldsmar, Florida. The specimens are stored in commercially available cryogenic storage units at this technologically and operationally advanced facility.
In recent years, utilizing its infrastructure, experience and resources derived from its umbilical cord blood stem cell business, the Company has expanded its research and development activities to develop technologies related to stem cells harvested from sources beyond umbilical cord blood stem cells. During fiscal 2011, the Company introduced the advanced new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. The Company offers the cord tissue service in combination with the umbilical cord blood service. This service is growing; however, the umbilical cord blood service continues to be the Company’s main focus.
 Cord Blood Stem Cell Processing and Storage Business
Background of Business
 Nearly fifty years ago researchers discovered that cells could be cryopreserved at extremely low temperatures and all cellular activity would cease until the specimens were thawed. Historically, cryopreservation was required for organ transplants, blood banking and medical research. Today, cryopreservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells gives individuals the opportunity to potentially take advantage of evolving cellular therapies and other medical technologies.
Hematopoietic stem cells are the building blocks of our blood and immune systems. They form the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body and platelets that promote healing. Stem cells are found in bone marrow where they continue to generate cells throughout our lives. Stem cells can be stored in a cryogenic environment, and upon thawing, infused into a patient. They can be returned to the
individual from whom they were taken (autologous) or donated to someone else (allogeneic). An individual's own bone marrow may be used for a transplant if the cancer has not entered the marrow system (metastasized). Otherwise, a marrow donor needs to be identified to provide the needed bone marrow. The availability of a marrow donor or matched stem cell specimen allows physicians to administer larger doses of chemotherapy or radiation in an effort to eradicate the disease. Stem cell therapies and transplants are used for both cancerous and non-cancerous diseases.
Stem cells are found in umbilical cord blood ("cord blood stem cells") and can be collected and stored after a baby is born. Over 50,000 cord blood stem cell transplants have been performed to date. The Company believes that parents will want to save and store these cells for potential future use by their family, either for the donor or for another family member. Moreover, researchers believe they may be utilized in the future for treating diseases that currently have no cure.
 The Company believes that the market for cord blood stem cell preservation is enhanced by global discussion on stem cell research developments and the current focus on reducing prohibitive health care costs. With the increasing costs of bone marrow matches and transplants, a newborn's umbilical cord blood cells can be stored as a precautionary measure. Medical technology is constantly evolving which may provide new uses for cryopreserved cord blood stem cells.
 Our Cord Blood Stem Cell Storage Services
 The Company enters into storage agreements with its clients under which the Company charges a fee for the processing and testing and first year of storage of the umbilical cord blood. Thereafter, the client is charged an annual fee to store the specimen, unless the client has entered into an 18-year pre-paid storage plan or a lifetime pre-paid storage plan.
 The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in a nearly 18,000 square-foot state-of-the-art current Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Tissue Practice (cGMP/cGTP)-compliant facility. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) 21 CFR Part 1271, effective in May 2005, requires human cellular and tissue-based products to be manufactured in compliance with good tissue practices (cGTPs). The Company’s laboratory processing facility contains a Class 10,000 clean room and Class 100 environments for the processing of cord blood stem cells and other cellular tissues. In addition, the cellular products cryogenic storage area has been designed as a “bunker,” with enhanced provisions for security, building fortification for environmental element protection and back-up systems for operational redundancies. The Company believes that it was the first private bank to process cord blood in a technologically and operationally advanced cGMP/cGTP-compliant facility. The Company’s facility, which also currently houses the Company’s client services, marketing and administrative operations, is designed to accommodate a broad range of events such as client tours and open houses, as well as educational workshops for clinicians and expectant parents.
Competitive Advantages
 The Company believes that it provides several key advantages over its competitors, including:
 •The world’s first private cord blood bank, that in combination with its global affiliates, currently stores nearly 500,000 cord blood and cord tissue specimens worldwide,
 •our status as a cGMP- and cGTP-compliant private cord blood bank with AABB accreditation and FACT (the Foundation for the Accreditation for Cellular Therapy) accreditation,
 •a state-of-the-art laboratory processing facility,
 •utilization of a processing method using superior technology that yields the maximum recovery of healthy stem cells and provides superior red blood depletion over all other methods,
 •a five-compartment cord blood freezer bag that allows for multiple uses of the baby’s cord blood stem cells,
 •a safe, secure and monitored storage environment,
 •since inception, 100% viability rate of the Company’s specimens upon thaw for therapeutic use,
 •a state-of the-art, insulated collection kit that protects cord blood specimens thirty times longer under extreme conditions than competitor’s kits,

•7 day per week processing capability, and
 •a payment warranty under which the Company agrees to pay $50,000 (effective February 1, 2012 this payment was increased to $75,000 for new clients, effective June 1, 2017 this payment was increased to $100,000 for new clients that choose the premium cord blood processing method, PrepaCyte CB) to its client if the umbilical cord blood product retrieved is used for a stem cell transplant for the donor or an immediate family member and fails to engraft, subject to various restrictions.
 Cord Tissue
 In August 2011, the Company introduced its advanced new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. Approximately six inches of the cord tissue is procured and transported to the Company’s laboratory for processing, testing and cryopreservation for future potential use. Umbilical cord tissue is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, to secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and to differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage. MSCs are increasingly being researched in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions including heart and kidney disease, ALS, wound healing and auto-immune diseases. MSCs from several different tissues are being tested in clinical trials for efficacy. Specifically, cells derived from cord tissue are currently being used in many clinical trials. Disorders being treated include cardiomyopathy, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, anemia, autism and cirrhosis of the liver.
Public Banking
 In June 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets (the “Cord Purchase”) of Cord:Use Cord Blood Bank, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Cord:Use”), in accordance with the definitive Asset Purchase Agreement between Cryo-Cell and Cord:Use (the “Purchase Agreement”), including without limitation Cord:Use’s inventory of public cord blood units existing as of the closing date (the “Public Cord Blood Inventory”). The Public Cord Blood Inventory creates a large, ethnically diverse, high quality inventory of available cord blood stem cell units for those in need of life saving therapy. The Company collects cord blood units at hospitals in Florida, Arizona, California, Michigan and Washington. The Company’s public inventory is stored in North Carolina, and the cord blood units are sold through the National Marrow Donor Program (“NMDP”) located in Minnesota, who ultimately distributes the cord blood units to transplant centers located in the United States, and around the world.

ExtraVault
 On July 18, 2022, the Company completed the purchase of a 56,000 square foot facility located near the Research Triangle Park in the Regional Commerce Center in Durham, North Carolina (the “New Facility”). The New Facility has space for not only its existing and future internal storage needs, but also has the capacity to offer third party pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions cold storage services (“ExtraVault” – see www.extravault.com), to set up a cellular therapy laboratory to manufacture mesenchymal stromal cells from cord tissue (“MSCs”) and the space to consolidate the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies under the same roof.
 
The Company anticipates this New Facility will expand the Company’s cryopreservation and cold storage business by introducing a new service, ExtraVault (www.extravault.com). With over 30 years of experience in handling biological specimens for both research and clinical use, Cryo-Cell intends to leverage this expertise and offer these biorepository services to biopharmaceutical companies and healthcare institutions. The new facility is being constructed to offer state-of-the-art biologic, reagent and vaccine storage at cost effective prices. A robust inventory management system is planned to be implemented that Cryo-Cell believes will allow customers to view their own inventory through a customer portal and place distribution orders online. As a result, it is anticipated ExtraVault will provide expertise, experience, customer electronic access and cost sensitive solutions to the Company’s partners in the biopharma and healthcare industries.
 Marketing
Marketing Approach
 It is the Company’s mission to inform expectant parents and their prenatal care providers of the potential medical benefits from preserving stem cells and to provide them the means and processes for collection and storage of these cells. Today, stem cell transplants are known and accepted treatments for approximately 80 diseases, a number of them life-threatening. With continued research in this area of medical technology, other therapeutic uses for cord blood stem cells are being explored. A vast majority of expectant parents are simply unaware that umbilical
cord blood contains a rich supply of non-controversial stem cells and that they can be collected, processed and stored for the potential future use of the newborn and possibly related family members. A baby’s stem cells are a perfect match for the baby throughout its life and have a 1-in-4 chance of being a perfect match and a 3-in-4 chance of being an acceptable match for a sibling. There is no assurance, however, that a perfect match means the cells could be used to treat certain diseases of the newborn or a relative. Today, it is still common for the cord blood (the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta) to be discarded at the time of birth as medical waste.
Despite the potential benefits of umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation, the number of parents of newborns participating in stem cell preservation is still relatively small compared to the number of births (four million per annum) in the United States. Some reasons for this low level of market penetration are the misperception of the high cost of stem cell storage and a general lack of awareness of the benefits of stem cell preservation programs. However, evolving medical technology could significantly increase the utilization of the umbilical cord blood for transplantation and/or other types of treatments. The Company believes it offers the highest quality, highest value service targeted to a broad base of the market. We intend to maximize our growth potential through our superior quality, value-driven competitive leadership position, product differentiation, an embedded client base, increased public awareness and accelerated market penetration.
Umbilical Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Services
 The Company markets its cord blood stem cell preservation services directly to expectant parents and by distributing information through obstetricians, pediatricians, childbirth educators, certified nurse-midwives and other related healthcare professionals. The Company believes that its revenues have been facilitated by a variety of referral sources, resulting from high levels of customer satisfaction. New expectant parent referrals during fiscal 2022 were provided by physicians, midwives and childbirth educators, and by client-to-client referrals and repeat clients storing the stem cells of their additional children.
The Company has a national sales force to increase its marketing activities with its clinical referral sources, including physicians, midwives and hospitals. Promotional activities also include advertisements in clinical journals and telemarketing activities. In addition, the Company exhibits at conferences, trade shows and other meetings attended by medical professionals. Significant portions of client referrals to the Company are from medical caregiver professionals.
 To increase awareness among expectant parent audiences, the Company continues to promote its service through internet marketing. Expectant parents have also received information via emails and internet marketing campaigns.
 The Company’s client support team advisors are available by telephone to enroll clients and educate both expectant parents and the medical community on the life-saving potential of cord blood stem cell preservation.
The Company continues to use its website, www.cryo-cell.com, to market its services and to provide resource information to expectant parents. The site, which is frequently updated and improved, is divided into areas of interest, including sections for expectant parents, medical caregivers and investors. Expectant parents may request and receive information about the umbilical cord blood and cord tissue service and enroll online. Viewers may read about successful transplants using Cryo-Cell stored cord blood stem cells and access other topical information. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 Growth in the number of families banking their newborn’s cord blood stem cells has been accompanied by an increasing landscape of competitors. The Company competes against approximately 25 other national private cord blood banks.
Some of these competitors may have access to greater financial resources. Nevertheless, the Company believes it is currently well positioned to compete in the industry. Importantly, the Company believes that some competitors charge more for comparable (or even inferior) quality service. In addition, the Company possesses an industry-recognized AABB accreditation, and believes that it was the first private cord blood bank to process in a cGMP- and cGTP-compliant facility exceeding current FDA requirements. During 2014, the Company was granted FACT (the Foundation for the Accreditation for Cellular Therapy) accreditation. These achievements position Cryo-Cell as an industry quality leader as a cGMP- and cGTP-compliant private cord blood bank with AABB and FACT accreditations.
The Company believes that its longevity and experience; value-based pricing strategy; superior customer service; premier technical and operational expertise; state-of-the-art facilities; innovative marketing programs and its expansive client base will continue to provide a competitive advantage.
Government Regulation
The Company is required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Service Act because of its ongoing cellular storage business and is subject to FDA inspection. This requirement applies to all establishments engaged in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (“HCT/Ps”) or the screening or testing of a cell or tissue donor. In addition, with the purchase of the manufacturing rights to the PrepaCyte CB Processing System on June 30, 2015, Cryo-Cell is required to register this product as a Medical Device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which is also subject to FDA inspection. At November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these requirements.
 The division of FDA which regulates HCT/Ps is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”). The section of FDA Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) pertaining to cord blood is 21 CFR 1271. Since 2004, the FDA has formulated a “Tissue Action Plan” which consists of these three rules:
 1.As of January 21, 2004, all cord blood banks are required to register with the FDA. Any cord blood bank which has a laboratory should be on the web page of FDA Registered Establishments.
 2.The second rule was published May 20, 2004, and became effective May 25, 2005. It pertains to donor eligibility. This rule requires more screening of donors for communicable diseases.
 3.The final rule establishes FDA standards of current Good Tissue Practice (“GTP”) for laboratories which process HCT/Ps. This rule was published November 19, 2004, became effective May 25, 2005, and is intended to prevent contamination or cross-contamination during the handling of HCT/Ps.
 These three FDA rules apply only to cord blood processed on or after the effective date of May 25, 2005. The final rule allows the FDA to inspect cord blood laboratories to determine compliance with the provisions of 21 CFR Part 1271. As part of this oversight authority, the FDA conducts unannounced inspections of cord blood banks.
 Upon execution of the acquisition of all of the assets of Cord:Use, the Company acquired the cord blood operations which included both public (PHS 351) and private (PHS 361) banks. The Company closed the Cord:Use location and maintains its operations in Oldsmar, FL. The new PHS 351 product is distributed under an IND (10-CBA) maintained by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). The Company has continued the contract with Duke University initiated by Cord:Use to manufacture, test, cryopreserve, store and distribute the public cord blood units. The units are listed on the NMDP Single Point of Access Registry and are available to transplant centers worldwide. The Company is reimbursed via cost recovery for public cord blood units distributed for transplant through the NMDP. The donation of cord blood units in the public cord blood banking program functions under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Company adheres to HIPAA rules. The FDA does not require establishments that manufacture drugs (including biological products) and devices that are HCT/Ps for use under an investigational new drug application (IND) (21 CFR Part 312) to register and list their HCT/Ps until the HCT/P is approved through a biologics license application (BLA), new drug application (NDA), or premarket approval application (PMA); or cleared through a premarket notification submission (510(k)).
The PrepaCyte CB (Cord Blood) Processing System is intended for use in cell processing laboratories to process and store total nucleated cells (TNC) from human umbilical cord blood, prior to banking. The device is composed of three integrally attached processing and storage containers with separation media or as a multi one-time use processing system. The system is 510(k) cleared as a Class II device. The division of the FDA which regulates this product is the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”). Approval to market the device was determined by the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies. The section of FDA Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) pertaining to medical device is 21 CFR 800s. The requirements for compliance to this section include annual registration of the device, listing of devices with the FDA, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
 Currently, the states of California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York require cord blood banks to be registered or licensed. The Company is currently registered or licensed to operate in these states. If the Company identifies other states with licensing requirements or if other states adopt such requirements, the Company would have to obtain licenses or registration to continue providing cord blood services in those states.
 Federal and state laws govern the Company’s ability to obtain and, in some cases, to use and disclose data that we may need to conduct certain activities. The HIPAA requires the Department of Health and Human Services
to issue a series of regulations establishing standards for the electronic transmission of certain health information. The Company’s private cord blood bank operation is not subject to HIPAA because the Company does not engage in certain electronic transactions related to the reimbursement of healthcare providers and because blood and tissue procurement and banking activities are exempt. However, the healthcare providers that collect umbilical cord blood for the Company’s customers are subject to HIPAA. The identifiable information shared is only what is permitted by HIPAA. In 2009, a portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”). While the Company is still not subject to HIPAA for the reasons stated above the Company may incur material expenses associated with compliance efforts. In addition, compliance may require management to spend substantial time and effort on compliance measures. If the Company fails to comply with HIPAA, it is possible it could suffer criminal and civil penalties. The civil penalties could include monetary penalties ranging from $100 per violation to $1.5 million depending on the level of violation.
 The Company is also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. These laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA"), cGTPs, cGMPs, Environmental Protection Act and those of the local Department of Health.
 OSHA requires all employers to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women through development and implementation of work standards, education, and training. OSHA enforces the standards developed under the Act, applicable to all employers in the U.S. and its territories. cGTPs are laws, enforced by the FDA, that define and govern methods used in the manufacture of Human Cells, Tissues, and cellular and tissue-based Products (HCT/Ps). Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) are laws, enforced by the FDA, that define and govern methods used in the manufacture of drugs and finished pharmaceuticals. Both of the latter federal practices, or laws, govern the Company’s products.
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) governs the management and proper disposal of products and by-products or waste. These products must be disposed in a manner that does not adversely affect the environment from which it came or where disposed of. The Department of Health on the local level primarily regulates systems and associated equipment employed in recovery activities such as back-up generators; therefore, governing specific internal processes.
 Evolving legislation and regulations governing private cord blood banking in various jurisdictions throughout the world may impact the Company’s international licensees.
 In addition, as the organization grows and evolves, other legislation and regulations are expected to impact the Company. One such evolution involves activities that may be designated as or involve medical research or cooperative agreements associated with medical research. These types of activities are also governed by the FDA, specifying oversight by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is a board or committee that approves the initiation of, and conducts periodic review of, biomedical research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of such review is to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Governance of biomedical research is codified as laws by Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56, and enforced by the FDA.  Other medical research associated with clinical trials may require an Investigational New Drug Application (IND). Current Federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because a sponsor will likely want to ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in many states, it must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The IND is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains this exemption from the FDA. This approval would be required in the case of a clinical trial.
 License Agreement with Duke University
 On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the “Duke Agreement”) with Duke, pursuant to which Duke has granted to the Company an exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, sell and otherwise commercially exploit (with the right to sublicense) certain licensed products and to practice certain licensed processes, and the exclusive right to use certain regulatory data and technical information in connection with such licensed patent rights, in the treatment, prevention, cure, reduction, mitigation or other management of certain diseases in humans, except, with regard to certain patent rights, in certain excluded fields of use and in certain territories, subject to Duke’s reserved rights to practice the licensed rights for all research, public service, internal (including clinical) and/or educational purposes.
Duke has completed or in progress a total of 19 FDA approved clinical trials related to the Duke License Agreement. The Company intends to fund additional clinical trials, as necessary, to provide the proof of efficacy that is required by the FDA to issue BLAs for some or all of the indications mentioned above.
 In addition, Duke has provided its manufactured MSCs for one arm of a four arm, placebo controlled, multi-site, double blinded Phase 3 clinical trial, run by Emory University to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, in which cells from three different sources are compared to the current standard of care. If the Duke MSCs prove to be the most efficacious, the Company intends to design and fund a Phase 3 registration trial for that indication. The readout from the Emory trial is expected in 2023.
 The Company purchased a 56,000 square feet facility in Durham in which it plans to open the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies. Previously, the FDA has granted Duke the right to treat certain patients with infusions of cord blood under its Expanded Access Program. The Company intends to file an IND to conduct a clinical trial for either cerebral palsy or autism and will ask for similar rights to treat pediatric patients with certain neurological disorders (such as CP or autism) at its clinic. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve of this or any IND filed by the Company.
 The Agreement extends until expiration of the last Royalty Term, unless sooner terminated as provided in the Agreement. Royalty Term generally means the period beginning on the first commercial sale of each licensed product or licensed process and ending fifteen (15) years thereafter. Upon expiration of the applicable Royalty Term with respect to a particular licensed product or licensed processes, the licenses and rights granted by Duke to the Company under the Agreement with respect to such product or process become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable.
 In accordance with the original Duke License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Duke a license fee equal to $12,000,000, of which $10,000,000 has been paid to date and an additional $2,000,000 was due on February 23, 2023. In addition, during the Royalty Term, subject to certain minimum royalties, the Company is required to pay Duke royalties based on a portion of the net sales varying from 7% - 12.5% based on volume. The Company is also obligated to pay certain legal fees and expenses associated with related patents.

On February 17, 2023, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the License Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) with Duke. The Second Amendment changes the license fee due to Duke. The final $2,000,000 payment that was due on February 23, 2023 was removed and the license fee is paid in full. The Second Amendment added a new milestone payment of $1,000,000 upon FDA approval of the first licensed product comprising cord tissue derived MSC (“ctMSC”) for autism spectrum disorder. The Second Amendment also added a new ctMSC milestone that the Company will open a manufacturing facility for the licensed product prior to the first initiation of a Phase III clinical trial using ctMSC’s. As part of the Second Amendment, the Company also agreed to enter into a sponsored research agreement (the “Research Agreement”) with Duke to provide funding to complete the Duke IMPACT Study. If the Research Agreement is not entered into by March 1, 2023, the Second Amendment will be voided and the License Agreement will be unchanged. The Company has executed the sponsored research agreement and is waiting for Duke’s signature. If fully executed, in consideration for the work to be performed under the Research Agreement, the Company will be obligated to make 14 equal monthly payments of $187,407 commencing in March or April, 2023 and a final payment of $187,400 upon the submission of a draft proposed publication for peer review and delivered to the Company of the completed IMPACT Study. Duke agrees this will be no later than September 30, 2024.
 Unless the Agreement is terminated or renegotiated as permitted per the Agreement, the Company is also required to pay Duke minimum annual royalties beginning on the second anniversary of the effective date as follows:
 •Year 2: $500,000
 •Year 3: $1,000,000
 •Year 4: $2,500,000
 •Year 5 and each year thereafter during the term of this Agreement: $5,000,000
 
In addition, the Company is required to pay Duke certain milestone payments, as follows:
 •$2,000,000 upon initiation of the first Phase III clinical trial for an indication other than Autism Spectrum Disorder, for a licensed product comprising cord tissue; and
 •A number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the corresponding percentage of the Company’s fully-diluted equity ownership outstanding as of February 23, 2021 as follows: 

(1)5.0% upon execution of the Agreement (which shares have been issued);
 (2)2.5% upon cumulative net sales of licensed product and licensed process of $10,000,000;
 (3)2.5% upon cumulative net sales of licensed product and licensed process of $75,000,000;
 (4)2.5% at each of the following market cap of the Company (based on a rolling 30-day average closing market cap) triggers:
 oEqual to or greater than $300,000,000, provided such trigger occurs within eighteen (18) months of February 23, 2021; and
 oEqual to or greater than $500,000,000, provided such trigger occurs within twenty-four (24) months of February 23, 2021.
 On February 4, 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to License Agreement (the "Amendment") with Duke. The Amendment changes the requirements of the Company with regard to the minimum annual royalties payable to Duke. As amended, the minimum annual royalties are as follows:
 •Year 3: $500,000
 •Year 4: $1,000,000
 •Year 5: $2,500,000
 •Year 6 and each year thereafter during the term of this Agreement: $5,000,000 
 The Amendment also changed the requirements of the Company to pay Duke certain milestone payments, as follows:
 •$2,000,000 two years after the first patient or subject is treated in the first Phase III clinical trial of a licensed product comprising cord tissue derived MSC for an indication other than Autism Spectrum Disorder.
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company capitalized $15,372,382 as a Duke Agreement which was considered to be an asset acquisition and which represented the costs to obtain the Duke Agreement, and also recorded a corresponding liability to Duke for the Duke Agreement. The costs that were capitalized as a Duke license agreement includes the present value of the $12,000,000 license fee, $3,585,172, or 409,734 shares, of the Company’s common stock transferred to Duke and certain acquisition costs. The Company is amortizing these costs over 16 years. As of the twelve months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $960,774 and $720,580, respectively, in amortization expense which is reflected in amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Through this Agreement, the Company intends to expand to a triad of core business units to include: (1) its cord blood bank and other storage services; (2) cord blood and cord tissue infusion clinic services initially under the FDA’s Expanded Access Program and in conjunction with the undertaking of cord blood and cord tissue clinical trials to obtain BLA approvals for new indications, and (3) biopharmaceutical manufacturing if BLA(s) are approved by the FDA. Due to equipment delivery delays, the Company is projecting to open the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies and begin infusing patients during fiscal 2024.
Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures
 Since its inception, Cryo-Cell has entered into a number of business activities through subsidiaries and joint ventures, including the following activities and those described under “International” below. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue, certain opportunities for global expansion, on a selective basis, in which operational synergies and economic potential align with Cryo-Cell’s strategic direction.
Revenue Sharing Agreements (“RSAs”)
 The Company entered into RSAs prior to 2002 with various third and related parties. The Company’s RSAs provide that in exchange for a non-refundable up-front payment, the Company would share for the duration of the RSA a percentage of its future revenue derived from the annual storage fees related to a certain number of specimens that originated from specific geographical areas. The RSAs have no definitive term or termination provisions. The sharing applies to the storage fees collected for all specified specimens in the area covered by the RSA up to the number covered in the RSA. When the number of specimens is filled, any additional specimens stored in that area are not subject to the RSA. As empty spaces result from attrition, the Company has agreed to fill them as soon as
possible. The Company reflects these up-front payments as long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company does not intend to enter into additional RSAs.
In the future, the Company could reverse the liability relating to the RSAs up-front payments over an appropriate period of time, based on the Company’s expectations of the total amount of payments it expects to pay to the other party under the particular RSA. However, the RSAs do not establish a finite term or time frame over which to estimate the total payments and the Company had not previously estimated and has concluded that it is not currently practicable to estimate the projected cash flows under the RSAs. At present, the Company intends to defer the reversal of the liability, until such time as these amounts can be determined. During the periods when the Company defers the reversal of the liability, the quarterly payments made during these periods are treated as interest expense, which is recognized as the payments become due. In future periods, if a portion of the liability can be de-recognized based on the effective interest method, the payments will be allocated between interest and amortization of the liability. As cash is paid out to the other party during any period, the liability would be de-recognized based on the portion of the total anticipated payouts made during the period, using the effective interest method. That is, a portion of the payment would be recorded as interest expense, and the remainder would be treated as repayment of principal, which would reduce the liability.
