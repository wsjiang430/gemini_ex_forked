ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Bally’s Corporation, a Delaware corporation, with global headquarters in Providence, Rhode Island, is referred to as the “Company,” “Bally’s,” “we,” “our” or “us.” Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “BALY.” 
Our Company
We are a global gaming, hospitality and entertainment company with a portfolio of casinos and resorts and online gaming businesses. We provide our customers with physical and interactive entertainment and gaming experiences, including traditional casino offerings, iCasino, online bingo, sportsbook and free-to-play (“F2P”) games.
As of December 31, 2022, we own and manage 15 land-based casinos and one horse racetrack in ten states across the United States (“US”) operating under the Bally’s brand. Our land-based casino operations include approximately 14,800 slot machines, 500 table games and 5,300 hotel rooms, along with various restaurants, entertainment venues and other amenities. In 2021, we acquired London-based Gamesys Group Ltd. (“Gamesys”) to expand our geographical and product footprints to include an iGaming business with well-known brands providing iCasino and online bingo experiences to our global online customer base with concentrations in Europe and Asia and a growing presence in North America. Our revenues are primarily generated by these gaming and entertainment offerings. We own and operate our proprietary software and technology stack, which is designed to allow us to provide consumers differentiated offerings and exclusive content.
Our Strategy and Business Developments
We seek to continue to grow our business by actively pursuing the acquisition and development of new gaming opportunities and reinvesting in our existing operations. We believe that interactive gaming represents a significant strategic opportunity for the future growth of Bally’s and we will continue to actively focus resources in markets that we believe will regulate iGaming. We seek to increase revenues at our casinos and resorts through enhancing the guest experience by providing popular games, restaurants, hotel accommodations, entertainment and other amenities in attractive surroundings with high-quality guest service. We believe that our recent acquisitions have expanded and diversified us from financial and market exposure perspectives, while continuing to mitigate our susceptibility to regional economic downturns, idiosyncratic regulatory changes and increases in regional competition.
We continue to make progress on the integration of our acquired assets and deploying capital on our strategic growth projects. Notable efforts in the current year include:
•In January 2022, we launched Bally Casino, an iCasino app, in New Jersey and in November 2022, we launched our first combined casino and sports book app, Bally Bet Sportsbook & Casino, in Ontario, Canada. We will continue to focus on jurisdictions where there are iCasino opportunities.
•In June 2022, we signed a host community agreement with the City of Chicago to develop Bally’s Chicago, a flagship, destination casino resort in downtown Chicago, Illinois. This agreement provides us with the exclusive right to operate a temporary casino, which is expected to open in the second half of 2023, while the permanent casino resort is constructed.
•On September 26, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Tropicana Las Vegas from Penn Entertainment, Inc. and Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), providing us with a presence on the Las Vegas Strip. 
•During 2022, we made significant progress on our capital improvement and expansion projects focused on gaming and non-gaming amenities at our Bally’s Atlantic City, Bally’s Lincoln and Bally’s Kansas City properties renovating hotel rooms, expanding our gaming floors and product offerings and introducing new restaurant concepts, spas and other customer experience venues.
•On January 3, 2023, we completed the sale-leaseback transaction for the land and real estate assets of Bally’s Tiverton and Hard Rock Biloxi for an aggregate consideration of $635 million. 
These steps have positioned us as a prominent, full-service, vertically integrated iGaming company, with physical casinos and online gaming solutions united under a single, leading brand. 
For further information on our recent acquisitions, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Brands
Bally’s Brand
Bally’s is an iconic brand. We performed extensive market research in which active gamers indicated an acute awareness of the brand, but not necessarily a high usage of brand products and gaming offerings. We have rebranded every casino and resort in our portfolio, except Hard Rock Biloxi, to build upon the deep legacy of the Bally’s brand.
Additionally, our research told us that gamers across the demographic age spectrum knew of Bally’s brand and identified with the gaming entertainment aspect of slot machines, pinball machines, video machines and casinos. We believe in the industrial logic and vision of Bally’s becoming a premier, truly integrated, omni-channel gaming company for both retail and online gamers. These insights form the key tenets of our integrated Bally Rewards program specifically to enable customers to utilize compelling rewards universally in our interactive and casino and resort environments.
Our Sinclair Broadcast Group (“Sinclair”) media affiliation adds to our comprehensive touchpoint strategy, which strengthens our ability to attract new customers to our integrated brand by showcasing Bally’s with millions of daily impressions.
We believe that our phased approach to the transformation of Bally’s brand was thoughtful and deliberate. There are exceptions to our rebranding initiative. For example, in the case of Hard Rock Biloxi, we decided to maintain the current “Hard Rock” naming rights arrangement. Nonetheless, Bally’s remains at the center of our strategy.
In summary, we remain focused in our continuing effort to rebirth Bally’s brand as a legendary, integrated brand, leveraging our casino and resort, interactive and media environments with a compelling rewards program to rival our competition.
Interactive Brands
We operate a suite of award-winning brands and are focused on building a diverse portfolio of distinctive and recognizable brands that deliver best-in-class platforms, player experiences and gaming content globally. Our brands are:
•iCasino brands include Bally Casino, Rainbow Riches Casino, Virgin Casino, Virgin Games, Megaways Casino, VIP Casino, Vera & John, InterCasino, Monopoly Casino, Yuugado, Casino Secret;
•Sportsbook brand is Bally Bet;
•F2P brand is Bally Play;
•Online bingo brands include Jackpotjoy, Double Bubble Bingo and Botemania;
•SportCaller, a F2P games content provider;
•Gamesys, an iCasino and online bingo platform provider and operator; and
•Telescope, a provider of real-time audience engagement solutions for live events, gamified second screen experiences and interactive livestreams.
Bally Sports Brand 
Inherent in our naming rights arrangement with Sinclair, our Bally Sports brand encompasses a lineup of 19 regional sports networks to position the Bally Sports brand to be a well-known participant in the sports media industry, producing award-winning live game coverage, while creating and innovating multiplatform content that engages millions of sports fans across the US. We are home to America’s most comprehensive regional sports media rights portfolio that includes more than half of the US-based Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League teams.
We believe Bally Sports represents the future of sports fandom. We are seeking to cultivate and engage the next generation of fans by pursuing opportunities to create an omni-channel entertainment experience with sports at its core. By leveraging the collective scale of our regional sports media rights portfolio, we will seek to develop engaging content across an ever-expanding ecosystem of platforms and devices, meeting fans at the intersection of technology and sports culture. We believe that Bally Sports’ investment in the gamification of sports will usher in a new era of live, interactive sports that will provide fans the opportunity to interact with games in real time, on a personalized level, creating a national lean-in experience.
Our Technology and Product Development
The heart of Bally’s real-money gaming solutions is the union of the Gamesys platform with Bally’s casinos and resorts and iGaming products. The combined casino, sports and additional online marketing assets provide social gaming, game development and marketing partnerships that integrate with the casinos and resorts creating an exciting and diverse gaming, hospitality and entertainment environment. Our investment in gaming platforms along with our talented technical and product development teams allowed Bally’s to launch Bally Casino New Jersey within two months of the Gamesys acquisition. In 2022, we rolled-out our new BallyBet 2.0 Product to Arizona, New York, Ontario and Indiana, all with expanded omni-channel marketing features.
Our investment in core disciplines across technology, analytics and marketing have allowed us to rapidly bring innovative new experiences to market and provide unique insights into our customer habits and their interactions with both offline and online experiences. The result has been a highly efficient marketing conversion and retention platform that combines online and offline opportunities.
Our product offerings comprise varying levels of proprietary and third-party software. Our proprietary platform binds together our product offerings, providing account management, responsible gaming, regulatory compliance and electronic wallet capabilities. Across our product offerings, we have endeavored to own the technology in-house for all critical components and to utilize a combination of new technologies, including data science and machine learning, to optimize conversion, efficiency and efficacy.
Our experience from the highly competitive European markets, especially in the UK, allows us to leverage advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning and retention capabilities across the online sports, casino and bingo product lines and to bring that expertise to our offline casinos and resorts. We have integrated the previous Bet.Works sports engine with the Gamesys casino platform, known as the Evolve platform, to create a seamless, high performance, efficient and effective online gaming product, BallyBet 2.0, that links our casinos and resorts activity with our iGaming products. Our continued investments into kiosk and player rewards recognize both online and offline activity and are at the forefront of our omni-channel strategy.
Bally’s core product offerings are built on integrated, proprietary account management technology. This technology provides users with access to their account history and a uniform identity verification system, which is critical in enabling navigation from our national audience to our iGaming and sportsbook products. Our internally developed machine learning and AI tools recommend games, rewards and payment options and payment amounts to best suit our player’s preferences. We use our AI and machine learning skills to also protect our players by working at the forefront of the industry in developing advanced systems to identify and manage problem gambling behaviors.
We are further investing in the Bally technology and product platform to achieve our vision of a seamless player journey between offline and online gaming and entertainment worlds that recognize and reward players through their entire lifetime whether in our casinos and resorts or online in any of our gaming and entertainment offerings. By leveraging our casinos and resorts, Sinclair partnership and iGaming products and brands, we strive to deliver an entirely new omni-channel gaming and entertainment experience to our customers.
We plan to invest in core disciplines across our technology, analytics and marketing platforms to bring new experiences to market and gain an understanding of our customers. We are focused on building a strong brand reputation to distinguish us from our competitors.
Marketing
The marketing efforts under the Bally’s brand are primarily executed through six funnels: Advertising, Direct Marketing, Player Development, Special Events and Promotions, Entertainment and the Bally Rewards loyalty program.
Our Casino Operations team plays a significant role in attracting and retaining our customers. Every customer who interacts with a process, such as an automated teller machine (ATM) or kiosk, or an employee is met with an attempt to garner a return visit and then, in turn, make a recommendation to family and friends. Hence “R2,” an abbreviation for “Return and Recommend,” is Bally’s marketing and casino operations mantra.
The funnels are as follows:
Advertising
Bally’s targets its demographics throughout the nation via radio, television, billboards, print, direct mail, email, digital and social media campaigns. We seek to target the right customer at the right time with the right message to increase brand awareness and drive business. We do modest image advertising, but more predominantly lean towards call-to-action messaging.
Direct Marketing
We use Direct Marketing to establish a personal relationship with customers. This form of marketing typically involves an offer and a call to action to incentivize an initial or additional casino visit or engagement with our iGaming products. Our focus on individual behavior, rather than broad segments (which have been the traditional industry approach), is designed to allow us to execute a “Precision Marketing Model.” We believe that we understand the influential attributes that attract players and, as a result, we can market to the point of diminishing returns while avoiding low-return spending.
Player Development
Player Development is our link to our premium customers. We utilize a process under the Precision Marketing Model that is designed to enable our team to efficiently manage sales efforts to attract customers. We believe the potential exists to engage increasingly more with our customers as they move throughout our brands. 
Special Events and Promotions
This category refers to the mass public promotions that are weaved into the marketing calendar in concert with Direct Marketing. Our casino marketing team seeks to leverage tried-and-true promotions that attract and entertain players in an effort to retain them for the long term.
Entertainment
The mission to attract and retain gamers is evident in our entertainment strategy. Bally’s headliner strategy is to entertain our customers while recovering the cost of the act through cash sales. Additional entertainment is offered at Bally’s lounges and bars and designed to support our branding mission which is based on offering an engaging and entertaining experience. 
Bally Rewards
Bally Rewards is our core loyalty program and was devised to establish consistency throughout Bally’s brand. Players earn tier points to achieve a tier status of Pro, Star, Superstar and ultimately Legend. We are developing the connectivity of this program by our “one card” linking systems, which universally link to all Bally’s casinos, resorts and our interactive business units. We are also planning to provide benefits outside of what is offered in our casinos and resorts to add value to the membership.
Interactive Cross Marketing
We design collaborative, cross-marketing campaigns that include direct mail, on-property marketing and VIP marketing in an effort to increase interactive sign-ups and introduce interactive players to our casinos and resorts. This cross-marketing campaign is currently being launched at Bally’s Atlantic City.
Competition 
The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of operators, including land-based casinos, riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, video lotteries, traditional lotteries, video gaming terminals at taverns in certain states, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of iGaming and daily fantasy sports gaming, increased sports betting and other forms of gaming in the US. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from many leisure and entertainment activities, including, for example: shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms in different parts of the US, in several Canadian provinces and on many lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the US and First Nations in Canada. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on competition.
Seasonality
Casino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Seasonal weather conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and may cause flooding and other effects that result in the closure of our properties. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our sports betting business may experience seasonality based on the relative popularity of certain sports at different times of the year.
Human Capital Resources 
Employee Relations, Diversity and Social Inclusion 
A driving factor of our success is the recruitment and retention of employees who are committed to providing outstanding guest service that promotes diversity, inclusion and respect. To promote and foster a culture of inclusion, our properties have hiring initiatives that are aimed at increasing diversity and promoting gender equality and we welcome employees of all backgrounds. The Company believes that in order to flourish in a competitive environment and global economy, all ideas must be on the table, and an environment that welcomes and includes diverse perspectives leads to success in business. 
We believe that by providing our employees with competitive pay and benefits, as well as opportunities for professional development, we can achieve our goals of attracting and retaining a diverse and engaged workforce. Our professional development efforts include robust training programs, at no cost to the employee, scholarships, and tuition reimbursement opportunities. In addition, we recently implemented a Management Development Program, which is designed to allow us to identify and promote high performing talent within our workforce. We also engage with our employees through a number of health and wellness programs which include, an annual wellness fair, annual flu shots, weight loss programs, quarterly fitness challenges, employee assistance program, student loan assistance, and weekly wellness communications providing helpful information on health initiatives.
We also believe in the importance of giving back to our communities and have several philanthropic initiatives, including fundraising events to support local charities and organizations and community service events. We encourage our employees to participate in these events and recognize their efforts and contributions in their respective communities. 
Labor Relations 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 10,500 employees. Most of our employees in Rhode Island, Nevada and New Jersey are represented by a labor union and are subject to collective bargaining agreements with us. As of December 31, 2022, we had 29 collective bargaining agreements covering 2,755 employees. Our collective bargaining agreements generally have three-or-five-year terms.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
Our approach to sustainability is underpinned by three pillars: (i) player well-being, (ii) people engagement and (iii) building a brighter future. 
Player well-being
•Formed the ESG Committee. (Senior level leadership across all areas of ESG)
•Achieved Gamecare Level 3 Accreditation, the highest RG accreditation available in the industry
•Donated $600,000 to the International Center for Responsible Gambling for research into the harms of gambling
•Joined and implemented the AGA’s “Have a Gameplan” campaign
People Engagement
•Measure and maintain high engagement levels utilizing an engagement index target
•Evolve our ways of working, embracing flexible and agile hybrid working models suited to roles
•Proactively support our employees’ holistic well-being
•Continue to hire, nurture and develop a diverse and inclusive workforce
•Continue to invest in learning and development of our employees
•Ensure our culture and values underpin everything we do
Building a Brighter Future
•Measured our global environmental impact across Bally’s
•In August 2022, Bally’s applied for a science based target confirming our commitment to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon-based emissions
•Bally’s supports delivery of six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
Government Gaming Regulation 
General
The casino and iGaming industries are highly regulated and we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate in order to continue operations. Each of our casino and iGaming businesses is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it operates. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions. 
Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports reflecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
Under gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restrictions on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. These restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities, or, if the holder refuses or is unable to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.
For a more detailed description of regulations to which we are subject, see Exhibit 99.1, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Our Regulatory Agreement
On February 17, 2022, certain of our subsidiaries, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (“DBR”) and the Division of Lotteries (“DoL”) of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue amended and restated our Regulatory Agreement (the “Regulatory Agreement”). The amendment and restatement of the Regulatory Agreement was mandated by legislation enacted in Rhode Island in June 2021. The Regulatory Agreement contains financial and other covenants that, among other things, (i) restrict the acquisition of stock and other financial interests in us, (ii) relate to the licensing and composition of members of our management and Board of Directors (the “Board”), (iii) prohibit certain competitive activities and related-party transactions and (iv) restrict our ability to declare or make restricted payments (including dividends), incur additional indebtedness or take certain other actions, if our leverage ratio exceeds 5.50 to 1.00 (in general being gross debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA, each as defined in the Regulatory Agreement). 
The Regulatory Agreement also provides affirmative obligations, including setting a minimum number of employees that we must employ in Rhode Island and providing the DBR and DoL with periodic information updates about us. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any properties in Rhode Island (other than Bally’s Twin River and Bally’s Tiverton), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire. A failure to comply with the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island.
In addition, our master contracts with Rhode Island were extended through June 30, 2043, and allow for consolidation of promotional points between Bally’s Twin River and Bally’s Tiverton, obligate Bally’s Twin River to build a 50,000 square foot expansion, obligate Bally’s to lease at least 20,000 square feet of commercial space in Providence, and commit us to invest $100 million in Rhode Island over this extended term, including an expansion and the addition of new amenities at Bally’s Twin River. The June 2021 legislation authorized Bally’s Twin River to become a licensed technology provider, which it did on July 1, 2021. As a licensed Technology Provider, Bally’s Twin River was entitled to an additional share of net terminal income on Video Lottery Terminals (“VLTs”) which they owned or leased. This June 2021 legislation also authorized a joint venture between Bally’s and International Gaming Technology PLC (“IGT”) to become a licensed technology provider and supply the State of Rhode Island with all VLTs at both Bally’s Twin River and Bally’s Tiverton for a 20.5-year period starting January 1, 2023. The joint venture was organized as the Rhode Island VLT Company, LLC, with IGT owning 60% of the membership interests and Bally’s or its affiliates owning 40% of the membership interests. On December 30, 2022 Bally’s Twin River and Bally’s Tiverton purchased additional machines directly from IGT to effectively own 40% of the machines. On January 1, 2023 Bally’s Twin River and Bally’s Tiverton contributed all of their machines to Rhode Island VLT Company, LLC in return for an aggregate 40% membership interest, and IGT contributed all of their machines at Bally’s Twin River and Bally’s Tiverton to the Rhode Island VLT Company, LLC in return for a 60% membership interest. 
Other Laws and Regulations
Our businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Intellectual Property
We develop intellectual property to differentiate our retail casinos and interactive products from our competitors. Our brands and technology constitute key business assets. In order to protect our brands, technology and other creative output, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyright, patents, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
Our core brand in the United States is Bally and Bally’s, which includes Bally’s Casino, Bally Bet, Bally Play and Bally Sports. The Bally brand is protected by around 75 trademark registrations and applications in the US and foreign jurisdictions. In line with our multi-brand strategy, we register trademarks for brands either directly exploited by us in the provision of interactive gaming services or for the purpose of licensing to third parties. Our other brands in the US include Live at the Bike and in foreign jurisdictions: Jackpotjoy, Botemania, Vera & John, Yuugado, Intercasino, and Casino Secret. In addition, we hold an exclusive trademark license for Hard Rock in relation to our Hard Rock, Biloxi casino. The Hard Rock license expires in 2025 with an option to renew for two successive ten-year terms. In foreign territories we hold a number of in-bound trademark licenses for our interactive gaming services. 
We create original software code and designs for our interactive gaming and betting services. Our software code is primarily protected by copyright and, to a lesser extent, patents. Although our business is not dependent on any one of our patents or combination of our patents, we file patent applications where we believe it is appropriate to do so. Our patent portfolio comprises approximately 20 granted US patents and we license in patented technology where required for the operation of our business. We protect our Trade Secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality clauses. 
While we take action to protect our intellectual property rights, there is always a risk that (i) our proprietary rights become invalidated or unenforceable, (ii) we are unsuccessful in obtaining trademark or patent registrations and (iii) we are unsuccessful in our enforcement efforts and therefore unable to prevent what we consider to be misuse of our intellectual property assets. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Further, third parties may independently develop similar brands and technologies which would negatively impact the value of our intellectual property.
