ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. (“Heidrick & Struggles”) is a human capital leadership advisory firm providing executive search, consulting and on-demand talent services to businesses and business leaders worldwide to help them improve the effectiveness of their leadership teams. When we use the terms “Heidrick & Struggles,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” in this Form 10-K, we mean Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. We provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of approximately 460 consultants located in major cities around the world. Heidrick & Struggles and its predecessors have been a leadership advisor for more than 65 years. Heidrick & Struggles was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1999 when two of our predecessors merged to form Heidrick & Struggles.
Our service offerings include the following:
Executive Search. We partner with our clients - respected organizations across the globe - to help them build and sustain the best leadership teams in the world, with a specialized focus on the placement of top-level senior executives. Through our 
unique relationship-based, data-driven approach, we help our clients find the right leaders, set them up for success, and accelerate their and their team’s performance.
We believe focusing on top-level senior executives provides the opportunity for several competitive advantages including access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search and consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility, and a leveraged global footprint. Working at the top of client organizations also facilitates the attraction and retention of high-caliber consultants who desire to serve top industry executives and their leadership needs. Our executive search services derive revenue through the fees generated for each search engagement, which generally are based on the annual compensation for the placed executive. We provide our executive search services primarily on a retained basis.
We employ a global approach to executive search built on better insights, more data and faster decision making facilitated by the use of our Heidrick Leadership Framework and Heidrick Connect. Our Heidrick Leadership Framework allows clients to holistically evaluate a candidate's pivotal experience and expertise, leadership capabilities, agility and potential, and culture fit and impact, thereby allowing our clients to find the right person for the role. We supplement our Heidrick Leadership Framework through a series of additional online tools including our Leadership Accelerator, Leadership Signature and Culture Signature assessments. Heidrick Connect, a completely digital, always available client experience portal, allows our clients to access talent insights for each engagement, including the Heidrick Leadership Framework and other internally developed assessment tools. In response to working remotely, our Executive Search teams employed Heidrick Connect to operate effectively and efficiently while engaging virtually with our clients. Additionally, we have introduced upgrades to Heidrick Connect, resulting in greater flexibility, increased productivity and the ability to deliver more insights to our clients.
The executive search industry consists of several thousand executive search firms worldwide. Executive search firms are generally separated into two broad categories: retained search and contingency search. Retained executive search firms fulfill their clients’ senior leadership needs by identifying potentially qualified candidates and assisting clients in evaluating and assessing these candidates. Retained executive search firms generally are compensated for their services regardless of whether the client employs a candidate identified by the search firm and are generally retained on an exclusive basis. Typically, retained executive search firms are paid a retainer for their services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, executive search firms often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. In contrast, contingency search firms are compensated only upon successfully placing a recommended candidate.
We are a retained executive search firm. Our search process typically consists of the following steps:

•Analyzing the client’s business needs in order to understand its organizational structure, relationships and culture, advising the client as to the required set of skills and experiences for the position, and identifying with the client the other characteristics desired of the successful candidate;
•Selecting, contacting, interviewing and evaluating candidates on the basis of experience and potential cultural fit with the client organization;
•Presenting confidential written reports on the candidates who potentially fit the position specification;
•Scheduling a mutually convenient meeting between the client and each candidate;
•Completing reference checks on the final candidate selected by the client; and
•Assisting the client in structuring compensation packages and supporting the successful candidate’s integration into the client team.
On-Demand Talent. Our on-demand services provide clients seamless, on-demand access to top independent talent, including professionals with deep industry and functional expertise for interim leadership roles and critical, project-based initiatives. Our unique model delivers the right independent talent on demand by blending proprietary data and technology with a dedicated Talent Solutions team. This segment represented less than 10% of our net revenue in 2022.
Heidrick Consulting. As a complement and extension of our search services, we partner with organizations through Heidrick Consulting to unlock the power of their people. Our tools and experts use data and technology to bring science to the art of human capital development and organizational design. Our services allow our clients to accelerate their strategies and the effectiveness of individual leaders, teams and organizations as a whole. 
Heidrick Consulting offers our clients impactful approaches to human capital development through a myriad of solutions, ranging from leadership assessment and development, team and organization acceleration, digital acceleration and innovation, diversity and inclusion advisory services, and culture shaping. Applying our deep understanding of the behaviors and attributes of leaders across many of the world’s premier companies, we guide our clients as they build a thriving culture of future-ready leadership. These premium services and offerings, which complement our Executive Search expertise, significantly contribute to our ability to deliver a full-service human capital consulting solution to our clients. 
We continue to focus on increasing the scale and impact of our Heidrick Consulting business and expect to improve the operating margins of this important business as we do so. Our consulting services generate revenue primarily through the professional fees generated for each engagement which are generally based on the size of the project and scope of services. Our Heidrick Consulting teams have pivoted to create new digital solutions for Leadership Assessments, Team Acceleration, and Organization and Culture Acceleration that can be delivered virtually in response to the hybrid work arrangements utilized by our clients around the world. This segment represented less than 10% of our net revenue in 2022.
Organization
Our organizational structure, which is arranged by geography, service offering and industry and functional practices, is designed to enable us to better understand our clients’ cultures, operations, business strategies, industries and regional markets for leadership talent.
Geographic Structure. We provide senior-level executive search and consulting services to our clients worldwide through a network of 55 offices in 30 countries including our affiliates in 2022. Each office size varies; however, major locations are staffed with consultants, research associates, administrative assistants and other support staff. Administrative functions are centralized where possible, although certain support and research functions are situated regionally because of variations in local requirements. We face risks associated with political instability, legal requirements and currency fluctuations in our international operations. Examples of such risks include difficulties in managing global operations, social and political instability, regulations and potential adverse tax consequences. For a more complete description of the risks associated with our business see the Section in this Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors”.
In addition to our wholly owned subsidiaries during 2022, our worldwide network included an affiliate relationship in South Africa. In 2023, we have hired the employees and ended our affiliate relationship in South Africa while also adding a new affiliate in Ukraine. We have no financial investment in this affiliate but receive licensing fees from them for the use of our name and our databases. Licensing fees were less than 1% of our net revenue in 2022.
Information by Geography. We operate our Executive Search services in three geographic regions, each of which is reported as a separate reporting segment: the Americas (which includes the countries in North and South America); Europe (which includes the continents of Europe and Africa); and Asia Pacific (which includes the region generally known as the Middle East). Our On-Demand Talent and Heidrick Consulting reporting segments operate globally.
Americas Executive Search. As of December 31, 2022, we had 203 consultants in our Americas segment. The largest offices in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are located in New York, Chicago, and Boston.
Europe Executive Search. As of December 31, 2022, we had 113 consultants in our Europe segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.
Asia Pacific Executive Search. As of December 31, 2022, we had 74 consultants in our Asia Pacific segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are Australia, China (including Hong Kong), and the United Arab Emirates.
On-Demand Talent. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United States and the United Kingdom.
Heidrick Consulting. As of December 31, 2022, we had 70 consultants in our Heidrick Consulting segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.
The relative percentages of net revenue attributable to each segment were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Executive Search | | | | | 
Americas | 57 | % | | 58 | % | 58 | %
Europe | 16 | % | | 17 | % | 20 | %
Asia Pacific | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 13 | %
On-Demand Talent | 9 | % | | 7 | % | — | %
Heidrick Consulting | 7 | % | | 7 | % | 9 | %

For financial information relating to each segment, see Note 18, Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Global Industry Practices. Our executive search and consulting businesses operate in six broad industry groups listed below. These industry categories and their relative sizes, as measured by billings for 2022, 2021 and 2020, are as follows:

 | Percentage of Billings
Global Industry Practices | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Financial Services | 27 | % | | 27 | % | 25 | %
Global Technology & Services | 23 | | | 23 | | 21 | 
Industrial | 20 | | | 20 | | 20 | 
Consumer Markets | 16 | | | 15 | | 17 | 
Healthcare & Life Sciences | 11 | | | 13 | | 14 | 
Social Impact | 3 | | | 2 | | 3 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Within each broad industry group are a number of industry sub-sectors. Consultants often specialize in one or more sub-sectors to provide clients with market intelligence and candidate knowledge specific to their industry. For example, within the Financial Services sector, our business is diversified amongst a number of industry sub-sectors including Asset & Wealth Management, Consumer & Commercial Finance, Commodities, Corporate and Transaction Banking, Global Markets, Hedge Fund, Infrastructure, Investment Banking, Insurance, Private Equity Investment Professionals and Real Estate.
We service our clients with global industry interests and needs through unified global executive search teams who specialize in industry practices. This go-to-market strategy allows us to leverage our global diversity and market intelligence and is designed to provide better client service. Each client is served by one global account team, which we believe is a key differentiator from our competition.
Global Functional Practices. Our Executive Search consultants also specialize in searches for specific “C-level” functional positions, which are roles that generally report directly to the chief executive officer.
Our Global Functional Practices include Chief Executive Officer & Board of Directors; Human Resources Officers; Financial Officers; Information and Technology Officers; Legal, Risk, Compliance & Government Affairs; Marketing, Sales and Strategy Officers; and Supply Chain and Operations.
Our team of Executive Search consultants may service clients from any of our offices around the world. For example, an executive search for a chief financial officer of an industrial company located in the United Kingdom may involve an executive search consultant in the United Kingdom with an existing relationship with the client, another executive search consultant in the United States with expertise in our Industrial practice and a third executive search consultant with expertise in recruiting chief financial officers. This same industrial client may also engage us to perform skill-based assessments for each of its senior managers, which could require the expertise of one of our leadership advisory consultants trained in this service.
Client Base
For many of our clients, our global access to and knowledge of regional and functional markets and candidate talent is an important differentiator of our business. Our clients generally fall into one of the following categories:

•Fortune 1000 companies;
•Major U.S. and non-U.S. companies;
•Middle market and emerging growth companies;
•Private equity firms;
•Governmental, higher education and not-for-profit organizations; and
•Other leading private and public entities.
Clients and Marketing
Our consultants market the firm’s executive search and consulting services through two principal means: targeted client calling and industry networking with clients and referral sources. These efforts are supported by proprietary databases, which provide our consultants with information as to contacts made by their colleagues with particular referral sources, candidates and clients. In addition, we benefit from a significant number of referrals generated by our reputation for high quality service and successfully completed assignments, as well as repeat business resulting from our ongoing client relationships.
In support of client calling and networking, the practice teams as well as individual consultants also author and publish articles and white papers on a variety of leadership and talent topics and trends around the world. Our consultants often present research findings and talent insights at notable conferences and events as well. Our insights are sometimes acknowledged by major media outlets and trade journalists. These efforts aid in the marketing of our services as well.
Either by agreement with the client or to maintain strong client relationships, we may refrain from recruiting certain employees of a client for a specified period of time taking into account the scope, size and length of the engagement, as well as the client relationship. Such restrictions allow us to strengthen and deepen our advisory engagement with clients, and we believe they remain manageable given their tailoring, such that we continue to be able to conduct searches effectively notwithstanding certain off-limits arrangements. 
No single client accounted for more than 1% of our net revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, our top ten clients in aggregate accounted for approximately 6% in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Information Management Systems
We rely on technology to support our consultants and staff in the search process. We employ a global approach to executive search built on better insights, more data and faster decision making facilitated by the use of our proprietary Heidrick Leadership Framework and Heidrick Connect. Our Heidrick Leadership Framework allows clients to holistically evaluate a candidate's pivotal experience and expertise, leadership capabilities, agility and potential, and culture fit and impact, thereby allowing our clients to find the right person for the role. We supplement our Heidrick Leadership Framework through a series of additional online tools including our Leadership Accelerator, Leadership Signature and Culture Signature assessments. Heidrick Connect, a completely digital, always available, client experience portal allows our clients to access talent insights for each engagement, including the Heidrick Leadership Framework and other proprietary assessment tools. In response to working remotely, our Executive Search teams employed Heidrick Connect to operate effectively and efficiently while engaging virtually with our clients. Additionally, we have introduced upgrades to Heidrick Connect, resulting in greater flexibility, increased productivity and the ability to deliver more insights to our clients. 
Our consulting business’ proprietary Web-based system, Culture Connect, is integral to the culture-shaping process. This technology platform enables our consultants to administer, analyze and interpret online Corporate Culture Profiles™ surveys to develop clarity around team and organizational need and desired outcomes. In addition, we gather data using our online Culture Impact Survey™ to determine which culture-shaping concepts are being utilized by individuals and the team as a whole. Our Heidrick Consulting teams have pivoted to create new digital solutions for Leadership Assessments, Team Acceleration, and 
Organization and Culture Acceleration that can be delivered virtually in response to the hybrid work arrangements utilized by our clients around the world.
Competition
The executive search industry is highly competitive. While we face competition to some degree from all firms in the industry, we believe our most direct competition comes from four established global retained executive search firms that conduct searches primarily for the most senior-level positions within an organization. In particular, our competitors include Egon Zehnder International, Korn Ferry, Russell Reynolds Associates, and Spencer Stuart. To a lesser extent, we also face competition from smaller boutique firms that specialize in certain regional markets or industry segments, internet-based firms and social media. Additionally, our clients or prospective clients may decide to perform executive searches using in-house personnel. Each of the competitors is also a competitor in the marketplace for effective search consultants.
Overall, the search industry has relatively few barriers to entry; however, there are higher barriers to entry to compete with global retained executive search firms that can provide leadership consulting services at the senior executive level. At this level, clients rely more heavily on a search firm’s reputation, global access and the experience level of its consultants. We believe that the segment of executive search in which we compete is more quality-sensitive than price-sensitive. As a result, we compete on the level of service we offer, reflected by our client services specialties and, ultimately, by the quality of our search results. We believe that our emphasis on senior-level executive search, the depth of experience of our search consultants and our global presence enable us to compete favorably with other executive search firms.
Competition in the leadership consulting and on-demand talent markets in which we operate is highly fragmented, with no universally recognized market leaders.
Seasonality
There is no discernible seasonality in our business. Revenue and operating income have historically varied by quarter and are hard to predict from quarter to quarter. In addition, the volatility in the global economy and business cycles can impact our quarterly revenue and operating income.
Human Capital Resources
As a premier provider of global leadership advisory services including executive search, consulting and on-demand talent services, people are at the center of all we do. Building a more diverse and inclusive firm is a strategic priority, and our culture is a key differentiator we have to attract, develop and retain the highest-performing talent. 
Employee Summary. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 2,141 individuals, represented by 1,277 in the Americas, 563 in Europe, and 301 in Asia Pacific. Our headcount includes 460 consultants (390 related to Executive Search and 70 related to Heidrick Consulting), 615 associates and 1,066 other search, consulting, on-demand talent, support, and Global Operations Support employees.
Within Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting, our professionals are generally categorized either as consultants or associates. Associates assist consultants by providing research support, coordinating candidate contact and performing other engagement-related functions. We promote our associates to consultants during the annual consultant promotion process, initially to Principals and ultimately Partners, and we recruit our consultants from other executive search or human capital firms, or in the case of executive search, consultants new to search who have worked in industries or functions represented by our practices. In the latter case, these are often seasoned executives with extensive contacts and outstanding reputations who are entering the search profession as a second career and whom we train in our techniques and methodologies. Our Heidrick Consulting consultants are recruited for their executive business experience as well as their skills in consulting and leadership advisory and often are former clients who are familiar with our consulting methodology. We are not a party to any U.S. or non-U.S.-based collective bargaining agreement, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Diversity Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”). We believe our success is grounded in how we operate each and every day as individual professionals and, collectively, as a firm. Our commitment to DEI is a key strategic imperative that is deeply rooted in our organizational Values: Respect and value each individual; Grow with our clients; Win as one firm; Always act with integrity; and Own the results. These Values guide us in how we approach our business, how we treat our colleagues and clients, and how we help build trust and a common understanding of what we stand for and believe in as a firm.
As part of this, we are committed to fostering an inclusive workforce, where all professionals from diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to make meaningful contributions. Our long-term DEI commitments span multiple years and we hold ourselves accountable by measuring our own diversity and inclusion achievements year over year, closely monitoring and tracking our progress. Our commitment to hold ourselves accountable by measuring our own diversity and inclusion is demonstrated by our achievements as of December 31, 2022:
•Women represent 63% of our overall workforce, 64% of our new hires(1) for the year and 64% of our promotions globally for the year.
•People of color(2) represent 26% of our overall U.S. workforce, 33% of our new hires(1) for the year and 18% of our promotions for the year.

•Our Regional Leader, Americas is a Black woman; our Chief Diversity Officer is a Black woman; and our Regional Leader, Europe is a woman.
•The leaders of our Americas CEO & Board practice and global DEI practice are Black men; our Managing Partner, Culture Shaping is a Hispanic woman.
•The Managing Partner of our Global Technology & Services practice is a Hispanic man.

Diversity, equity and inclusion are imperative for our internal culture and integral to driving our firm’s innovation and future growth. We have committed substantial time and resources to advance diversity in our workforce and create a culture of inclusion, where everyone feels valued and supported and encouraged to meaningfully contribute to our success through authentic participation. By cultivating a culture that brings the maximum range of ideas and experiences to our work with clients around the world, we believe we create better solutions for our clients’ business challenges and win as one firm.
In 2022, our DEI efforts were comprised of many initiatives, including:
•Appointed Cecilia Nelson-Hurt as Chief Diversity Officer to lead the firm’s employee-focused DEI strategy and deliver long-term, sustainable programs that build on our Values and commitment to creating the most diverse and inclusive global leadership advisory firm in the industry.
•Continued to support our Accelerating Women’s Excellence ("AWE") program as part of our ongoing commitment to promote gender parity in leadership roles and foster a strong culture of sponsorship by both men and women. In 2022, 52% of Partner promotions were women, and 63% of Principal promotions were women.
•Continued firm-wide DEI learning content through our Inclusive Culture Learning Journeys – a monthly collection of content for our employees to broaden their knowledge around the topics of diversity, inclusion and integrity. Each month, we introduced a new theme and shared relevant articles and learning resources focused on strengthening our inclusive culture and aligning with our Values.
•Our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") exemplify our people-first approach and represent a safe space for employees to promote and celebrate affinity and community while providing the firm a window into what the groups represented need. Each month the various ERGs at the Company offer educational programming and networking opportunities to engage and develop employees. 
Employee Engagement. In June 2022, we launched a new Voice of Employee pulse survey platform that offers employees the opportunity to regularly and confidentially share feedback on their experience at Heidrick & Struggles and provides our leaders with additional data on how they can best lead their teams. We use the tool to evaluate three areas of the employee experience: Engagement, Diversity & Inclusion, and Health & Wellbeing. Data from the surveys is shared anonymously with key leaders across geographies, practices and businesses. Additionally, the platform allows us to track our progress and better understand how we are doing in our efforts, while using others in the industry as benchmarks.
Learning & Development. We are committed to the professional development of our employees and promoting a continuous learning culture within our firm. Our learning and development programs have been created with the goal of building leadership, business development, account management, client service, and change leadership skills among our employees. In addition to building personal and professional capabilities, these programs set a standard for the behaviors we believe will help us realize our business goals and strategies.
In 2022, our Learning & Development team delivered over 17,900 hours of aggregate live training to our colleagues globally. Our programming was deployed in both virtual and in-person formats. Our learning catalog outlines dozens of live and virtual programs as well as thousands of eLearning courses designed to help build and enhance employee leadership, business acumen and business development skills. These programs are continually updated to reflect best practices and feedback received from employees.
As we strive to build an unrivaled culture for high-performing talent at Heidrick & Struggles, our firm’s leaders continue to play a central role in this work, and we are further investing in our firm’s own leadership capabilities. This includes the launch of a new transformational leadership development program, which is designed to help our leaders maximize their impact in the rapidly evolving workplace and build upon existing leadership skills and experiences, focusing on resilience, vulnerability, trust, and living our firm’s values. In 2022, we launched six cohorts and 119 senior level employees went through the program. The program is a multi-year investment in our leadership that we plan to cascade across multiple cohort groups throughout the organization. 
Participation in our Communities. We are proud members and eager participants in supporting the communities where we live and work. We know first-hand from our client work the positive eﬀects that strong leaders can bring to both organizations and communities and encourage employees to contribute to our communities as well.
The Company formed a Global Philanthropic Committee in 2019 to establish a coordinated, global approach to supporting the philanthropic causes and endeavors that impact our employees, clients and communities. In 2022, employees participated in our 4th Global Day of Service where colleagues in over 40 offices around the world donated over 2,400 hours. We also support our employees who bring attention to philanthropic causes and organizations that they engage with independently. 
Compensation and Benefits. Our goal is not only to challenge our employees to reach their potential professionally, and reward them for great work, but also to understand and consider their need to be simultaneously healthy, balanced and focused. We believe in fair compensation, based upon demonstrated capabilities and achievement, experience and superior performance. We place great importance on incentivizing, recognizing and rewarding performance and behaviors aligned with our Values in the form of discretionary bonus awards. Through our benefits program, we demonstrate commitment to fostering an environment in which employees are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Our benefits are administered on a country-by-country basis, so that benefits are comparable to other employers within each jurisdiction and our industry. We use several measures to ensure that our benefits offerings are up-to-date, competitive in the marketplace, and in line with employee needs, including employee surveys, benchmarking exercises, and other benefits measurement tools. Benefits offered to our employees may include annual leave and other paid time off, medical, dental and vision benefits, prescription drug benefits, flexible spending accounts, employee assistance programs, 401(k) and deferred compensation retirement programs, short and long-term disability insurance, critical illness insurance and life insurance.
Employee Health and Safety. We continue to focus on helping to ensure the health and safety of our employees, clients and the communities where we live and work around the globe. In late 2022, we expanded our flexible working philosophy to provide additional guidance to managers and employees across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific on our evolving approach to a hybrid work environment. Our employees have the flexibility to work remotely part of the week, with variations depending upon location and role, and we encourage teams to structure their schedules for a purposeful return to office. We are committed to ensuring our people can safely follow country- and state-level health guidance, while also having the opportunity to grow professionally and personally through in-person collaboration and development.

Ethics. Employees are encouraged to speak to their colleagues and representatives in Legal and Human Resources whenever an ethical question or situation arises. We also have established the Heidrick & Struggles EthicsLine, a service that provides a mechanism for reporting alleged breaches of any legal or regulatory obligations, financial fraud, including with respect to accounting, internal controls and auditing, or any alleged violation of the Code of Ethics or corporate policies to the Company. The EthicsLine is a web-based and telephonic reporting hotline available to all Company employees, contractors, vendors, stockholders, clients, or other interested parties.

Regulation
We are subject to the U.S. securities laws and general corporate and commercial laws and regulations of the locations which we serve. These include regulations regarding anti-bribery, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, data security, data retention, personal information, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, and classification of workers as 
employees or independent contractors, which is especially relevant to our On-Demand Talent segment. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States.
