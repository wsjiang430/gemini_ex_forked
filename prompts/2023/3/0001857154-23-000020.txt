Item 1. Business
The Joy of Krispy Kreme 
Krispy Kreme, Inc. (“KKI”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Krispy Kreme”) is one of the most beloved and well-known sweet treat brands in the world. Our iconic Original Glazed® doughnut is universally recognized for its hot-off-the-line, melt-in-your-mouth experience. Over its 85-year history, Krispy Kreme has developed a broad consumer base globally and currently operates in over 30 countries through its unique network of fresh Doughnut Shops, partnerships with leading retailers, and a rapidly growing Ecommerce and delivery business. Our purpose of touching and enhancing lives through the joy that is Krispy Kreme guides how we operate every day and is reflected in the love we have for our people, our communities, and the planet.
We are a global omni-channel business with more than 11,800 Global Points of Access, creating awesome fresh doughnut experiences via (1) our Hot Light Theater and Fresh Shops, (2) Delivered Fresh Daily (“DFD”) branded cabinets and merchandising units within high traffic grocery and convenience stores, (3) Ecommerce and (4) our Branded Sweet Treat Line. We have a capital-efficient Hub and Spoke model, which leverages our Hot Light Theater Shops’ production capabilities and Doughnut Factories to deliver fresh doughnuts daily to local Fresh Shops, DFD Doors, and through Ecommerce channels. We seek to increase our Sales per Hub through innovation, marketing campaigns and increasing physical availability to our fresh doughnuts from our Hubs to new Points of Access, primarily DFD Doors. Additionally, our convenient Ecommerce platform and delivery capability are significant enablers of our omni-channel growth. 
We also launched in mid-2020 our Branded Sweet Treat Line, a new line of Krispy Kreme-branded packaged sweet treats intended to extend our consumer reach with shelf-stable, high quality products available through grocery, mass merchandise,

and convenience locations. In addition to creating awesome doughnut experiences, we create “cookie magic” through Insomnia Cookies, which specializes in warm, delicious cookies delivered right to the doors of its consumers, along with an innovative portfolio of cookie cakes, ice cream, cookie-wiches, and brownies. Insomnia Cookies is a digital-first concept with over 40% of its sales driven through Ecommerce in fiscal 2022. Targeting affordable, high-quality emotional indulgence experiences is at the heart of both the Krispy Kreme and Insomnia Cookies brands. 
Our current business model, which focuses on fresh daily premium quality doughnuts produced by the capital-efficient Hub and Spoke model, primarily via Company controlled shops is in contrast to the Krispy Kreme operating model prior to 2016, which was focused on retail and legacy wholesale channels (including discounted long shelf-life doughnuts and coffeehouse execution), a capital-heavy Hot Light Theater Shop production model, and primarily via franchisee controlled shops. We now focus on limited time offerings (“LTOs”) and seasonal occasions to generate buzz for our premium products. A taste of our offerings includes:
The Ingredients of Our Success 
We believe the following competitive differentiators position us to generate significant growth as we continue towards our goal of becoming the most loved sweet treat brand in the world. 
Beloved Global Brand with Ubiquitous Appeal 
We believe that our brand love and ubiquitous appeal differentiate us from the competition. We believe that Krispy Kreme is an iconic, globally recognized brand with rich history that is epitomized by our fresh Original Glazed doughnut. We are one of the most loved sweet treat retailers in the U.S. and many markets around the world. We are the most loved sweet treat brand in several key countries already in fiscal 2022, such as the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, based on the results of Krispy Kreme’s Annual Global Brand Tracking Survey conducted by Service Management Group based on over 17,000 consumer responses with Krispy Kreme achieving the highest percentage of consumers indicating they “ten: absolutely love the brand for sweet treats” on a ten point scale. We have an extremely loyal, energetic, and emotionally connected consumer base. 
We continuously seek to understand what consumers are celebrating or experiencing in their lives and actively engage our passionate followers to activate this emotional connection through memorable, sharable moments – our “Acts of Joy” – which we believe further fuel our brand love.
Creating Awesome Experiences 
We provide authentic indulgent experiences, delivering joy through high quality doughnuts made from our own proprietary formulations. Our strict quality standards and uniform production systems ensure the consumer’s interaction with Krispy Kreme is consistent with our brand promise, no matter where in the world they experience it. We aim to create product experiences that 
Table of Contents

align with seasonal and trending consumer interests and make positive connections through simple, frequent, brand-focused offerings that encourage shared experiences. 
We utilize seasonal innovations, alongside the expansion of our core product offering, to inspire consumer wonder and keep our consumers engaged with the brand and our products. Our sweet treat assortment begins with our iconic Original Glazed doughnut inspired by our founder’s classic yeast-based recipe that serves as the canvas for our product innovation and ideation. Using the Original Glazed doughnut as our foundation, we have expanded our offerings to feature everyday classic items such as our flavor glazes and “minis,” which lend themselves well to gifting occasions such as birthdays and school activities. Our “Original Filled” rings offer the benefits of a filled shell doughnut without the mess. Our seasonal items create unique assortments centered on holidays and events, with Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, the Fourth of July, Halloween, and Christmas, all examples of holidays for which we routinely innovate. We also maintain brand relevance by participating in significant cultural moments. We strategically launch offerings tied to these historic moments to gain mind share, grow brand love, and help drive sales. 
Leveraging our Omni-Channel Model to Expand Our Reach 
We believe our omni-channel model, enabled by our Hub and Spoke approach and Ecommerce, allows us to maximize our market opportunity while ensuring control and quality across our suite of products. Our goal is to provide our fresh doughnuts to consumers as conveniently and efficiently as possible. We apply a tailored approach across a variety of distinct shop formats to grow in discrete, highly attractive and diverse markets, and maintain brand integrity and scarcity value while capitalizing on significant untapped consumer demand. Many of our shops offer drive-thrus, which also expand their off-premises reach. Our Hot Light Theater Shops’ production capacity allow us to leverage our investment by efficiently expanding to our consumers wherever they may be — whether in a local Fresh Shop, in a grocery or convenience store, on their commute home or directly to their doorstep via home delivery. 
Hub and Spoke 
• Hot Light Theater Shops and other Hubs: Immersive and interactive experiential shops which provide unique and differentiated consumer experiences while serving as local production facilities for our network. The average capital investment for a Hot Light Theater Shop is $2 million to $4 million.
•Fresh Shops: Smaller doughnut shops and kiosks, without manufacturing capabilities, selling fresh doughnuts delivered daily from Hub locations. The average capital investment for a Fresh Shop is $0.1 million to $1 million.
• Delivered Fresh Daily: Krispy Kreme branded doughnut cabinets within high traffic grocery and convenience locations, selling fresh doughnuts delivered daily to more than 9,800 doors from Hub locations. The average capital investment for a DFD Door is $2,000 to $10,000.
• Ecommerce and Delivery: Fresh doughnuts for pickup or delivery, ordered via our branded Ecommerce platforms or through third-party digital channels.
Table of Contents

The Hub and Spoke approach is applied globally and is currently most developed in our international Company-owned markets such as the U.K., Australia and Mexico. We are in process of applying lessons learned in those international markets to the U.S., and particularly to expansion in top growth markets such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, among others, which we expect to be a significant driver of margin expansion in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Japan, and in new countries we plan to enter in the future. 
Branded Sweet Treat Line 
Our Krispy Kreme branded packaged sweet treat line offers a delicious, quality experience free of artificial flavors. This new line of products is distributed in the U.S. through major grocery, mass merchandise, and convenience locations, allowing us to capture the sweet snacking occasion for our customers seeking more convenience. 
Insomnia Cookies
Insomnia Cookies has expanded our sweet treat platform to include a complementary brand rooted in the belief that indulgent experiences are better enjoyed together. Insomnia Cookies delivers warm, delicious cookies right to the doors of individuals and companies alike.
Our Segments
We conduct our business through the following three reported segments: 
•U.S. and Canada: Includes all our Krispy Kreme Company-owned operations in the U.S. and Canada, Insomnia Cookies shops, and the Branded Sweet Treat Line; 
•International: Includes all our Krispy Kreme Company-owned operations in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico; and

Our Growth Strategies 
We have made investments in our brand, our people and our infrastructure and believe we are well positioned to drive sustained growth as we execute on our strategy. Across our global organization, we have built a team of talented and highly engaged Krispy Kremers and Insomnia employees (or “Insomniacs”). Over the past several years we have taken increased control of the U.S. operations to enable execution of our omni-channel strategy, including accelerating growth across our doughnut shops, DFD, Ecommerce and Branded Sweet Treat Line. Globally, we have developed an operating model that sets the foundation for continued expansion in both existing and new geographies. As a result, we believe we are able to combine a globally recognized and loyalty-inspiring brand with a leading management team and we aim to unlock increased growth in sales and profitability through the following strategies: 
• Increase purchase frequency; 
• Expand availability; and 
• Drive Hub and Spoke productivity and improve capital efficiency. 
Increase purchase frequency 
Almost all consumers desire an occasional indulgence, and when they indulge, they want a high quality, emotionally differentiated experience. We believe we have significant runway to be part of a greater number of shared indulgence occasions. On average, U.S. consumers visit Krispy Kreme less than three times per year, creating a significant frequency opportunity. The success of recently launched products, including filled rings and minis, seasonal favorites, limited time buzz-worthy offerings, and flavored glazes, affirms our belief that our innovations create greater opportunities for consumers to engage with our brand. We intend to strengthen our product portfolio by centering further innovation around seasonal and societal events, and through the development of new innovation platforms to drive sustained baseline growth. Our strategy of linking product launches with relevant events has allowed us to effectively increase consumption occasions while meaningfully engaging with our communities and consumers. 
Our marketing and innovation efforts have expanded the number of incremental consumer use cases for Krispy Kreme doughnuts. For example, our gifting value proposition makes doughnuts an ideal way to celebrate everyday occasions like birthdays and holidays, through gifting sleeves and personalized gift messaging. Our gifting value proposition fulfills distinct consumption occasions and will continue to make our brand and products more accessible and allow us to participate with greater frequency in small and large indulgent occasions, from impromptu daily gatherings with family and friends to holidays and weddings, and everything in between. 
Expand availability
We believe there are opportunities to continue to grow in new and existing markets in which we currently operate by further capitalizing on our strong brand awareness as we deploy our Hub and Spoke model. We apply a deliberate approach to growing these discrete, highly attractive markets and maintain our brand integrity and scarcity value while unlocking significant consumer demand. We focus on increasing Global Points of Access through low cost DFD Doors as well as investments in Fresh Shops with a limited number of investments in our experiential Hot Light Theater shops to implement the Hub and Spoke model in new and existing markets. This will lead to growth in our key Sales per Hub metric as we further leverage the production capacity of existing Hubs.
We believe our omni-channel strategy, empowered by our Hub and Spoke model, will allow us to effectively seize expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally. Despite our high brand awareness, we have a limited presence in certain key U.S. markets, such as New York and Chicago, and have yet to build a presence in key U.S. cities, including Boston and Minneapolis. We also believe we have a significant opportunity to increase our presence in our existing international markets such as Mexico, Japan, and Ireland where we have a less developed Hub and Spoke system. We believe this provides us ample opportunity to grow within markets in which we are already present. We also view Hub and Spoke expansion to other international markets where we do not currently have a presence as a major growth driver for the future. We have identified key international whitespace market opportunities such as China, Brazil, and parts of Western Europe. Our goal is to open in at least three new countries per year. Our proven track record of entering new diverse markets across multiple continents and deploying the capital-efficient Hub and Spoke approach demonstrates our ability to effectively penetrate a broad range of market types. New markets will either consist of Company-owned shops or entered via franchise operations (sometimes with us holding a minority equity interest), to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Drive Hub and Spoke productivity and improve capital efficiency
We are making focused investments in our omni-channel strategy to expand our presence efficiently while driving top-line growth, margin expansion, and capital efficiency. The Hub and Spoke model enables an integrated approach to operations, which is designed to bring efficiencies in production, distribution and supervisory management while ensuring product freshness and quality are consistent with our brand promise no matter where consumers experience our doughnuts. By expanding Points of Access such as new local DFD Doors to existing Hubs, we increase not just total Sales per Hub, but also profitability and capital efficiency because the production Hubs have largely fixed costs including rent, utilities, and even labor.
To support the Hub and Spoke model in the U.S., we have implemented new labor management systems and processes in our shops and new delivery route optimization technology to support our DFD logistics chain. In addition, we launched a new demand planning system that is intended to improve service and to deliver both waste and labor efficiencies across all our business channels. We are also investing in automation in the doughnut production process, including filling and icing doughnuts, which are done manually today. By streamlining these operations across our platform, we believe we can continue to deliver on our brand promise and provide joy to our consumers while continuing to drive efficiencies across our platform. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We are committed to making a positive impact on the world — to touch and enhance lives through the joy that is Krispy Kreme — and our ambition is to Be Sweet in All That We Do, which represents our corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) platform. With this platform, we focus on our greatest opportunities for positive social and environmental impact with our people, our communities, and our planet. We are committed to transparency and disclosure of our CSR strategies, programs, and governance. Progress along our CSR strategy is regularly reported to our senior management leadership team (“the Global Leadership Team”) and our Board of Directors, which also has oversight of our environmental, social, and governance strategy.
•Loving our People: We create opportunities for our Krispy Kremers to achieve their dreams — building the most engaged, inclusive workforce.
We are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout our organization, from our board room to our shops. We have established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (sponsored by members of the Global Leadership Team) and four U.S. Employee Resource Groups. We are focused on gender parity globally and increasing our U.S. people of color representation. We are also developing a comprehensive, global total rewards framework to drive pay equity and access for our Krispy Kremers.
•Loving our Communities: We bring joy to others — engaging locally to support and uplift communities globally.
Our brand purpose truly shines through our Acts of Joy and community fundraising initiatives. Whether through our “Beat the Pump” promotion where we aided our consumers by pegging the price of a dozen Original Glazed doughnuts to a gallon of gasoline, or through our offer of free doughnuts to graduating seniors, we bring joy to others while doing good. In fiscal 2022, we raised more than $36 million to support local community causes across America. We also engage with numerous local philanthropic organizations in the communities that we serve around the world.
•Loving our Planet: We respect our planet — using sustainable practices and reducing our environmental impacts.
We are committed to advancing sustainable business throughout our operations. During fiscal 2022, we progressed our efforts to address climate change and build the resilience of our business and supply chain. We have been conducting a multi-year global emissions assessment to establish our emissions baseline, using this foundation to soon set goals for greenhouse gas emission reductions, which will include Science Based Targets. 
We made progress on our responsible sourcing commitment across our global supply chain. Krispy Kreme has set a goal of using 100% cage-free eggs by 2026. During the year, we reached 45% of our goal while also outlining clear actions to meet this target. We are committed to using sustainable palm oil, with a goal to achieve 100% deforestation-free palm oil use by 2026. As global awareness of food waste increases, so does our focus on food waste reduction. We took steps in fiscal 2022 to increase landfill diversion and increase our use of food-to-feed initiatives across our business.
Team Members and Human Capital Resources 
Investing in, developing, and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. Globally, we employ approximately 23,500 employees as of January 1, 2023, including approximately 19,500 at Krispy Kreme locations that we refer to as our “Krispy Kremers.” We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement, although we have experienced occasional unionization initiatives.

We depend on our Krispy Kremers to provide great customer service, to make our products in adherence to our high-quality standards and to maintain the consistency of our operations and logistics chain. While we continue to operate in a competitive market for talent, we believe that our culture, policies, and practices contribute to our strong relationship with our Krispy Kremers, which we feel is instrumental to our business model. Our culture is best captured by our Leadership Mix, which are the dozen behaviors that guide us every day. The Leadership Mix was developed based on the beliefs of our founder, incorporating years of learning on what makes Krispy Kreme such a special organization. These cultural behaviors are shared with Krispy Kremers globally, through an internally developed Leadership Mix training program. 
The Leadership Mix is what keeps our consumers at the center of everything we do and ensures that our Krispy Kremers are empowered to do the right thing for our consumers and for the business. We pride ourselves on being an entrepreneurial and innovative team that is not afraid to take smart risks in service of creating awesome doughnut experiences. 
Consistent with our Leadership Mix ingredients, we pride ourselves on attracting a diverse team of Krispy Kremers and Insomniac team members from a wide range of backgrounds. As of January 1, 2023, our U.S. Krispy Kreme Company-owned operations include approximately 11,500 employees, of which 97% are field-based employees and the remaining 3% are corporate employees. 67% of such employees are people of color and 54% of such employees are female. We believe our diverse team drives the entrepreneurial culture that is at the center of our success. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our Krispy Kremers. Accordingly, we are committed to their health, safety, and wellness. 
Our Total Rewards platform provides Krispy Kremers and their families with access to a variety of competitive, innovative, flexible, and convenient pay, health, and wellness programs. Our total package of pay and benefits is designed to support the physical, mental, and financial health of our people and includes medical, dental, vision, EAP, life insurance and retirement benefits as well as disability benefits and assistance with major life activities, such as educational reimbursement and adoption. Many of these benefits are available to our part-time Krispy Kremers; we believe that offering select benefits to our part-time Krispy Kremers offers us a competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining talent. We have also rolled out employee equity ownership plans across the organization, including for our shop general managers, to effectively align Krispy Kremers’ incentives with the Company’s long-term strategic goals.
Marketing and Innovation 
Our marketing strategy is as unique and innovative as our brand. Krispy Kreme’s marketing strategy is to participate in culture through “Acts of Joy,” deliver new product experiences that align with seasonal and trending consumer and societal interests and to create positive connections through simple, frequent, brand-focused offerings that encourage shared experiences. The tactics which support this strategy are also distinct. In the U.S., Krispy Kreme’s paid media strategy is 100% digital with a heavy focus on social media where our passionate consumer base engages and shares our marketing programs far and wide through their own networks. Earned media is also an important part of our media mix. We create promotions and products that 
Table of Contents

attract media outlets to our brand. Through the widespread dissemination of our programs through pop culture, entertainment, and news outlets, we believe we can achieve disproportionately large attention relative to our spend in a media environment populated by brands with far larger media budgets. We believe our marketing strategy, supported with non-traditional media tactics, has proven to be a potent combination that simultaneously drives sales while growing brand love.
By drawing inspiration from important societal events, we create a unique way for our consumers to celebrate and engage. For example, in 2022 our “Beat the Pump” promotion created social “buzz” and significant consumer traffic for our Doughnut Shops. Our ability to create this connection between our consumers and our brand is what has helped make the Krispy Kreme brand iconic, and helps to solidify our position in popular culture. 
Limited time seasonal innovation and permanent innovations are used to create consumer wonder and are an essential ingredient in keeping our consumers engaged with the brand and the products. Our limited time offerings are anticipated by consumers and the media alike and generate significant social sharing amongst our fans and media coverage. The impact of limited time seasonal offerings goes well beyond the sales of the innovations themselves; they drive traffic and create additional sales of our core product offering.
Krispy Kreme has a strong brand presence across both emerging and well-established social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Tik-Tok, and Pinterest. These channels enable us to engage with our consumers on a personal level, while spreading the global brand of Krispy Kreme, including communicating promotional activity, featured products, new shop openings, and highlighting core equities of the brand. Social media allows precise geo-targeting around our shops and effective targeting of consumers likely to be interested in our messages.
Supply Chain 
Sourcing and Supplies 
We are committed to sourcing the best ingredients available for our products. The principal ingredients to manufacture our products include flour, shortening, and sugar which are used to formulate our proprietary doughnut mix and concentrate at our Winston-Salem manufacturing facility. We procure the raw materials for these products from different vendors. Although most raw materials we require are typically readily available from multiple vendors, we currently have approximately 20 main vendors in addition to our own mix plant. 
We manufacture our doughnut mix at our mix plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and a third-party facility in Pico Rivera, California, domestically, and at several locations internationally, where we produce the doughnut mix used to make our doughnuts across the U.S. and internationally. In support of international markets, we produce a concentrate exclusively at our Winston-Salem facility for shipping efficiency. The concentrate is mixed with commodity ingredients in local markets to get to a finished doughnut mix. Throughout the process, the recipe for what makes a Krispy Kreme doughnut remains known only to the Company. 
At an additional facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, we manufacture our proprietary doughnut making equipment for shipment to new shops and Doughnut Factories around the world. We manufacture a range of doughnut making lines, with different capacities to support the needs of different shop types. 
In addition, we provide other ingredients, packaging and supplies, principally to Company-owned and domestic franchise shops. Our Krispy Kreme shop-level replenishments generally occur on a weekly basis, working with two national distribution partners. In addition, we serve New York City with a regional distribution partner to best serve our needs in that market. 
In the U.S., we operate four Doughnut Factories located in Indianapolis, Indiana, Monroe, Ohio, New York, New York, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Internationally, we operate 38 Doughnut Factories, of which 24 are operated by franchisees. Each Doughnut Factory is staffed by Krispy Kremers and supports multiple business channels for Krispy Kreme. Each Doughnut Factory manufactures daily, powering the Hub and Spoke model by producing product for Spoke locations such as Fresh Shops and Carts and Food Trucks. In addition, they also provide DFD finished products to support local and regional markets. We operate DFD routes out of each Doughnut Factory to ensure our DFD doughnuts are delivered fresh, every day, and maintain our highest standards of quality and brand experience. 
We utilize our Concord, North Carolina production facility to manufacture our Branded Sweet Treat Line products, including a variety of Doughnut Bites and Mini Crullers, which are shelf stable and cake-based products. In addition, at the end of fiscal 2022, we began to transition manufacturing capacity of Branded Sweet Treat Line products to our mix plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (after exiting the co-manufacturer production facility located in Burlington, Iowa). After manufacturing, 
Table of Contents

packaging, and palletizing our Branded Sweet Treat Line products, we transport the products to a third-party warehousing and distribution vendor. This vendor warehouses, consolidates, and provides direct shipments to our retail partners’ supply networks. 
Insomnia Cookies operates a nationwide, efficient supply chain. To support the Insomnia Cookies shops, third-party logistic providers bring ingredients and supplies to their bakeries to create their warm, delicious products.
Quality Control 
We operate an integrated supply chain to help maintain the consistency and quality of products. Our business model is centered on ensuring consistent quality of our products. We manufacture doughnut mixes at our facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Additionally, we also manufacture doughnut mix concentrates, which are blended with flour and other ingredients by contract mix manufacturers to produce finished doughnut mix. We have an agreement with an independent food company to manufacture certain doughnut mixes using concentrate for domestic regions outside the southeastern U.S. and to provide backup mix production capability in the event of a business disruption at the Winston-Salem facility. In-process quality checks are performed throughout the production process, including ingredients, moisture percentage, fat percentage, sieve size, and metal checks. We provide specific instructions to franchise partners for storing and cooking our products. All products are transported and stored at ambient temperature. 
Competition 
We compete in the fragmented indulgence industry. Our domestic and international competitors include a wide range of retailers of doughnuts and other treats, coffee shops, and other café and bakery concepts. We also compete with snacks sold through convenience stores, supermarkets, restaurants and retail stores in the U.S. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region and by category. We also compete against retailers who sell sweet treats such as cookies, cupcakes, and ice cream shops. We compete on elements such as food quality, freshness, convenience, accessibility, customer service, price, and value. We view our brand engagement, overall consumer experience and the uniqueness of our Original Glazed doughnut as important factors that distinguish our brand from competitors, both in the doughnut and broader indulgence categories. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Executing Our Business Strategy – Our success depends on our ability to compete with many food service businesses.” 
Intellectual Property 
Our doughnut shops are operated under the Krispy Kreme® trademark, and we use many federally and internationally registered trademarks and service marks, including Original Glazed®, Hot Krispy Kreme Original Glazed Now®, Insomnia Cookies® and the logos associated with these marks. We have registered various trademarks in over 65 other countries, and we generally license the use of these trademarks to our franchisees for the operation of their doughnut shops. We have also licensed our marks for other consumer goods. We believe that our trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to our brand. To better protect our brand, we have registered and maintain numerous Internet domain names. 
Despite our efforts to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that these protections will be available in all cases, and our trademarks, service marks or other intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, declared generic, circumvented, infringed or otherwise violated. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may in the future be filed.
For more information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
Government Regulation 
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the U.S. and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. 
For more information on the risks associated with domestic and international regulation, see “Risk Factors — Risk Related to Regulation and Litigation.”

Seasonality 
Our sales peak at various times throughout the year due to certain promotional events and holiday celebrations. Additionally, our hot beverage sales generally increase during the fall and winter months while our iced beverage sales generally increase during the spring and summer months. Quarterly results also may be affected by the timing of the opening of new shops and the closing of existing shops. For these reasons, results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 
Research and Development 
New product innovation is important to the success of our business. We believe that the development of new Krispy Kreme doughnuts, beverages and other products attracts new consumers to our brand, increases shop sales, and allows our shops to strengthen daypart offerings. One of our properties in Winston-Salem, North Carolina includes research and development facilities including test kitchens and doughnut producing equipment used in developing new products and processes.
