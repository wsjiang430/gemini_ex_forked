We employ approximately 1,400 people, including temporary staff, of which fewer than 50 support our discontinued operations. In 2022, our net sales from continuing operations were $423.4 million (2021: $374.1 million, 2020: $324.8 million), and our net income from continuing operations was $32.0 million (2021: $30.0 million, 2020: $20.8 million).
Luxfer operates in two business segments - Elektron and Gas Cylinders.
Elektron Segment
Our Elektron Segment focuses on specialty materials based primarily on magnesium and zirconium. In 2022, sales from our Elektron Segment represented approximately 57% (2021: 52%, 2020: 56%) of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. Our top ten customers represented 40% of segment sales. No singular customer represented 10% or more of our Elektron Segment sales.
Key product lines include: 
•Advanced lightweight, corrosion-resistant and heat- and flame-resistant magnesium alloys for use in aerospace, healthcare and oil and gas applications.
•Magnesium powders used in countermeasure flares that protect aircraft from heat-seeking missiles and also for heating pads for self-heating meals used by the military and emergency-relief agencies.
•High-performance zirconium-based materials and oxides used as catalysts and in the manufacture of advanced ceramics, fiber-optic fuel cells, pharmaceuticals and many other performance products. 
•Magnesium, copper, and zinc photo-engraving plates for graphic arts and luxury packaging. 
Gas Cylinders Segment
Our Gas Cylinders Segment manufactures and markets specialized, highly-engineered cylinders using carbon composites and aluminum alloys. In 2022, sales from our Gas Cylinders Segment represented approximately 43% (2021: 48%, 2020: 44%) of our consolidated net sales. Our top ten customers represented 53.9% of segment sales. Two customers represented 12% of our Gas Cylinders Segment sales. No other singular customer represented greater than 10% of Gas Cylinders Segment sales.
Key product lines include:
•Carbon fiber composite cylinders for self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), used by firefighters and other emergency-responders. Our products are also used by scuba divers and personnel in potentially hazardous environments, such as mines.
•Carbon fiber composite cylinders for compressed natural gas (CNG) and hydrogen containment in alternative fuel (AF) vehicles. 
•Cylinders used for the containment of oxygen and other medical gases used by patients, healthcare facilities and laboratories.
Our U.S. aluminum gas cylinder business was sold in March 2021, our Superform U.K. business was sold in September 2021, and we expect our Superform U.S. business to be sold within the next twelve months. As a result, only our Superform U.S. business remains on the balance sheet as held-for-sale at December 31, 2022. Results from the three operations were disclosed as discontinued in the income statement for the corresponding years' of ownership.
All information included within this section relates to continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
See Note 17 ("Segment Information") to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our operating segments and our geographic areas.
Suppliers and raw materials
Update on global macro environment and related impact on supply chain disruption.
Demand from most end-markets we serve has continued to improve following the adverse impact of COVID-19 on volumes. This recovery in demand across the global macro environment following the onset of COVID-19 has resulted in supply chain challenges characterized by significant increases in cost of key inputs, including magnesium, aluminum, carbon fiber and energy, material and labor availability issues and transport cost increases. Additionally, during 2022 two critical suppliers for our Elektron Segment of magnesium and zirconium, respectively, had enforced force majeure, a standard clause in contracts to remove liability for unexpected and unavoidable catastrophes that interrupt the normal course of business and prevent participants from fulfilling contractual obligations. The force majeure for magnesium was declared in 2021 and remains in place, impacting our U.S. domestic procurement of this key material. The continuing conflict in Ukraine, which has resulted in punitive sanctions against the Russian Federation, has further exacerbated the availability and price of certain raw materials and energy supplies. 
In response to these supply chain disruptions, we have secured alternative sources of supply for key material inputs affected by force majeure and have built additional raw material inventory throughout the year. Furthermore, in the majority of cases, we are able to pass through raw material inflation to our customers. Currently, we expect the impact of material availability and inflation, as well as energy cost inflation and labor and transport constraints to continue through 2023. We also expect to be able to source sufficient material to meet demand and in the majority of cases, we expect to be able to pass on cost increases to our customers. However, the outlook remains uncertain with both the size and timing of future cost increases difficult to predict.
Impact of conflict in Ukraine
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing military conflict which commenced on February 24, 2022, has resulted in displacement of the Ukrainian population and disruption to the Ukrainian economy. Wide ranging sanctions have been imposed on the Russian Federation by the international community, targeting individuals, banks, businesses, funds transfers and imports and exports and are expected to have a significant adverse impact on Russia's economy as well as on international businesses active in the region. Currently, we do not expect the impact on Luxfer from these developments to be significant. We hold no direct operations in the region, and our sales to Russia and Ukraine combined represent less than one percent of total revenue by destination. Furthermore, neither country is a critical supplier of our raw materials. While Russia is a major global exporter of magnesium, we are able to source the metal from various alternative locations, including China, Israel and Turkey. Historically, we also sourced magnesium domestically, however, due to the force majeure declared by U.S. Magnesium LLC, the only U.S. producer of magnesium, in 2021, we currently cannot source from the U.S.
Elektron Segment
Key raw materials used by our Elektron Segment are magnesium, zircon sand and rare earths.
The world demand for magnesium is around one million metric tons per year. China provides about 80% of the world supply. Production outside of China, however, is significant, including, Dead Sea Magnesium in Israel, RIMA Industrial in Brazil, and smaller producers in Turkey and Russia. We purchase approximately 40% of our magnesium needs from China. We historically used only U.S.-sourced materials for our products sold to the U.S. military, for which U.S. sourcing is mandatory. However, given the current force majeure declared by our U.S. supplier of magnesium, we are in the process of qualifying non-U.S.-sourced material for sale to the U.S. military.
We generally purchase raw materials from suppliers on a spot basis under previously contracted terms and conditions. We have long-term supply contracts in place with U.S. Magnesium for raw material purchases of magnesium ingot for both military and commercial applications. The military contract covers magnesium purchases through December 31, 2023, whereas the commercial contract covers purchases through December 
31, 2023. However, given the current force majeure declared by U.S. Magnesium LLC, we do not know when or if we will be able to recommence the magnesium ingot purchases specified under this contract.
We purchase and process zircon sand, which is found in heavy-minerals sand, titanium dioxide and other products. Global production of zircon sand is estimated at approximately 1.5 million metric tons. We source premium-grade zircon sand from suppliers in South Africa, Senegal, Indonesia and Australia. We also purchase intermediate zirconium chemicals from suppliers in China. The level of these purchases is based on a number of factors, including required properties and relative market prices. During part of 2022, one of our suppliers of zircon sand had enforced force majeure.
There are 17 rare earth metals that are commonly found in nature. Usually mixed together with other mineral deposits, these rare earths exhibit magnetic and light-emitting properties that make them invaluable to high-technology manufacturers. These rare earth metals are used as ingredients in our zirconium chemical and magnesium alloy products. Our largest rare earth requirement is cerium, which we use in automotive catalysis compounds because of its unique oxygen-storage capabilities.
Gas Cylinders Segment
Key raw materials used in the Gas Cylinders Segment include high-strength carbon fiber and aluminum. Our main carbon fiber suppliers are Toray and Mitsubishi. In recent years, the carbon fiber has experienced periods of tight supply conditions due to increased demand for commercial aerospace, military and clean energy applications. Over time, we have built relationships with our suppliers, providing them predictable requirements and annual contracts that help to ensure procurement of our required volume of carbon fiber.
In 2022, we purchased approximately 40% of our aluminum from Rio Tinto Alcan and its associated companies. Aluminum represented approximately 35% of Gas Cylinders Segment's raw material costs in 2022. The price of aluminum, and carbon fiber, has been volatile in the past and has increased substantially in 2022. While we generally have passed through changes in input costs to our customers, some of our Gas Cylinders Segment contracts contain look-back provisions that result in a lag to our ability to adjust pricing for changes in input costs.

Seasonality
Historically, we have shutdown periods at most of our manufacturing sites, during which we carry out maintenance work. Shutdowns typically last two weeks in the summer and one to two weeks around the year-end holidays, resulting in reduced levels of activity in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Third quarter and fourth quarter sales and operating profit can be affected by our own manufacturing site shutdowns and by shutdowns of various industrial customers. We also operate in various geographic areas that are susceptible to bad weather during winter months, such as Calgary, Canada, and various U.S. eastern states. Bad weather can unexpectedly disrupt production and shipments from our manufacturing facilities, which can lead to reduced revenue and operating profit. Additionally, we manufacture products that are used in graphic arts and premium packaging, seasonal demand for which increases ahead of the year-end holidays.
