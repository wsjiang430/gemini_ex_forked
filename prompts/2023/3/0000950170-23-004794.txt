ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership in 2011 primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of motor fuel and the ownership and leasing of real estate used in the retail distribution of motor fuel. We also generate revenues from the operation of company operated retail sites.
 The Topper Group controls the sole member of our General Partner and has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board and to control and manage the operations and activities of the Partnership. As of February 23, 2023, the Topper Group also has beneficial ownership of a 38.5% limited partner interest in the Partnership.
Our principal executive office address is 645 Hamilton Street, Suite 400, Allentown, PA 18101, and our telephone number is (610) 625-8000. Our common units trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “CAPL.”
 We conduct our business through two operating segments – wholesale and retail. As of December 31, 2022, we distributed motor fuel on a wholesale basis to approximately 1,750 sites located in 34 states. We own or lease approximately 1,150 sites, of which we operate 255 as company operated sites. See "Item 7—Recent Developments—Change in Segment Reporting" for information regarding a change in our segment reporting.
 We are one of the ten largest independent distributors by motor fuel volume in the United States for ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, and we also distribute Sunoco, Valero, Gulf, Citgo, Marathon and Phillips 66-branded motor fuels (approximately 92% of the motor fuel we distributed during 2022 was branded). For approximately 61% of gallons sold, we receive a per gallon rate equal to the posted rack price, less any applicable discounts, plus transportation costs, taxes and a fixed rate per gallon of motor fuel. The remaining gallons are either retail sales or wholesale DTW contracts that provide for variable, market-based pricing.
 Regarding our supplier relationships, a material amount of our total gallons of motor fuel purchased are subject to Terms Discounts for prompt payment and other rebates and incentives, which are recorded within cost of sales. Prompt payment discounts are based on a percentage of the purchase price of motor fuel. As such, the dollar value of these discounts increases and decreases corresponding with motor fuel prices. Therefore, in periods of lower wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is negatively affected, and, in periods of higher wholesale motor fuel prices, our gross profit is positively affected (as it relates to these discounts). Based on our current volumes, we estimate a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would impact our overall annual wholesale motor fuel gross profit by approximately $2.8 million related to these payment discounts.
 The following table highlights the aggregate volume of motor fuel distributed to each of our principal customer groups (in millions). See Item 7—Results of Operations for additional information on the drivers of the fluctuations in the volume and site counts below.

We own approximately 60% of our properties that we lease to our dealers or utilize in our retail business. Our lease agreements with third-party landlords have an average remaining lease term of 5.0 years as of December 31, 2022.

Operations
 Wholesale Segment
 Our wholesale segment generated 2022 revenues of $2.7 billion and operating income of $94 million. The wholesale segment includes the wholesale distribution of motor fuel to lessee dealers and independent dealers. We have exclusive motor fuel distribution contracts with lessee dealers who lease the property from us. We also have exclusive distribution contracts with independent dealers to distribute motor fuel but do not collect rent from the independent dealers. Below is a description of the wholesale segment's principal customer groups.
Independent Dealer
 
•The independent dealer owns or leases the property and owns all motor fuel and convenience store inventory.
 •We contract to exclusively distribute motor fuel to the independent dealer at rack-plus pricing or, in some cases, DTW.
 •Under our distribution contracts, we agree to supply a particular branded motor fuel or unbranded motor fuel to a site or group of sites and arrange for all transportation.
 •Distribution contracts with independent dealers are typically seven to 15 years in length.

•As of December 31, 2022, the average remaining distribution contract term was 5.1 years.
 Lessee Dealer
 
•We own or lease the property and then lease or sublease the site to a dealer.
 •The lessee dealer owns all motor fuel and retail site inventory and sets its own pricing and gross profit margins.
 •We collect wholesale motor fuel margins at rack-plus pricing or, in some cases, DTW.
 •Under our distribution contracts, we agree to supply a particular branded motor fuel or unbranded motor fuel to a site or group of sites and arrange for all transportation.
 •Exclusive distribution contracts with dealers who lease property from us run concurrent in length to the retail site’s lease period (generally three to 10 years).
 •Leases are generally triple net leases.
 •As of December 31, 2022, the average remaining lease agreement term was 2.6 years.
 DMS
 Prior to April 14, 2020, we owned or leased property and then leased or subleased the site to DMS and distributed fuel to DMS. DMS owned the motor fuel and retail site inventory and set its own pricing and gross profit margin. Since the April 14, 2020 acquisition of retail and wholesale assets, we no longer sell fuel nor lease sites to DMS.
CST Fuel Supply
 In 2015, we purchased a 17.5% limited partner interest in CST Fuel Supply from CST. We received pro rata distributions from CST Fuel Supply related to CST Marketing and Supply’s distribution of motor fuel to the majority of CST’s legacy U.S. retail sites.
 Effective March 25, 2020, we divested our entire interest in CST Fuel Supply in the CST Fuel Supply Exchange.
 Retail Segment
 Our retail segment generated 2022 revenues of $2.3 billion and operating income of $107 million. The retail segment includes the sale of convenience merchandise items at company operated sites and the retail sale of motor fuel at company operated and commission sites. Below is a description of the retail segment's principal customer groups.
Company Operated Sites
 
•We own or lease the property, operate the retail site and retain all profits from motor fuel and retail site operations.
 •We own the merchandise inventory and retain the profits from the sale of convenience merchandise items.
 •We own the motor fuel inventory and set the motor fuel pricing.
 •We maintain inventory from the time of the purchase of motor fuel from third-party suppliers until the retail sale to the end customer. On average, we maintain approximately 5-days’ worth of motor fuel sales in inventory at each site.
 •LGW and CAPL JKM Wholesale distribute all of the motor fuel required by our company operated sites to LGWS and Joe’s Kwik Marts, respectively, which owns the motor fuel inventory and sells motor fuel to retail customers. LGW records qualifying wholesale motor fuel distribution gross income and LGWS and Joe’s Kwik Marts record the non-qualifying retail sale.
Commission Sites
 
•We own or lease the property and then lease or sublease the site to the commission agent, who pays rent to us and operates all the non-fuel related operations at the sites for its own account.
 •We own the motor fuel inventory, set the motor fuel pricing and generate revenue from the retail sale of motor fuels to the end customer.

•We pay the commission agent a commission for each gallon of motor fuel sold.
 •LGW distributes motor fuel on to LGWS, which owns the motor fuel inventory and sells motor fuel to retail customers. LGW records qualifying wholesale motor fuel distribution gross income and LGWS records the non-qualifying retail sale.
 •As of December 31, 2022, the average remaining motor fuel distribution and lease agreement term for our commission agents was 1.2 years.
 Business Strategy and Objective
 Our primary business objective is to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions while maintaining discipline with leverage. The amount of any distribution is subject to the discretion of the Board, and the Board may modify or revoke the cash distribution policy at any time. Our Partnership Agreement does not require us to pay any distributions.
 Our business strategy to achieve our objective of paying and, over time, increasing our quarterly cash distributions, is focused on the following key initiatives:
 
•Expand within and beyond our existing markets through acquisitions. Since our IPO and through February 23, 2023, we have completed acquisitions for a total of approximately 1,000 fee and leasehold sites and 700 wholesale fuel supply contracts for total consideration of approximately $1.5 billion;
 •Enhance our real estate business’ cash flows by owning or leasing sites in prime locations;
 •Increase cash flows from our wholesale segment by expanding market share and growing rental income over time;
 •Increase cash flows from our retail segment by operating our retail sites efficiently with a focus on providing excellent value and service;
 •Maintain strong relationships with major integrated oil companies and refiners; and
 •Optimize the operations of acquired assets to the most appropriate format (lessee dealer, independent dealer, retail site) to maximize our investment return.
 We believe our competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on our strategic opportunities, including:
 
•Stable cash flows from real estate rent income and wholesale motor fuel distribution;
 •Established history of acquiring sites and successfully integrating these sites and operations into our existing business;
 •Long-term relationships with major integrated oil companies and other key suppliers, which support our negotiations with and enable us to collaboratively work with our suppliers to maximize benefits to the Partnership; and
 •Prime real estate locations in areas with high traffic and considerable motor fuel consumption.
 Subsequent to an acquisition and throughout the life cycle of a site, we evaluate the optimal operation of each site as company operated, lessee dealer or commission, or we consider strategic alternatives, including divesting the site.
 Supplier Arrangements
 We distribute branded motor fuel under the Exxon, Mobil, BP, Shell, Sunoco, Valero, Gulf, Citgo, Marathon and Phillips 66 brands to our customers. Branded motor fuels are purchased from major integrated oil companies and refiners under supply agreements. For 2022, we purchased approximately 81% of our motor fuel from four suppliers. Certain suppliers offer volume rebates or incentive payments to drive volumes and provide an incentive for branding new locations. Certain suppliers require that all or a portion of any such incentive payments be repaid to the supplier in the event that the sites are rebranded within a stated number of years. We also purchase unbranded motor fuel for distribution. As of December 31, 2022, our supply agreements had a weighted-average remaining term of approximately 5.0 years.
Competition
 Our wholesale segment competes with other motor fuel distributors. Major competitive factors for us include, among others, customer service, price and quality of service and availability of products.
 The convenience store industry is highly competitive, fragmented and characterized by constant change in the number and type of retailers offering products and services of the type sold at our sites. We compete with other retail site chains, independently owned sites, motor fuel stations, supermarkets, drugstores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores and hypermarkets. Major competitive factors include, among others, location, ease of access, product and service selection, motor fuel brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, and cleanliness.
 Seasonality
 Our business exhibits substantial seasonality due to our wholesale and retail sites being located in certain geographic areas that are affected by seasonal weather and temperature trends and associated changes in retail customer activity during different seasons. Historically, sales volumes have been highest in the second and third quarters (during the summer activity months) and lowest during the winter months in the first and fourth quarters.
Trade Names, Service Marks and Trademarks
 We are a wholesale distributor of motor fuel for various major integrated oil companies and are licensed to market/resell motor fuel under their respective motor fuel brands. We are not aware of any facts that would negatively affect our continuing use of any trademarks, trade names or service marks.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to USTs, the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics, composition, storage and sale of motor fuel and the health and safety of our employees. We incorporate by reference into this section our disclosures included in Note 2 under the captions “Environmental Matters” and “Asset Retirement Obligations” as well as Note 10 under the caption “Asset Retirement Obligations” and Note 15 to the financial statements.
Other Regulatory Matters
 Our retail sites are subject to regulation by federal, state, and/or local agencies and to licensing and regulations by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of retail sites, including regulations relating to zoning and building requirements and the preparation and sale of food. Our retail sites are also subject to federal, state and/or local laws governing such matters as wage rates, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. At the federal, state and local levels, there are proposals under consideration from time to time to increase minimum wage rates and modify or restrict immigration policies.
Human Capital
 
The Partnership has no direct employees. As of December 31, 2022, 228 employees of the Topper Group provided management services to us under the Omnibus Agreement. In addition, 2,009 store employees of the Topper Group provided services at our company operated sites.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. As a customer-centric company with a strong service culture, we constantly work to maintain our position as an employer of choice. This requires a commitment to workplace inclusion and safety, as well as competitive total compensation that meets the needs of our employees. Our talent management and succession plan process includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors and a plan for talent development.
