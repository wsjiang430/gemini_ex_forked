In November 2022, Hillman's corporate headquarters moved from 10590 Hamilton Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio to 1280 Kemper Meadow Drive, Forest Park, Ohio. We maintain a website at www.hillmangroup.com. Information contained or linked on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report and should not be considered a part of this annual report.
History
In 1964, Max Hillman established Hillman Bolt & Screw Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio when he purchased a franchise operation from Sharon Bolt & Screw, a hardware fastener company. Max began distributing fasteners to independent hardware stores in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky, with a relentless commitment to service.
Max’s two sons, Mick Hillman and Rick Hillman, joined their father’s company in 1969, as Hillman’s customer base and distribution network continued to grow. In 1982, Hillman Bolt & Screw was purchased by Sun Distributors followed by Max’s retirement shortly thereafter. Mick and Rick took over the day-to-day operations of the business in 1984. 
During the early 1990s, the Company developed its National Field Service Group, which today includes 1,100 field service and sales representatives, to manage the complex assortment of Hillman products on its customers’ shelves. Over the next three decades Hillman continued to win new business, expanding from traditional hardware stores to big box and home improvement retailers, and into adjacent product categories through multiple strategic acquisitions. 
During the 2000s, Hillman was purchased three separate times by private equity firms (2001, 2004 and 2010). During 2012 and 2013, Rick and Mick Hillman retired, respectively, after more than 40 years of actively managing the Company. Thereafter in 2014, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired the majority interest in Hillman. In 2021, Hillman became a publicly traded company, listing its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol “HLMN” by virtue of a merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company ("SPAC"). See Note 3 - Merger Agreement of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Hillman’s legacy of service has remained unchanged throughout its history, and it continues to take care of its customers first. 
Nasdaq listing - 2021
During 2021, the Company began exploring ways to further expand is access to the capital markets by becoming a publicly-traded entity. On July 14, 2021, privately held HMAN Group Holdings Inc. ("Old Hillman"), and Landcadia Holdings III, Inc. (“Landcadia” and after the Business Combination described herein, “New Hillman”), a SPAC consummated the previously announced business combination (the “Closing”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 24, 2021 (as amended on March 12, 2021, the "Merger Agreement”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, the discussion of the Company and its financial condition and results of operations is with respect to New Hillman following the closing date and Old Hillman prior to the closing date. See Note 3 - Merger Agreement of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In connection with the Closing, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”), which provided for a new funded term loan facility of $835.0 million and a delayed draw term loan facility of $200.0 million (of which $16.0 million was drawn). The Company also entered into an amendment to their existing asset-based revolving credit agreement, extending the maturity and conformed certain provisions to the Term Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the funded term loans under the Term Credit Agreement and revolving credit loans under the ABL Credit Agreement were used, together with other available cash, to (1) refinance in full all outstanding term loans and to terminate all outstanding commitments under the credit agreement, dated as of May 31, 2018, (2) refinance outstanding revolving credit loans, and (3) redeem in full senior notes due July 15, 2022 (the “6.375% Senior Notes”). Additionally, we fully redeemed the 11.6% Junior Subordinated Debentures. In connection with the refinancing, we incurred a loss of $8.1 million and paid $38.7 million in financing fees, of which $21.0 million were recorded as a financing activity. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Hillman Group
We are comprised of three separate operating business segments: (1) Hardware and Protective Solutions, (2) Robotics and Digital Solutions, and (3) Canada.
We provide products such as fasteners and related hardware items; threaded rod and metal shapes; keys, key duplication systems, and accessories; builder's hardware; personal protective equipment, such as gloves and eye-wear; and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs to retail outlets, primarily hardware stores, home centers and mass merchants, pet supply stores, grocery stores, and drug stores.

| December 31, 2022 Form 10-K

We market and distribute a wide variety of Stock Keeping Units (“SKUs”) of small, hard-to-find and hard-to-manage hardware items. We function as a category manager for retailers and support these products with in-store service, high order fill rates, and rapid delivery of products sold. Sales and service representatives regularly visit retail outlets to review stock levels, reorder items in need of replacement, and interact with the store management to offer new product and merchandising ideas. Thousands of items can be actively managed with the retailer experiencing a substantial reduction of in-store labor costs and replenishment paperwork. Service representatives also assist in organizing the products in a consumer-friendly manner. We complement our broad range of products with merchandising services such as displays, product identification stickers, retail price labels, store rack and drawer systems, assistance in rack positioning and store layout, and inventory restocking services. We regularly refresh retailers' displays with new products and package designs utilizing color-coding to simplify the shopping experience for consumers and improve the attractiveness of individual store displays.
We operate from 22 strategically located distribution centers in North America and supplement our operations with third-party logistics providers to warehouse and ship customer orders in the certain areas.
Products and Suppliers
Our product strategy concentrates on providing total project solutions using the latest technology for common and unique home improvement projects. Our portfolio provides retailers the assurance that their shoppers can find the right product at the right price within an 'easy to shop' environment.
We currently manage a worldwide supply chain comprised of a large number of vendors, the largest of which accounted for approximately 4.9% of the Company's annual purchases and the top five of which accounted for approximately 15.5% of our annual purchases. Our vendor quality control procedures include on-site evaluations and frequent product testing. Vendors are also evaluated based on delivery performance and the accuracy of their shipments.
Hardware and Protective Solutions
Our Hardware and Protective Solutions segment includes a variety of product categories including: Fasteners; Builders Hardware; Wall Hanging, Threaded Rod and Metal Shapes; Letters, Numbers, and Signs ("LNS"); and Personal Protection Equipment. 
Our Fastener business consists of three categories: core fasteners, construction fasteners, and anchors sold under a variety of brands including Hillman, Fas-n-Tite, Deck-Plus, and Power-Pro. Core fasteners include nuts, bolts, screws, washers, and specialty items. Construction fasteners include deck, drywall, metal screws, and both hand driven and collated nails. Anchors include hollow wall and solid wall items such as plastic anchors, toggle bolts, concrete screws, and wedge anchors. 
Builders Hardware includes a variety of common household items such as coat hooks, door stops, hinges, gate latches, and decorative hardware. We market the builder's hardware products under the Hardware Essentials® brand and provide the retailer with innovation in both product and merchandising solutions. The Hardware Essentials® program utilizes modular packaging, color coding, and integrated merchandising to simplify the shopping experience for consumers. Colorful signs, packaging, and installation instructions guide the consumer quickly and easily to the correct product location in store, while digital content including pictures and videos assist the online journey. Hardware Essentials® provides retailers and consumers decorative upgrade opportunities through contemporary finishes and designs.
The Wall Hanging category includes traditional picture hanging hardware, primarily marketed under the OOK® and Hillman brands, and the High & Mighty® series of tool-free wall hangers, decorative hooks and floating shelves that was launched in 2017.
We are the leading supplier of Threaded Rod and Metal Shapes in the retail market. The SteelWorks® threaded rod product includes hot and cold rolled rod, both weldable and plated, as well as a complete offering of All-Thread rod in galvanized steel, stainless steel, and brass. The SteelWorks® program is carried by many top retailers, including Lowe's and Menard's, and through cooperatives such as Ace Hardware. In addition, we are the primary supplier of Metal Shapes to many wholesalers throughout the country.
LNS includes product lines that target both the homeowner and commercial user. Product lines within this category include individual and/or packaged letters, numbers, signs, safety related products (e.g. 911 signs), driveway markers, and a variety of sign accessories, such as sign frames.
Our expansive Personal Protective Equipment category covers many uses for DIYer ("Do It Yourself") around the house and for the professional at the job site. Our products can be found at leading retailers across North America.

Robotics and Digital Solutions 
Our Robotics and Digital Solutions segment consists primarily of software-enabled robotic key duplication and engraving solutions that are tailored to the unique needs of the consumer. Robotics and Digital Solutions products are located in high-traffic environments where retailers can provide consumers with on-the-spot, customized licensed and unlicensed key and engraving options. Our offerings include store associated assisted and self-service robotic engraving and key duplication kiosks; together with related software, systems, keys, and key accessories sold in proximity to the kiosks. Our services include product and category management, merchandising services, and access to our proprietary robotic key duplicating and engraving software platforms and equipment.
We design and manufacture proprietary software and equipment in our Boulder, Colorado and Tempe, Arizona facilities; housing the cornerstone for our key duplication business. Our key duplication system is offered in various retail channels including mass merchants, home centers, automotive parts retailers, franchise and independent hardware stores, and grocery/drug chains. We believe we provide the most diverse key duplication systems in the industry, through our unique combination of self-service kiosk technology and store associate assisted duplication systems. Equipment diversity allows us to meet the individual needs of retailers. Our self-service solutions are driven by our MinuteKey technology, while store associate assisted duplication currently uses the state-of-the-art KeyKrafter® equipment and other legacy duplication machines. 
In 2018, we completed the acquisition of MinuteKey, the world’s first self-service robotic key duplication machine. The accuracy of robotics technology put to work in an innovative way makes MinuteKey machines easy to use, convenient, fast and highly reliable. We utilize a proprietary network integration software within our MinuteKey kiosks to maintain high levels of machine up-time and ensure machines have the optimal mix of key types available for duplication. The kiosk is completely self-service and has a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. We manufacture and support the MinuteKey kiosk out of our Boulder, Colorado and Tempe, Arizona facilities.
Hillman KeyKrafter® is our most popular, innovative, and effective store associate assisted key duplication kiosk. It provides significant reduction in duplication time while increasing accuracy and ease of use for unskilled store associates. Additionally, with the KeyKrafter® solution, the capability exists for consumers to securely store and retrieve digital back-ups of their key without the original through the revolutionary Hillman KeyHero® Technology. Our Precision Laser Key System™ uses a digital optical camera, lasers, and proprietary software to scan a customer’s key. The system identifies the key and retrieves the key’s specifications, including the appropriate blank and cutting pattern, from a comprehensive database. This technology automates nearly every aspect of key duplication and provides the ability for every store associate to cut a key accurately. In the automotive key space, we offer the SmartBox Automotive Key Programmer which is a tool to quickly and easily pair transponder keys, remotes, and smart keys.
We retain ownership of the key duplicating equipment and market and sell keys and key accessories. Our proprietary key offering features the universal blank which uses a “universal” keyway to replace up to five original equipment keys. We continually refresh the retailer’s key offerings by introducing decorated and licensed keys and accessories. Our key offering features decorative themes of art and popular licenses such as NFL, Disney, Breast Cancer Awareness, and Marvel to increase personalization, purchase frequency and average transaction value per key. We also market a successful line of decorative and licensed lanyards and other key accessories.
All of our key duplication systems are supported by a dedicated in store kiosk sales and service team.
In our engraving business, we supply a variety of innovative options of consumer-operated robotic kiosks such as Quick-Tag®, TagWorks®, and FIDO® for engraving specialty items such as pet identification tags, luggage tags, and other engraved identification tags. We have developed unique engraving systems leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to provide a customized solution for mass merchant, pet supply retailers, and other high traffic areas such as theme parks, all supported by our in store kiosk field service technicians. We design, engineer, manufacture, and assemble the engraving kiosks in our Boulder, Colorado and Tempe, Arizona facilities.
Our engraving business focuses on the growing consumer spending trends surrounding personalized and pet identification. Innovation has played a major role in the development of our engraving business unit. From the 

| December 31, 2022 Form 10-K

original Quick-Tag® consumer-operated kiosk system to the proprietary laser system of TagWorks®, we continue to lead the industry with consumer-friendly engraving solutions. As in our key business, we retain ownership of the key engraving equipment and market and sell blank tags.
Robotics and Digital Solutions generated approximately $249.9 million, $249.5 million, and $209.3 million of revenues in the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively. 
Canada
Our Canada segment distributes fasteners and related hardware items, threaded rod, keys, key duplicating systems, accessories, and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs to hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants, industrial distributors, automotive aftermarket distributors, and other retail outlets and industrial Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) in Canada. The product lines offered in our Canada segment are consistent with the product offerings detailed in our other segments. The Canada segment also produces made to order screws and self-locking fasteners for automotive suppliers, OEMs, and industrial distributors.
Our Canada segment generated approximately $159.6 million, $151.5 million and $134.6 million of revenues in the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, respectively. 
Markets and Customers
We sell our products to national accounts such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menard’s, PETCO, PetSmart, Tractor Supply, and Walmart. Our status as a national supplier of proprietary products to big box retailers allows us to develop a strong market position and high barriers to entry within our product categories.
We service a wide variety of franchise and independent retail outlets. These individual dealers are typically members of the larger cooperatives, such as Ace Hardware, True Value, and Do-It-Best. We ship directly to the cooperative's retail locations and also supply many items to the cooperative's central warehouses. These central warehouses distribute to their members that do not have a requirement for Hillman's in-store service. These arrangements reduce credit risk and logistic expenses for us while also reducing central warehouse inventory and delivery costs for the cooperatives.
A typical hardware store maintains thousands of different items in inventory, many of which generate small dollar sales but large profits. It is difficult for a retailer to economically monitor all stock levels and to reorder the products from multiple vendors. This problem is compounded by the necessity of receiving small shipments of inventory at different times and stocking the goods. The failure to have these small items available will have an adverse effect on store traffic, thereby possibly denying the retailer the opportunity to sell items that generate higher dollar profits.
We sell our products to a large volume of customers, the top two of which accounted for approximately $678.7 million, or approximately 46% of our total revenues in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Home Depot was the single largest customer, representing approximately $356.8 million or 24.0% of our total revenues. Lowe's was the second largest at approximately $321.9 million or 21.7%. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in 2022. In each of the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020, we derived over 10% of our total revenues from Lowe's and Home Depot which operated in each of our operating segments. See Note 20 - Concentration of Credit Risks of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Hillman continues to expand its B2B eCommerce platform allowing certain customers to order online through the Company’s website, www.hillmangroup.com. The B2B eCommerce platform features many of our items available for sale online and over thousands of customers are enrolled with the online ordering platform. We continue to support direct-to-store and direct-to-consumer fulfillment for consumers who choose to order fasteners directly from retailers' websites. 
Sales and Marketing
We believe that our primary competitive advantage is rooted in our ability to provide a greater level of customer service than our competitors. We partner with our customers to understand the unmet needs of consumers, design creative solutions, and commercialize those solutions, bringing them to life in both physical and digital channels through a tight alignment between the product management, marketing communications, and channel marketing functions. We provide best in class support and customer service at every touch point for our retail partners. Service is the hallmark of Hillman company-wide, employing 1,101 full-time and 122 part-time people on our sales and service team. The national accounts field service organization consists of approximately 745 employees and 72 field managers focusing on big box retailers, pet super stores, large national discount chains, and grocery stores. This organization reorders products, details store shelves, and sets up in-store promotions. Many of our largest customers use Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) for processing of orders and invoices.

| December 31, 2022 Form 10-K

We employ what we believe to be the largest direct sales force in the industry. The sales force, which consists of approximately 255 employees and is managed by 29 field managers, focuses on the franchise and independent customers. The depth of the sales and service team enables us to maintain consistent call cycles ensuring that all customers experience proper stock levels and inventory turns. This team also prepares custom plan-o-grams of displays to fit the needs of any store and establishes programs that meet customers' requirements for pricing, invoicing, and other needs. This group also benefits from daily internal support from our inside sales and customer service teams. On average, each sales representative is responsible for approximately 60 full service accounts that the sales representative calls on approximately every two weeks. These efforts allow the sales force to sell and support our product lines.
Competition
Our primary competitors in the national accounts marketplace for fasteners are Primesource Building Products, Inc., Midwest Fastener Corporation, Illinois Tool Works Inc., Spectrum Brands, and competition from direct import by our customers. Our national competitors for gloves and personal protective equipment include Techtronic Industries, West Chester Protective Gear, PIP, Iron Clad, and MidWest Quality Gloves, Inc. Competition is primarily based on sourcing and price. We believe our product innovation and in store merchandising service create a more compelling and unique experience for both the consumer and our customers. Other competitors are local and regional distributors. Competitors in the pet tag market are specialty retailers, direct mail order, and retailers with in-store mail order capability. The Quick-Tag®, FIDO®, and TagWorks® systems have patent protected technology that is a major barrier to entry and helps to preserve this market segment. 
The principal competitor for our franchise and independent business is Midwest Fastener in the hardware store marketplace. The hardware outlets that purchase our products without regularly scheduled sales representative visits may also purchase products from local and regional distributors and cooperatives. We compete primarily on field service, merchandising, as well as product availability and price, and depth of product line.
Insurance Arrangements
Under our current insurance programs, commercial umbrella coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposure and aggregate losses in excess of expected claims. We retain the exposure on certain expected losses related to workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile claims. We also retain the exposure on expected losses related to health benefits of certain employees. We believe that our present insurance is adequate for our businesses. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Human Capital Resources
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,773 full time and part time employees, none of which were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In our opinion, employee relations are good.
Health and Safety
Employee health and safety is a top priority in all aspects of our business. We are committed to providing a healthy environment and safe workplace at all of our facilities and in the field. We maintain a safety compliance program. We regularly conduct self-assessments to examine our safety culture and processes. In addition, we have invested in our safety team to provide oversight and ensure robust safety protocols are present across all of our operations.
Attraction, Development, and Retention
The success of our efforts to grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives, our sales force, and other personnel. Our Human Resources department leads the search to reach a diverse talent pool. We have a standard framework for posting jobs, interviewing for open positions, and onboarding new employees. We offer employees resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diverse talent on our team. We seek people who are demonstrate our core values, absolute integrity, accountability to our team and customers, the ability to build on difference, trust and respect.
Diversity and Inclusion

| December 31, 2022 Form 10-K

We are committed to actions that build an inclusive and equitable workplace where diversity is valued and leveraged. We ask our employees to bring their authentic selves to work every day and this shows in both our products and our services. We are committed to creating equal opportunities for employment, and creating inclusive and diverse workplaces that allow our team to perform to their fullest potential. 
Backlog
We do not consider the sales backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance due to the short order cycle of our business. Our sales backlog from ongoing operations was approximately $24.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $34.0 million as of December 25, 2021. We expect to realize the entire December 31, 2022 backlog during fiscal 2023.
