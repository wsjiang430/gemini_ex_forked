B Comm is a provider of maintenance, repair, upgrade and installation services to the communications markets. The transaction directly aligns with the strategy to grow our MSA revenue base and expand our communication services within the utility markets.
​
Future Infrastructure Holdings, LLC. On January 15, 2021, we acquired Future Infrastructure Holdings, LLC (“FIH”) in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $604.7 million, net of cash acquired. FIH is a provider of non-discretionary maintenance, repair, upgrade, and installation services to the communications, regulated gas utility, and infrastructure markets. FIH furthers our strategic plan to expand our service lines, enter new markets, and grow our MSA revenue base. The transaction directly aligns with our strategy to grow in large, higher growth, higher margin markets, and expands our utility services capabilities.
​
Other acquisitions. In addition to these acquisitions, we have acquired other businesses as we continue to seek opportunities to deepen our market presence, broaden our geographic reach, and expand our service offerings. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates, especially those with strong management teams and growing end markets such as renewable energy, gas and electric utilities, and communications. 
​
Strategy
​
Our strategy has remained consistent from year to year and continues to emphasize the following key elements:
​

● | Growth Through Controlled Expansion. We continue to grow our Company by expanding our scope of services, leveraging our existing customer base to expand into new geographic markets, and adding new customers. In addition, we continue to evaluate acquisitions that offer growth opportunities and the ability to leverage our resources as a leading service provider to the energy, power, utility and communications industries. Our strategy also focuses on higher growth end markets such as renewable energy, utilities and communications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Emphasis on MSA Revenue Growth and Retention of Existing Customers. In order to fully leverage our relationships with our existing customer base, we believe it is important to maintain strong customer relationships in order to drive more revenue from them. We are also focused on expanding our base of services provided under MSAs, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide visible, recurring revenue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Ownership or Long-Term Leasing of Equipment. Many of our services are equipment intensive. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership or long-term leasing of a large and varied construction fleet and our maintenance facilities enhances our access to reliable equipment at a favorable cost.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Stable Work Force. Our business model emphasizes self-performance of a significant portion of our work. In each of our segments, we maintain a stable work force of skilled, experienced craft professionals, many of whom are cross-trained on projects such as pipeline and facility construction, refinery maintenance, gas and electrical distribution, and piping systems. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

5





● | Selective Bidding. We selectively bid projects that we believe offer an opportunity to meet our profitability objectives or that offer the opportunity to enter promising new markets. In addition, we review our bidding opportunities to attempt to minimize concentration of work with any one customer, in any one industry, or in stressed labor markets. We believe that by carefully positioning ourselves in market segments that have meaningful barriers of entry, we can continue to be competitive. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Maintain a strong balance sheet and a conservative capital structure. We have maintained a capital structure that provides access to debt financing as needed while relying on strong operating cash flows to provide the primary support for our operations. We believe this structure provides our customers, our lenders, and our bonding companies assurance of our financial capabilities. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide letter of credit capability and, if needed, to augment our liquidity needs.

Backlog
​
Backlog is discussed in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
​
Customers
​
We have longstanding customer relationships with utility, refining, petrochemical, communications, midstream, downstream, and engineering companies, as well as independent power producers and transportation agencies across our core markets. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, major electrical and gas projects for large utility companies in the United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenue in any given year.
​
We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from daily work orders to as long as 36 months, and occasionally longer, for completion on larger projects. We often provide services under long term Master Services Agreements (MSAs), which are generally multi-year agreements for specific types of work. Work performed under these contracts is typically generated through project specific work orders, ranging from repairs and new installations, to maintenance and upgrade services. These MSAs have various terms, depending on the nature of the services provided, and our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs, although we do have MSAs that include minimum spend requirements, or targeted spend amounts. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue derived from projects performed under MSAs was 45.8%, 45.9%, and 39.0%, respectively. 
​
Our customers have included the Texas Department of Transportation and Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development in the Southern United States as well as many of the leading energy and utility companies in the United States, including, among others, Enterprise Pipeline, Xcel Energy, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Gas, Oncor Electric, Duke Energy, Sempra Energy, Williams, NRG, Chevron, Kinder Morgan, Dominion, Valero, Enel Green Power North America, ExxonMobil and Phillips 66. 
​
Our top ten customers vary from year to year due to the nature of our business. A large construction project for a customer may result in significant revenue in one year, with significantly less revenue in subsequent years after project completion. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 46.1%, 42.9% and 47.0%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from our top ten customers in each year. In each of the years, a different group of customers comprised the top ten customers by revenue.
​
Management at each of our business units is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our segment and business unit management teams work with our business development group to foster existing customer relationships and better understand their needs in order to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. Segment and business unit managers are also responsible for working with our business development group in pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.
​

We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Some of our strategic relationships are in the form of long-term MSAs. However, we realize that future opportunities also require cost effective bids, as pricing is a key element for most construction projects and service agreements.
​
Seasonality, cyclicality and variability
​
Our results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, and named storms, which can impact our ability to perform construction and specialty services. These seasonal impacts can affect revenue and profitability in all of our businesses. Any quarter can be affected either negatively, or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects in our Utilities segment tends to be lower during the early part of the calendar year due to clients’ internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter.
​
Our project values range in size from several hundred dollars to several hundred million dollars. The bulk of our work is comprised of project sizes that average less than $3.0 million. We also perform construction projects which tend not to be seasonal but can fluctuate from year to year based on customer timing, project duration, weather, and general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines, or delays in new projects, or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical and seasonal nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of financial condition, or operating results for any other quarter, or for an entire year.
​
Competition
​
We face competition on large construction projects from both regional and national contractors, including competition from larger companies that have financial and other resources in excess of those available to us. Competitors on small construction projects range from a few large construction companies, to a variety of smaller contractors. We compete with many local and regional firms for construction services and with a number of large firms on select projects. Each business unit faces varied competition depending on the types of projects, project locations, and services offered.
​
We compete with different companies in different end markets. For example, competitors in our utilities markets include Quanta Services, Inc. and MasTec, Inc.; competitors in our industrial markets include PCL, Cajun Construction, and Boh Brothers; competitors in the renewables market include Blattner Energy and Mortenson; and competitors in our highway services markets include Sterling Construction Company and Zachry Construction Company. In each market we may also compete with local, private companies.
​
We believe that the primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation for quality, safety, schedule certainty, relevant experience, availability of field supervision and skilled labor, machinery and equipment, financial strength, as well as knowledge of local markets and conditions. We believe that we have the ability to compete favorably in all of these factors. 
​
Contract Provisions and Subcontracting
​
We typically structure contracts as unit-price, time and material, fixed-price or cost reimbursable plus fixed fee. A portion of our revenue is derived from MSAs, which provide a menu of available services that are utilized on an as-needed basis and are typically priced using a unit-price or on a time and material basis. The remainder of our services are generated from contracts for specific construction or installation projects, which are subject to multiple pricing options, including unit-price, time and material, fixed-price, or cost reimbursable plus fixed fee. Under a fixed-price contract, we provide labor, equipment and services required by a project for a competitively bid or negotiated fixed price. Under a unit-price contract, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a project at a fixed price per unit of work. While the unit-price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer, any increase in our unit cost over the unit price bid, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, faulty estimates or other factors, is borne by us. Significant materials required under a fixed-price or unit-price contract, such as pipe, turbines, boilers and vessels, are typically supplied by the customer.
​

Substantially all of our gas and electric distribution services are provided pursuant to renewable MSAs on a “unit-price” basis. Fees on unit-price contracts are negotiated and earned based on units completed. Historically, substantially all of the gas and electric distribution customers have renewed their MSAs with us. Facility maintenance services, such as regularly scheduled and emergency repair work, are provided on an ongoing basis at predetermined rates, or on a time and material basis.
​
Construction contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding or through negotiations with customers. We are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by customers who maintain pre-qualified contractor lists. Contractors are selected for the pre-approved contractor lists by virtue of their prior performance for such customers, as well as their experience, reputation for quality, safety record, financial strength, competitiveness, and bonding capacity.
​
In evaluating bid opportunities, we consider such factors as the customer, the geographic location of the work, the availability of labor, our competitive advantage or disadvantage relative to other likely bidders, our current and projected workload, the likelihood of additional work, our history with the client, contract terms, and the project’s cost and profitability estimates. We use sophisticated estimating systems and our estimating staff has significant experience in the construction industry. The project estimates form the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project cost system, thereby enabling management to monitor a project’s cost and schedule performance. Project costs are accumulated and monitored regularly against billings and payments to ensure proper tracking of cash flow on the project.
​
Most contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the owner or contractor. The terms associated with termination for convenience typically cover the reimbursement of all of our costs through a specific date, as well as all reasonable costs associated with demobilizing from the jobsite. In addition, contracts may be subject to certain completion schedule requirements which may include liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met.
​
We act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the execution of the entire contract scope of work, including subcontract work. Thus, we are potentially subject to increased costs and reputational risks associated with the failure of one or more of our subcontractors to perform their respective scope as defined in the contract. While we subcontract specialized activities such as blasting, hazardous waste removal and selected electrical/instrumentation work, we self-perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources, including field supervision, labor, and equipment.
​
Risk Management, Insurance and Bonding
​
We maintain a comprehensive schedule of insurance policies covering a broad range of exposures arising from our construction and general business operations. All of our policies have been procured with limits and deductibles or self-insured retention amounts of up to $500,000 per occurrence. We believe that our insurance program is more than adequate to protect us from all casualty and other types of insurance losses.
​
We maintain a diligent safety and risk management program that has resulted in a favorable loss experience factor. Through our safety director and the employment of a large staff of regional and site-specific safety managers, we have been able to effectively assess and control potential losses and liabilities in both the pre-construction and performance phases of our projects. Though we strongly focus on safety in the workplace, we cannot give assurances that we can prevent or reduce all injuries and/or claims in our workplace.
​
In connection with our business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds guaranteeing our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, backlog, past performance, management expertise and other factors and the surety company’s current underwriting standards. To date, we have obtained the level of surety bonds necessary to support our business.

Regulation and Environmental Requirements
​
Our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state, and municipal agencies and authorities, and international laws and regulations including with respect to:
​

● | Licensing, permitting and inspection requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Worker safety, including regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Wage and hour regulations and regulations associated with our collective bargaining agreements and unionized workforce;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements, as well as aviation activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Building and electrical codes;
--+-------------------------------


● | Applicable U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Contractor licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Immigration regulations applicable to the U.S. and cross-border employment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Labor relations and affirmative action;
--+----------------------------------------


● | Special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Protection of the environment, including regulations established by the Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies and other foreign environmental regulators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
​
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes diesel fuel, which could be negatively impacted by regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions from such sources.
​
We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under some of these laws and regulations, liability can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or leased properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current, or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge, or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations, or affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing.
​
We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change, and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.
​
Climate Change-Related Impacts
​
Our management considers climate-related risks and opportunities in connection with its long-term strategic planning and enterprise risk management process. While the overall impact on our operations continues to evolve, various aspects of climate change, as well as market and societal concerns about the future impact of climate change, have resulted and are expected to continue to result in operational opportunities and challenges. These opportunities and challenges arise from the physical risks associated with changes in climate, as well as technological advances, market developments and additional regulatory and compliance costs. 
​
Our operating results can be significantly influenced by the climates in which we operate as well as severe weather events. Changes in climate could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas, which may enable us to increase our productivity in those areas. Physical risks associated with climate

change have also increased hazards associated with certain of our operations, which in turn has increased the potential for liability and increased the costs associated with such operations. Additionally, new legislation or regulation related to climate change could increase our costs. However, due to climate change risks some utility customers are transitioning toward more sustainable sources of power generation, such as renewables, which can provide additional opportunities for our Energy/Renewables segment. For additional information regarding the risks and opportunities described above, see Risks Related to Operating Our Business in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Human Capital Management
​
Employee Profile. We believe that our employees are vital to successfully completing our projects. Our ability to maintain sufficient, continuous work for hourly employees helps us to maintain a stable, loyal workforce with an understanding of our policies and culture, which contributes to our strong performance, safety and quality record. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. In addition, we have partnerships with technical schools where we recruit and hire craft employees.
​
Several of our subsidiaries have operations that are unionized through the negotiation and execution of collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 23.8% of our hourly employees, primarily consisting of field laborers, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration. We have not experienced recent work stoppages and believe our employee and union relations are good.
​
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 2,509 salaried employees and 10,293 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel employed is subject to the volume of specialty services and construction work in progress.
​
Diversity and Inclusion. We employ a dynamic mix of people to create the strongest company possible. Our policy forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race or religion. We are an inclusive, diverse company with people of all backgrounds, experiences, cultures, styles and talents. We have a Diversity and Inclusion committee whose goal is to identify and advance efforts that aim to create and foster a workplace that is reflective of, and contributes to, the diverse communities in which we do business. The committee promotes awareness of diversity and inclusion issues in support of company-wide efforts to build a more inclusive and diverse workplace.
​
Professional and Career Development. We strive to develop and sustain a skilled labor advantage by providing thorough on-and off-site training programs, project management training, and leadership development programs. We have company-owned training facilities that support continuous skills training, including several locations where we train electric apprentices to become journeymen. We offer multiple levels of leadership programs designed to meet the needs of our employees and support the development of best-in-class talent. Our four cornerstone programs are Foreman Foundations, Extreme Ownership, Hunt for Leadership Success, and The Leadership Experience. From Foreman Foundations where employees learn the fundamentals of transitioning from a crew member to a crew leader all the way through The Leadership Experience where emerging leaders explore values-based leadership and sharpen their strategic leadership skills, our Learning and Development programs are designed to support Primoris’ vision, mission, and values and promote the growth of our greatest assets, our employees.
​
Safety, Health and Wellness. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and we pride ourselves on above average workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews monthly, and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a strong safety culture. Lost Time Injury Rate (“LTIR”) tracks the rate of injuries in the workplace which results in the employee having to take a minimum of one full working day away from work. For the year ended December 31, 2022 our LTIR rate was 0.1 compared to an industry average of 1.1 per the U.S. Bureau of Labor construction industry statistics. Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) tracks the total number of workplace safety incidents, whether leading to time away from work or not. TRIR is reported as the number of workplace safety incidents per 100 full-time workers during a one-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2022 our TRIR rate was 0.5 compared to an industry average of 2.5 per the U.S. Bureau of Labor construction industry statistics. 
​

Compensation and Benefits. As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. Our compensation programs are generally designed to align employee compensation with market practices and our performance. With respect to our executive officers, business unit management, and other senior leadership, compensation programs consist of both fixed and variable components. The fixed portion is generally set at market levels, with variable compensation designed to reward employees based on company and individual performance. In connection with these compensation programs, we grant stock-based compensation to management and key personnel at the business unit levels, which we believe helps to align incentives throughout our organization. We also enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key personnel. For additional information regarding our executive compensation, please see the information required in Item 11 “Executive Compensation,” which will be incorporated by reference from our definitive proxy statement related to our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
​
We also provide additional benefits to our employees, including a Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs. 
​
Code of Conduct. All of our employees are subject to our Code of Conduct, which includes guidance and requirements concerning, among other things, general business ethics, including policies concerning the environment, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption, harassment and discrimination, data security and privacy, and insider trading, and Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy, which includes guidance and requirements concerning, among other things, interactions with government officials; provision of gifts, entertainment and hospitality; and charitable and political contributions
