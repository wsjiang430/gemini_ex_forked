ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Lincoln Educational Services Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”, as applicable) provide diversified career-oriented post-secondary education to recent high school graduates and working adults.  The Company, which currently operates 22 campuses in 14 states, offers programs in skilled trades (which include HVAC, welding and computerized numerical control and electrical and electronic systems technology, among other programs), automotive technology, healthcare services (which include nursing, dental assistant and medical administrative assistant, among other programs), hospitality services (which include culinary, therapeutic massage, cosmetology and aesthetics) and information technology (which consists of information technology programs). The schools operate under Lincoln Technical Institute, Lincoln College of Technology, Lincoln Culinary Institute, and Euphoria Institute of Beauty Arts and Sciences and associated brand names.  Most of the campuses serve major metropolitan markets and each typically offers courses in multiple areas of study.  Five of the campuses are destination schools, which attract students from across the United States and, in some cases, from abroad. The Company’s other campuses primarily attract students from their local communities and surrounding areas.  All of the campuses are nationally accredited and are eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education (the “DOE”) and applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions which allow students to apply for and access federal student loans as well as other forms of financial aid. The Company was incorporated in New Jersey in 2003 as the successor-in-interest to various acquired schools including Lincoln Technical Institute, Inc. which opened its first campus in Newark, New Jersey in 1946. 
 
Our business is organized into three reportable business segments: (a) Transportation and Skilled Trades, (b) Healthcare and Other Professions (“HOPS”), and (c) Transitional, which refers to campuses that have been marked for closing and are currently being taught out.  On November 3, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a plan to close the Somerville, Massachusetts campus by the end of 2023.  As of December 31, 2022, the Somerville campus is the only campus classified in the Transitional Segment.
 
On June 30, 2022, the Company executed a lease for a 55,000 square foot facility to house a second Atlanta, Georgia area campus. The build-out is continuing to advance according to plan and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred approximately $0.4 million in capital expenditures, mostly relating to architectural fees and approximately $0.3 million in rent.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 12,388 students enrolled at 22 campuses.  Our average enrollment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was 12,894 students and our revenues were $348.3 million, which represented an increase of 3.9% over the prior fiscal year.  For more information relating to our revenues, profits and financial condition, please refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We believe that we provide our students with the highest quality career-oriented training available for our areas of study in our markets thereby serving students, local employers and their communities. The skills gap continues to expand as talent retires faster than new employees are hired and as the need for education and training increases in all careers with the accelerating pace of technological change. We offer programs in areas of study that we believe are typically underserved by traditional providers of post-secondary education and for which we believe there exists significant demand among students and employers. Furthermore, we believe our convenient class scheduling, career-focused curricula and emphasis on job placement offer our students valuable advantages that have been previously unaddressed by the traditional academic sector. By combining substantial distance training with traditional classroom-based training led by experienced instructors, we believe we offer our students a unique opportunity to develop practical job skills in many of the key areas of expected job demand. We believe these job skills enable our students to compete effectively for employment opportunities and to pursue salary and career advancement.
 
Business Strategy
    We strive to strengthen our position as a leading provider of career‑oriented post-secondary education by continuing to pursue the following strategy:
 

• | Increase Operating Efficiency. Our existing schools are a result of strategic acquisitions and expansion, and, while the programs may be very similar across the campuses, each campus operates on its own calendar. As we move most of our curriculum to a hybrid teaching model of virtual and traditional classroom-based in-person training, we are taking this opportunity to also standardize the programs and course calendars so that new students will begin on the same day across all campuses. In addition, we are removing certain functions from the campuses and centralizing them to remove distractions from the campuses while creating more efficient and effective services for our students. By simplifying, centralizing and standardizing our operations, we believe we will improve our margins and be more scalable.

   Index

• | Replicate Programs and Expand Existing Areas of Study. Whenever possible, we seek to replicate programs across our campuses. In addition, we believe we can leverage our operations to expand our program offerings in existing areas of study and new high-demand areas of study in both our Transportation and Skilled Trades Segment and HOPS Segment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize Utilization of Existing Facilities. We are focused on improving capacity utilization of existing facilities through increased enrollments, the introduction of new programs and partnerships with industry. In addition, we see opportunities to reduce our real estate needs with the advancement of our hybrid teaching model that we will continue to roll out over the next two years. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Geographically. We plan to deploy our resources to strengthen our brand, invest in new programs and seek opportunities to expand our footprint into new markets. We have a solid portfolio of corporate and industry partners requesting that we explore new geographies to serve them better. Regardless of whether we expand our current campuses to take advantage of the operating leverage or establish new campuses, our goal is to remain competitive and prudently deploy our resources. Our expansion plans may be achieved organically through the opening of new campuses with existing resources or through acquisitions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Teaching Platform. Using the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we can continue to transform our in-person education model to a hybrid teaching model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. The hybrid teaching model provides students with greater flexibility and convenience, which should help us attract more students. Moreover, we believe blended learning will create operating efficiencies that will enable us to contain tuition increases over the coming years and thus provide our students with a higher return on investment in their education in addition to the increased flexibility and convenience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Market. We know that many potential students do not have the time and resources to take a one-year program in order to get into the workforce. Consequently, we are exploring opportunities for programs that are shorter in duration and less expensive but more compressed and intensive, providing skills sufficient to gain employment. We are developing programs internally as well as in concert with industry partners. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our graduates obtain entry-level positions with both small and large corporations.  As of December 31, 2022, we offered these programs at five of our campuses.
Marketing and Student Recruitment
 
We utilize a variety of marketing and recruiting methods to attract students and increase enrollment. Our marketing and recruiting efforts are targeted at prospective students who are high school graduates entering the workforce, or who are currently underemployed or unemployed and require additional training to enter or re-enter the workforce.
 
 Marketing and Advertising.  We utilize a fully integrated marketing approach in our lead generation and admissions process that includes the use of traditional media such as television, radio, billboards, direct mail, a variety of print media and event marketing campaigns intended to raise brand awareness. In addition, we continually grow and enhance our digital marketing efforts, which include paid search, paid and organic social media, search engine optimization, online video and display advertising and pay-per-lead channels. These channels currently drive the majority of our new student leads and enrollments. Our fully integrated marketing campaigns direct prospective students to contact us directly or visit our website or other customized landing pages on the Internet where they will find details regarding our programs and campuses and can request additional information regarding the programs that interest them.  Prospective students may also apply for admission online. Our internal systems enable us to closely monitor and track the effectiveness of each marketing execution on a daily or weekly basis and make adjustments accordingly to enhance our efficiency and limit our student acquisition costs.


Referrals.  Referrals from current students, high school counselors and satisfied graduates and their employers have historically represented approximately 14% of our new student starts. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, referrals were approximately 13% of our new student starts.  Our school administrators actively work with our current students to encourage them to recommend our programs to prospective students. We endeavor to build and retain strong relationships with high school guidance counselors and instructors by offering annual seminars at our training facilities to further familiarize these individuals on the strengths of our programs.
Recruiting.  Our recruiting efforts are conducted by a group of approximately 250 campus-based and field representatives who meet directly with prospective students during presentations conducted at high schools, in the prospective students’ homes or during a visit to one of our campuses.  We also recruit adult career-seekers or career-changers through our campus-based representatives.
 
 During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 we recruited approximately 23% of our students directly out of high school.  Field sales continue to be a large part of our business and developing local community relationships is one of our most important recruiting functions.


Student Admissions, Enrollment and Retention
    Admissions.  In order to attend our schools, students must have either a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate (or General Education Development Certificate, GED). In addition, students must complete an admissions interview and complete a learner assessment. We take admissions requirements very seriously as they are the best indicators of our students’ likelihood for program success and completion thus leading to successful employment in the industry. The learner assessment is a questionnaire designed to discover student challenges and address them prior to attending. While each of our programs has different admissions criteria, we screen all applications and counsel prospective students on the most appropriate program to increase the likelihood that our students complete the requisite coursework and obtain and sustain employment following graduation.
Enrollment.  We enroll students continuously throughout the year, with our largest classes enrolling in late summer or early fall following high school graduation. As of December 31, 2022, we had 12,388 students enrolled at 22 campuses and our average enrollment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was 12,894 students.
Retention.  To maximize student retention, the staff at each school is trained to recognize the early warning signs of a potential drop in retention and to assist and advise students on academic, financial and employment matters. We monitor our retention rates by instructor, course, program and school. When we become aware that a particular instructor or program is experiencing a higher than normal dropout rate, we quickly seek to determine the cause of the problem and attempt to correct it. When we identify that a student is experiencing difficulty academically, we offer tutoring. As we moved to online delivery of instruction we saw a slight decline in our student retention rate, but we believe this is temporary and will improve as our as faculty becomes better skilled at hybrid teaching and to ensure that this happens, we have developed online teacher training for all faculty.
   Index
Job Placement
    We believe that assisting our graduates in securing employment after completing their program of study is critical to our mission as a post-secondary educational institution as well as to our ability to attract high quality students and enhance our reputation in the industry.  In addition, we believe that high job placement rates result in low student loan default rates, an important requirement for continued participation in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (“Title IV Programs”). See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment—Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.”  Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective graduate placement program. Our non-destination schools work closely with local employers to ensure that we are training students with skills that local employers seek. Each school has an advisory council comprised of local employers who provide us with direct feedback on how well we are preparing our students to succeed in the workplace. This enables us to tailor our programs to the marketplace. The placement staff in each of our destination schools maintains databases of potential employers throughout the country, allowing us to more effectively assist our graduates in securing employment in their career fields upon graduation. Throughout each year, we hold numerous job fairs at our facilities where we provide the opportunity for our students to meet and interact with potential employers.  In addition, many of our schools have internship programs that provide our students with opportunities to work with employers prior to graduation. For example, some of the students in our automotive programs have the opportunity to complete a portion of their hands-on training in an actual work environment. In addition, some of our students in health sciences programs are required to participate in an externship program in which they work in the field as part of their career training. We also assist students with resume writing, interviewing and other job search skills.
Human Capital Management
    Overview
 
We believe that each of our employees plays an important role in our enterprise.  This is particularly true of our faculty.  We are focused on attracting and retaining the highly qualified personnel needed to support our objectives of providing superior education in the programs that our schools provide.  We believe that the diversity and inclusion of our personnel is an essential component for providing a meaningful student experience by drawing upon a variety of backgrounds and experiences.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,121 employees, including 557 full-time instructors and 433 part-time instructors, and approximately 1,131 employees serving in various administrative and management positions.  We had no seasonal workers. The number of individuals comprising our workforce increased by approximately 3.2% in the most recently completed fiscal year.
 
Our Board of Directors regularly reviews with management the following areas regarding our human capital management:
 
Staffing Our Schools
 
Our schools typically are staffed by a school president, a director of career services, a director of education, a director of administrative services, a director of admissions and, of course, a variety of instructors, all of whom are industry professionals with experience in the areas of study at that particular school.
 
Our average student to teacher ratio was approximately 16 to 1 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We strive to create a culture of diversity and inclusion through our human capital management practices.  The achievement of workforce diversity is one important goal in the outreach efforts for recruitment of professionals.  As a result, since January 1, 2018, our diverse workforce percentage has increased from 33.5% to 42.9%.  Further, the generational range of our workforce, as of December 31, 2022, was 26% Baby Boomers, 41% Gen Xers and 24% Millennials.  The largest growth in the generational workforce makeup was in the Millennial and Gen Z groups.  Our human resources programs work to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all forms and our Human Resources Department has established a diversity and inclusion policy intended to assist us in meeting our goals of establishing an environment of inclusion and opportunity in hiring, promotions, training and development, working conditions and compensation.
   Index
Development, Training and Retention
 
The Company employs a staff to attract and engage talent and applies fully integrated recruiting software to track and manage hiring processes for our campuses and corporate functions.  We hire our faculty in accordance with established criteria, including relevant work experience, educational background and accreditation and state regulatory standards. We require meaningful industry experience of our teaching staff in order to maintain the high quality of instruction in all of our programs that we expect and to address current and industry-specific issues in our course content. In addition, we provide intensive instructional training and continuing education, including quarterly instructional development seminars, annual reviews, technical upgrade training, faculty development plans and weekly staff meetings.
 
The Company acknowledges the relevance of managing productivity and efficiency of its workforce.  The Company uses current technology resources for sales and student services tasks, education support, graduate placement services, and internal talent management. Through the application of these technology tools, productivity data is obtained for key positions and used for process improvement, training, and evaluative purposes.
 
The Company recognizes the value to both the Company and our students of employee knowledge and skill development throughout their careers and of preparing current employees for succession opportunities.  Therefore, employees receive position-based training, as well as online access to a multitude of programs designed to support their effectiveness and growth potential.  The Company identifies high-performing employee participants for acceleration training programs to develop internal candidates for succession opportunities in key functions.
 
Labor Relations
 
We believe that we have good relationships with all of our employees.  At six of our 22 campuses, the teaching professionals are represented by various unions. These approximately 200 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2023 and 2025.  Those agreements expiring in the short term are in the process of renegotiation.  We believe that we have good relationships with these unions and with the employees covered by these collective bargaining agreements and do not foresee issues with entering into satisfactory new agreements.
Our Management
 
We believe that our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth strategy and continue to drive positive educational and employment outcomes for our students.  For a discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Competition
 
The for-profit, post-secondary education industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented with no one provider controlling significant market share.  Direct competition between career-oriented schools like ours and traditional four-year colleges or universities is limited. Thus, our main competitors are other for-profit, career-oriented schools, not-for-profit public schools and private schools, and public and private two-year junior and community colleges, most of which are eligible to receive funding under the federal programs of student financial aid authorized by Title IV Programs. Competition is generally based on location, the type of programs offered, the quality of instruction, placement rates, reputation, recruiting and tuition rates; therefore, our competition is different in each market depending on, among other things, the availability of other options. Public institutions are generally able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools. In addition, some of our other competitors have a more extensive network of schools and campuses, which enables them to recruit students more efficiently from a wider geographic area. Nevertheless, we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our local markets because of the diversity of our program offerings, quality of instruction, the strength of our brands, our reputation and our graduates’ success in securing employment after completing their programs of study.
    Our competition differs in each market depending on the curriculum that we offer. For example, a school offering automotive technology, healthcare services and skilled trades programs will have a different group of competitors than a school offering healthcare services and IT technology programs. Also, because schools can add new programs within six to 12 months, competition can emerge relatively quickly. Moreover, with the introduction of online education, the number of competitors in each market has increased because students can now attend classes from an online institution. On average, each of our schools has at least three direct competitors and at least a dozen indirect competitors.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We use limited amounts of hazardous materials at our training facilities and campuses, and generate small quantities of regulated waste such as used oil, antifreeze, paint and car batteries. As a result, our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. We are also required to obtain permits for our air emissions and to meet operational and maintenance requirements at certain of our campuses. In the event we do not maintain compliance with any of these laws and regulations, or are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for cleanup or damages and fines or penalties. Climate change has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations.
   Index
Regulatory Environment
 
The education industry is highly regulated by a wide range of federal and state agencies as well as institutional and program-based accrediting agencies including the DOE.  The vast regulatory schemes to which our industry is subject covers a significant portion of our operations such as our programs, instructional staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting efforts and facilities, among other things.  The various regulatory bodies applicable to our business periodically issue new requirements and revise existing requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. These regulatory requirements also impact our ability to expand our existing campuses, acquire new campuses and revise and expand upon our existing programs or institute new programs.
 
We also are subject to oversight by other federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Internal Revenue Service and the Departments of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Defense (“DOD”), Treasury, Labor, and Justice. The following discussion provides a description of the regulatory scheme to which we are subject. We cannot predict how any of the regulatory requirements to which we are subject will be applied or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with such requirements in the future.
 
Federal Regulatory Matters
 
The various approvals granted by the regulatory entities to which we are subject are what allow our schools to operate and to participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs that assist students in paying for their education the most significant of which are the federal student aid programs administered by the DOE under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the “HEA”).  The HEA and the regulations of the DOE specify extensive criteria and numerous standards that we must satisfy in order to participate in federal financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA (“Title IV Programs”). Generally, to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state where it is physically located, be accredited by an accreditor recognized by the DOE, be certified as an eligible institution by the DOE, offer at least one eligible program of education, and comply with other statutory and regulatory requirements. Students seeking financial aid under Title IV Programs obtain access to federal student financial aid through a DOE-prescribed application and eligibility certification.  Each of our schools currently participates in Title IV Programs. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 74% (calculated based on cash receipts) of our revenues were derived from Title IV Programs.
    Also, all of our schools are currently offering both online and in-person learning and accrediting agencies and some state bodies require schools to obtain approval and meet certain requirements in order to offer programs via distance education in states where the school does not have a campus.  The DOE also generally requires schools that offer a program through distance education to students in a state in which the school is not physically located to meet the requirements of the state in order to offer programs by distance education in the state.  All of our schools are currently approved to offer both distance and in-person learning.
 
State Authorization
 
To operate and offer postsecondary programs (including in-person and online programs, degree and diploma programs and certificate programs), and to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs, each of our schools must be authorized and maintain authorization from the state in which it is physically located. Further, in order for a school to engage in educational or recruiting activities outside of its state of physical location, that school also may be required to obtain and maintain authorization from the states in which it is recruiting students and teaching programs. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state and is extensive in some states. State laws may establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and equipment, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, student outcomes reporting, disclosure obligations to students, limitations on mandatory arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe standards of financial responsibility and mandate that institutions post surety bonds. We have posted surety bonds on behalf of our schools and education representatives with multiple states in an aggregate amount of approximately $15.3 million. Currently, each of our schools is authorized by the applicable state education agencies in the states in which the school is physically located and in which it recruits students.
 
States can and often do revisit, revise, and expand their regulations governing postsecondary education and recruiting.  For example, in July 2022, New Jersey enacted law requiring the New Jersey Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (“NJOSHE”) and New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (“NJDLWD”) to adopt regulations establishing a performance quality standard for career-oriented programs of study offered by institutions of higher education and proprietary degree-granting institutions, as well as all programs at private career schools in New Jersey.  In establishing the standard, the NJOSHE and NJDLWD must consider the ratio of the tuition and fees charged to students, net of any institutional grant aid, to the average earnings of New Jersey workers employed in the specific occupation for which the career-oriented program prepares students and must ensure that career-oriented programs of study offered by institutions of higher education and degree-granting proprietary institutions, as well as all programs at private career schools, meet a minimum acceptable level of performance.  The law also requires the NJOSHE and NJDLWD to take action on a program that does not meet the minimum acceptable level of performance, including suspending or terminating that program, as well as possibly taking additional action to suspend or revoke the license of the institution of higher education, proprietary degree-granting institution or private career school to award postsecondary credentials. Our six schools in New Jersey currently operate as private career schools and will be subject to the new regulations. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this new law on our business and will be monitoring the future rulemaking process.
 


   Index
If any of our schools fail to comply with state licensing requirements, they may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. If any one of our schools lost its authorization from the education agency of the state in which the school is located, or failed to comply with the DOE’s state authorization requirements, that school would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, the Title IV Program eligibility of its related additional locations could be affected, the impacted schools would be unable to offer its programs, and we could be forced to close the schools. If one of our schools lost its state authorization from a state other than the state in which the school is located, the school would not be able to recruit students or to operate in that state.
Accreditation
 
Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which a school submits to ongoing qualitative and quantitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the school’s instructional programs, and a grant of accreditation is generally viewed as confirmation that the school’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the schools they accredit to ensure that each school has the resources necessary to perform its educational mission.
    Accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE is required for an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs. In order to be recognized by the DOE, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions. As of December 31, 2022, all 22 of our campuses are nationally accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (the “ACCSC”).  On October 28, 2021, the DOE announced that it had notified ACCSC that a decision on the recognition by the DOE of ACCSC as an accrediting agency was being deferred pending the submission of additional information about ACCSC’s monitoring, evaluation, and actions related to high-risk institutions. The DOE regulations indicate that ACCSC may appeal an adverse decision to the DOE Secretary and potentially to federal court.
 
If the DOE withdraws the recognition of an accrediting agency, the HEA indicates that the DOE may continue the eligibility of qualified institutions accredited by the accrediting agency for a period of up to 18 months from the date of the withdrawal of the DOE’s recognition of the accrediting agency. If provided, this period would provide time for institutions to apply for accreditation from another DOE-recognized accrediting body. The DOE could impose provisional certification and other conditions and restrictions on such institutions during this time period. If the DOE declines to continue its recognition of ACCSC and if the subsequent period for obtaining accreditation from another DOE-recognized accrediting agency lapses before we obtain accreditation from another DOE-recognized accrediting agency (or if the DOE does not provide such a period for institutions to obtain other accreditation), our schools could lose Title IV eligibility.

If one of our schools fails to comply with accrediting commission requirements, the institution and its main and/or branch campuses are subject to the loss of accreditation or may be placed on probation or a special monitoring or reporting status which, if the noncompliance is not resolved, could result in loss of accreditation or restrictions on the addition of new locations, new programs, or other substantive changes. If any one of our schools loses its accreditation, students attending that school would no longer be eligible to receive Title IV Program funding.
 
The DOE recently announced its intention to commence a negotiated rulemaking process in April 2023 on a number of topics including amendments to the regulations on accreditation, including regulations associated with the standards relating to the DOE’s recognition of accrediting agencies and accreditation procedures as a component of institutional eligibility for participation in the Title IV Program.
 
Programmatic accreditation is yet another approval necessary in certain circumstances.  Specifically, it is the process through which specific programs are reviewed and approved by industry and program-specific accrediting entities. Although programmatic accreditation is not generally necessary for Title IV Program eligibility, such accreditation may be required to allow students to sit for certain licensure exams or to work in a particular profession or career or to meet other requirements.

Nature of Federal and State Support for Post-Secondary Education
    As noted above, the federal government provides a substantial part of the financial support for post-secondary education through Title IV Programs, in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible by the DOE. Most aid under Title IV Programs is awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the expected amount a student and his or her family can reasonably contribute to that cost. A recipient of Title IV Program funds must maintain a satisfactory grade point average and progress in a timely manner toward completion of his or her program of study and must meet other applicable eligibility requirements for the receipt of Title IV Program funds. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV Program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students and provide reports on recipient data.
Other Financial Assistance Programs
 
Some of our students receive financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as programs administered by the VA. In addition, some states also provide financial aid to our students in the form of grants, loans or scholarships. The eligibility requirements for state financial aid and these other federal aid programs vary among the funding agencies and by program. States that provide financial aid to our students are facing significant budgetary constraints and some of them have reduced the level of state financial aid available to our students.  Due to state budgetary shortfalls and constraints in certain states in which we operate, we believe that the overall level of state financial aid for our students is likely to continue to decrease in the near term, but we cannot predict how significant any such reductions will be or how long they will last.  Federal budgetary shortfalls and constraints, or decisions by federal lawmakers to limit or prohibit access by our institutions or their students to federal financial aid, could result in a decrease in the level of federal financial aid for our students.
 
In fiscal year 2022, we derived approximately 74% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from veterans’ benefits programs, which include the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Veteran Readiness and Employment services.  To continue participation in veterans’ benefits programs, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA, including that the institution must, among other things, report on the enrollment status of eligible students, maintain student records and make such records available for inspection, follow rules applicable to the individual benefits programs, comply with rules applicable to distance education and hybrid programs, and comply with applicable limits on the percentage of students having a portion of their tuition or other institutional charges paid by the school or with certain veterans’ benefits.
 
The VA shares responsibility for VA benefit approval and oversight with designated State Approving Agencies (“SAAs”). SAAs play a critical role in evaluating institutions and their programs to determine if they meet VA benefit eligibility requirements. Processes and approval criteria, as well as interpretation of applicable requirements, can vary from state to state. Therefore, approval in one state does not necessarily result in approval in all states.
 
The VA imposes limitations on the percentage of students per program who have a portion of their tuition or other institutional charges paid by the school or with certain veterans’ benefits, unless the program qualifies for certain exemptions. If the VA determines that a program is out of compliance with these limitations, the VA will continue to provide benefits to current students, but new students will not be eligible to use their veterans’ benefits for an affected program until we demonstrate compliance. Additionally, the VA requires a campus be in operation for two years before it can apply to participate in VA benefit programs. All of our campuses are eligible to participate in VA education benefit programs.
 
During 2012, President Obama signed an Executive Order directing the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), the VA and DOE to establish “Principles of Excellence” (“Principles”), based on certain guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, to apply to educational institutions receiving federal funding for service members, veterans and family members. As requested, we provided written confirmation of our intent to comply with the Principles to the VA in June 2012. We are required to comply with the Principles to continue recruitment activities on military installations. Additionally, there is a requirement to execute a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the
 DOD as well as with certain individual installations. Each of our institutions has an MOU with the DOD.  If our campuses fail to comply with VA, DOD, SAA, and other requirements applicable to financial aid programs for veterans or active military members, our schools and students could lose access to this funding or could be subject to restrictions or conditions on ability to receive such funding.
 
Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
 
As noted above, to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be authorized to offer its programs by the relevant state education agencies in the state in which it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE and be certified as eligible by the DOE. The DOE will certify an institution to participate in Title IV Programs only after reviewing and approving an institution’s application to participate in Title IV Programs. The DOE defines an institution to consist of both a main campus and its additional locations, if any. Under this definition, for DOE purposes as of December 31, 2022 we had the following three institutions, collectively consisting of three main campuses and 19 additional locations:

Each institution must periodically apply to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs. The institution also must apply for recertification when it undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control and may come under DOE review when it undergoes a substantive change that requires the submission of an application, such as opening an additional location or raising the highest academic credential it offers.  All institutions are recertified on various dates for various periods of time.  The following table sets forth the expiration dates for each of our institutions’ current Title IV Program participation agreements:
 

Institution | Expiration Date of Current Program Participation Agreement

Iselin, NJ | December 31, 20241 
Indianapolis, IN | December 31, 20241 
New Britain, CT | December 31, 20241 


1 | Provisionally certified.
--+-------------------------

 
The DOE typically provides provisional certification to an institution following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control and also may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons, including, but not limited to, noncompliance with certain standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility.  The DOE provisionally certified all of our institutions based on findings in recent audits of each institution’s Title IV Program compliance that the DOE alleges identified deficiencies related to DOE regulations regarding an institution’s level of administrative capability.  An institution that is provisionally certified receives fewer due process rights than those received by other institutions in the event the DOE takes certain adverse actions against the institution, is required to obtain prior DOE approvals of new campuses and educational programs, and may be subject to heightened scrutiny by the DOE.  Provisional certification makes it easier for the DOE to revoke or decline to renew our Title IV eligibility if the DOE under the new administration chooses to take such an action against us and other provisionally certified for-profit schools without undergoing a formal administrative appeal process.  The DOE could attempt to use an institution’s provisional certification as a basis for imposing additional conditions or restrictions on the institution, However, provisional certification does not otherwise limit an institution’s access to Title IV Program funds.  The DOE previously initiated a negotiated rulemaking process that was considering, among other issues, establishing rules to authorize additional conditions and restrictions on provisionally certified institutions.  See “Regulatory Environment – Negotiated Rulemaking.”  After announcing a delay in this process in June 2022, the DOE announced in January 2023 its intention to publish proposed rules on this subject in April 2023.
 


   Index
As noted above, the DOE is responsible for overseeing compliance with Title IV Program requirements. As a result, each of our schools is subject to detailed oversight and review, and must comply with a complex framework of laws and regulations. Additionally, the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretation of existing laws and regulations.
 
Significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include the following:
 
Congressional Action. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV Programs. Congress periodically revises the HEA and other laws governing Title IV Programs.  It is not known if or when Congress will pass final legislation that comprehensively reauthorizes and amends the HEA or other laws affecting U.S. federal student aid.
 
In addition, Congress reviews and determines federal appropriations for Title IV Programs on an annual basis. Congress can also make changes in the laws affecting Title IV Programs in the annual appropriations bills and in other laws it enacts between the HEA reauthorizations such as its recent amendment to the 90/10 rule in the HEA.  See “Regulatory Environment – 90/10 Rule.” Because a significant percentage of our revenues are derived from Title IV Programs, any action by Congress or the DOE that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding, that limits or restricts the ability of our schools, programs, or students to receive funding through the Title IV Programs, or that imposes new restrictions or constraints upon our business or operations could reduce our student enrollment and our revenues, and could increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with Title IV Program requirements. The potential for changes that may be adverse to us and other for-profit schools like ours may increase as a result of changes in political leadership.  Further, current requirements for student or school participation in Title IV Programs may change or one or more of the present Title IV Programs could be replaced by other programs with materially different student or school eligibility requirements.
 
Gainful Employment.  In October 2014, the DOE issued final gainful employment regulations requiring each educational program offered by our institutions to achieve threshold rates in at least one of two debt measure categories related to an annual debt to annual earnings ratio and an annual debt to discretionary income ratio.  In 2019, the DOE rescinded the gainful employment regulations.  The DOE initiated a negotiated rulemaking process in January 2022 that was considering, among other issues, establishing new gainful employment requirements that would be applicable to all of our educational programs.  After announcing a delay in this process in June 2022, the DOE recently announced its intention to publish proposed rules on this subject in April 2023.  The implementation of new gainful employment regulations could require us to eliminate or modify certain educational programs, could result in the loss of our students’ access to Title IV Program funds for the affected programs, and could have a significant impact on the rate at which students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations.
 
Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations.  The DOE’s current Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations establish processes for borrowers to receive from the DOE a discharge of the obligation to repay certain Title IV Program loans based on certain acts or omissions by the institution or a covered party. The current regulations also establish processes for the DOE to seek recovery from the institution of the amount of discharged loans.
 
 On November 1, 2022, the DOE published final regulations on Borrower Defense to Repayment and other topics with a general effective date of July 1, 2023.  The final regulations are extensive and generally make it easier for borrowers to obtain discharges of student loans and for the DOE to assess liabilities and other sanctions on institutions based on the loan discharges.  Among other things, the final regulations establish a new process and standard for evaluating borrower applications for loan discharges that would apply to all claims submitted or pending as of the anticipated July 1, 2023 effective date of the regulations.  The new process and standard differ from the prior regulations that established a separate process and standard for each of three categories of loans depending on the date the loans were disbursed to students (i.e., prior to July 1, 2017, between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, and on or after July 1, 2020).  As a result, the new process and standard will apply not only to loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, but also to older loans as long as the discharge requests are still pending as of July 1, 2023 or are submitted on or after July 1, 2023.
 
The final DOE regulations continue to permit the imposition of liabilities on institutions for the amount of discharged loans.  For loans disbursed prior to July 1, 2023, the DOE indicated that it will not use the same standard for determining institutional liabilities under the new regulations as it will use for determining whether to discharge the loans.  Instead, the DOE indicated that it will seek recoupment from an institution for such loans only if they would have been discharged under the standards used under current regulations based on the date the loans were disbursed to students.  However, the new regulations will make it easier for the DOE to recover from the institution the liabilities that the DOE elects to impose.
 
 The new regulations also expand the types of conduct that could result in a discharge of student loans including:  1) an expanded list of substantial misrepresentations; 2) a new section regarding substantial omissions of fact; 3) breaches of contract; 4) a new section regarding aggressive and deceptive recruitment; or 5) state or federal judgments or final DOE actions that could result in a borrower defense claim.  Some of these forms of conduct also could result in other sanctions against the institutions.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business – Regulatory Environment – Substantial Misrepresentation.”  The new regulations also make it easier for borrowers to qualify for loan discharges by enabling the DOE to permit group consideration of borrower claims under certain circumstances either on its own initiative or at the request of state requestors or certain third-party legal assistance organizations (which could enable the DOE to evaluate and rule on a broad group of claims more quickly than evaluating the claims individually), establishing a rebuttable presumption that borrowers in a group claim reasonably relied on (and were impacted by) acts or omissions giving rise to a borrower defense, establishing a Borrower Defense to Repayment claim based on a separate state law standard if the DOE does not approve claims based on one of the other types of conduct for borrowers with loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, and providing the DOE with the discretion to reopen its decisions at any time in accordance with regulatory requirements




   Index
 The new regulations also reinstitute a general prohibition on institutions requiring borrowers to agree to mandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements and requiring students to waive the ability to participate in a class-action lawsuit with respect to a borrower defense claim.  The new regulations also require institutions to disclose publicly and notify the DOE of judicial and arbitration filings and awards pertaining to borrower defense claims. The new regulations also include provisions on other topics including public service loan forgiveness, eliminating capitalization on student loans in some cases, total and permanent disability discharges, and closed school loan discharges (see “Closed School Loan Discharges”), and false certification discharges (e.g., when an institution falsely certifies an ineligible student’s eligibility for loans).
 
 We are in the process of evaluating the impact of these new and complex regulations on our business and the changes from the proposed regulations, but the final regulations impose new requirements and processes that will make it easier for borrowers to obtain discharges of their loans and for the DOE to recover liabilities from institutions and impose other sanctions.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business – Regulatory Environment – Negotiated Rulemaking.”


In April 2021, the Company received communication from the DOE indicating that the DOE was in receipt of a number of borrower defense applications containing allegations concerning our schools and requiring that the DOE undertake a fact-finding process pursuant to DOE regulations. Among other things, the communication outlines a process by which the DOE would provide to us the applications and allow us the opportunity to submit responses to them. Further, the communication outlines certain information requests, relating to the period between 2007 and 2013, in connection with the DOE’s preliminary review of the borrower defense applications. Based upon publicly available information, it appears that the DOE has undertaken similar reviews of other educational institutions which have also been the subject of various borrower defense applications. We have received the borrower application claims and have completed the process of thoroughly reviewing and responding to each borrower application as well as providing information in response to the DOE’s requests.
 
We are not able to predict the outcome of the DOE’s review at this time. If the DOE disagrees with our legal and factual grounds for contesting the applications, the DOE may impose liabilities on the Company based on the discharge of the loans at issue in the pending applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If the proposed Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations take effect on July 1, 2023, and if any or all of the Borrower Defense to Repayment applications remain pending, the DOE could attempt to apply the new regulations to the pending applications which could increase the likelihood of the DOE granting the application because the proposed regulations are more favorable to borrowers.
 
In August 2022, the Company received communication from the DOE regarding a single borrower defense application submitted on behalf of a group of students who were enrolled in a single educational program at two of our schools in Massachusetts between 2010 and 2013.  The communication, which did not state who submitted the application or when it was submitted, asked us to submit a response within 60 calendar days.  We timely responded to the DOE’s letter, notwithstanding the absence of a response to our request for additional information about the student claims.  We are waiting for the DOE’s reply to our response and to our request for information about the student claims.  Given the early stage of this matter, management is not able to predict the outcome of the DOE’s review at this time. If the DOE disagrees with our legal and factual grounds for contesting the application, the DOE may impose liabilities on the Company based on the discharge of the loans at issue in the pending application, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
On June 22, 2022, the DOE and the plaintiffs in a lawsuit before a federal court in California submitted a proposed settlement agreement to the court.  The plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the DOE failed to timely decide and resolve Borrower Defense to Repayment applications submitted to the DOE. If approved, the settlement would result in full discharge and refund payments to covered student borrowers who have asserted a Borrower Defense to Repayment to the DOE and whose borrower defense claims have not yet been granted or denied on the merits.
 
 The lawsuit, Sweet v. Cardona, No. 3:19-cv-3674 (N.D. Cal.), is a class action filed on June 25, 2019 against the DOE in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California submitted by a group of students, none of whom attended any of our institutions.  We were not a party to the lawsuit when it was filed.  The plaintiffs requested that the court compel the DOE to start approving or denying the pending applications.  The court granted class certification and defined the class of plaintiffs generally to include all people who borrowed a Title IV Direct loan or FFEL loan, who have asserted a Borrower Defense to Repayment claim to the DOE, and whose borrower defense claim has not been granted or denied on the merits.  We have not received notice or confirmation directly from the DOE of the number of student borrowers who have submitted Borrower Defense to Repayment claims related to our institutions.




   Index
The proposed settlement agreement includes a long list of institutions, including Lincoln Technical Institute and Lincoln College of Technology.  Under the proposed settlement, the DOE would agree to discharge loans and refund all prior loan payments to each class member with loan debt associated with an institution on the list (which includes our institutions), including borrowers whose applications the DOE previously denied after October 30, 2019.  The DOE and the plaintiffs stated in a court filing that this provision is intended to provide for automatic relief for students at the listed schools which the DOE estimates to total 200,000 class members.  We anticipate that the DOE believes that the class includes the borrowers with claims to which we have submitted responses to the DOE although it is possible that the class also includes borrowers with claims for which we have not received notice from the DOE or an opportunity to respond.  The parties also stated that the DOE has determined that attendance at one of the institutions on the list justifies presumptive relief based on strong indicia regarding substantial misconduct by the institutions, whether credibly alleged or in some instances proven, and the high rate of class members with applications related to the listed schools.  The proposed settlement agreement provides a separate process for reviewing claims associated with schools that are not on the list.  It is unclear whether the DOE would seek to impose liabilities on us or other schools or take other actions or impose other sanctions on us or other schools based on relief provided to students under the proposed settlement agreement (particularly if the DOE provides relief without evaluating or accounting for legal and factual information provided to the DOE by us and other schools or without providing us and other schools with notice and an opportunity to respond to some of the claims).
 
In July 2022, the Company and certain other school companies submitted motions to intervene in the lawsuit in order to protect our interests in the finalization and implementation of any settlement agreement that the court might approve.  We noted in the motion that the proposed settlement agreement introduced, for the first time, the prospect that the DOE would “automatically” and fully discharge loans and refund payments to student borrowers without adjudication of the merits of the students’ borrower-defense applications in accordance with the DOE’s borrower-defense regulations and without ensuring that we and other institutions can defend against allegations asserted in individual borrower-defense applications. In addition, we also asserted that it would be unlawful and inappropriate if the DOE sought recoupment against us based on loans that were forgiven under the proposed settlement agreement without providing us with an opportunity to address the claims or accounting for our responses to the claims already submitted which we believe is required by the regulations.  We also asserted that the lawsuit and the potential loan discharges could result in reputational harm to us and our institutions and could result in other actions against us by other federal and state agencies or by current and former students.
 
The court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement agreement on August 4, 2022, and also granted our motion for permissive intervention for the purpose of objecting to and opposing the class action settlement.  On September 22, 2022, the DOE and the plaintiffs filed a joint motion for final approval of the settlement.  In that joint motion, the DOE and the plaintiffs reported that approximately 179,000 new borrower defense applications had been submitted to the DOE as of September 20, 2022.  We and the three other intervenor schools filed briefs opposing final approval.
 
In an Order dated November 16, 2022, District Court Judge William Alsup granted final approval of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, we, and two other school companies that intervened, filed notices of appeal and asked the district court to stay the settlement from taking effect until the appeals were decided and the district court did temporarily stay any loan discharges and refunds under the settlement pending the decision.  Plaintiffs and the DOE thereafter filed oppositions to our stay request and, after a hearing, the district court denied our stay request, but extended the temporary stay of loan discharges and refunds associated with the three school companies for seven days to allow us to file a motion for a stay with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On February 27, 2023, we and the two other school companies that appealed filed a joint motion for a stay with the Ninth Circuit which we expect the plaintiffs and the DOE will oppose.  We expect that the Ninth Circuit will decide our stay motion in the coming weeks.
 
 Regardless of the outcome of our stay request, we intend to ask the Ninth Circuit to overturn the district court’s judgment approving the final settlement. If the settlement agreement is upheld on appeal, or if the courts deny our stay requests, the DOE is expected to automatically approve all of the pending borrower defense applications concerning us that were submitted to the DOE on or before June 22, 2022 and to provide such automatic approval without evaluating or accounting for any of the legal or factual grounds that we provided for contesting the applications that were provided to us. The DOE may or may not attempt to seek recoupment from applicable schools relating to approval of borrower defense applications.  If the DOE approves borrower defense applications concerning us and attempts to recoup from us the loan amounts in the approved applications, we would consider our options for challenging the legal and factual bases for such actions.  The settlement also requires the DOE to review borrower defense applications submitted after June 22, 2022 and before November 16, 2022 within 36 months of the final settlement date.  If the DOE grants some or all of these applications, the DOE also could attempt to recoup from us the loan amounts relating to these applications as well. We cannot predict whether the settlement will be upheld on appeal, what actions the DOE might take if the settlement is upheld on appeal (including the ultimate timing or amount of borrower defense applications the DOE may grant in the future and the timing or amount of any possible liabilities that the DOE may seek to recover from the Company, if any), or what the outcome of our challenges to such actions will be, but such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The "90/10 Rule."   Under the HEA, a proprietary institution that derives more than 90% of its total revenue from Title IV Programs (its “90/10 Rule percentage”) for two consecutive fiscal years becomes immediately ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs and may not reapply for eligibility until the end of at least two fiscal years. An institution with revenues exceeding 90% for a single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures, including a potential requirement to submit a letter of credit.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”  If an institution violated the 90/10 Rule and became ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continued to disburse Title IV Program funds, the DOE would require the institution to repay all Title IV Program funds received by the institution after the effective date of the loss of eligibility. A loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for any of our institutions would have a significant impact on the rate at which our students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations.
 
 We have calculated that for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 our institutions’ 90/10 Rule percentages ranged from 72% to 79%.  For fiscal year 2022, none of our existing institutions derived more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV Programs.  Our calculations are subject to review by the DOE.


In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) was signed into law.  Among other provisions, the ARPA includes a provision that amends the 90/10 Rule by treating other “federal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution” in the same way as Title IV Program funds are currently treated in the 90/10 Rule calculation. This means that our institutions will be required to limit the combined amount of Title IV Program funds and applicable “federal funds” revenue in a fiscal year to no more than 90% in a fiscal year as calculated under the rule. Consequently, the ARPA change to the 90/10 Rule is expected to increase the 90/10 Rule calculations at our institutions. The ARPA does not identify the specific federal funding programs that will be covered by this provision, but it is expected to include funding from federal student aid programs such as the veterans’ benefits programs, which include the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Veterans Readiness and Employment services, from which we derived approximately 74% of our revenues on a cash basis in fiscal year 2022.
 
The ARPA states that the amendments to the 90/10 Rule apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and are subject to the HEA’s negotiated rulemaking process. Accordingly, the ARPA change to the 90/10 Rule is not expected to apply to our 90/10 Rule calculations until 2024 relating to our fiscal year ended 2023. Beginning in January 2022, the DOE convened negotiated rulemaking committee meetings on a variety of topics including the 90/10 Rule.  The committee reached consensus on proposed 90/10 Rule regulations during meetings in March 2022.  On July 28, 2022, the DOE published proposed regulations regarding the 90/10 Rule among other topics.  The DOE published final regulations on October 28, 2022 with a general effective date of July 1, 2023.
 
The new 90/10 Rule regulations contain several new and amended provisions on a variety of topics including, among other things, confirming that the rules apply to fiscal years ending on or after January 1, 2023; noting that the DOE plans to identify the types of federal funds to be included in the 90/10 Rule in a notice in the Federal Register (which the DOE subsequently confirmed in a published notice on December 21, 2022 includes a wide range of Federal student aid programs including VA and DOD programs); requiring institutions to disburse funds that students are eligible to receive for a fiscal year before the end of the fiscal year rather than delaying disbursements until a subsequent fiscal year; updating requirements for counting revenues generated from certain educational activities associated with institutional programs, from certain non-Title IV eligible educational programs, and from institutional aid programs such as institutional loans, scholarships, and income share agreements; updating technical rules for the 90/10 Rule calculation; including rules for sanctions for noncompliance with the 90/10 Rule and for required notifications to students and the DOE by the institution of noncompliance with the 90/10 Rule.  The new regulations under the 90/10 Rule could have a material adverse effect on us and other schools like ours.
 
 We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new 90/10 Rule regulations on our business.  We anticipate making changes to our operations in order to address the provisions in the 90/10 Rule and in order to maintain the 90/10 Rule percentages at our institutions below the 90% threshold as calculated under DOE regulations. However, we do not have significant control over the amount of Title IV Program funds that our students may receive and borrow. Our institutions’ 90/10 Rule percentages can be increased by increases in Title IV Programs aid availability (including, for example, increases in Pell Grant funds) and can be decreased by decreases in the availability of state grant program funding and other sources of student aid that do not count as Title IV Programs funds in the 90/10 Rule calculation. Our institutions’ 90/10 Rule percentages also will increase when the ARPA amendments to the 90/10 Rule take effect to the extent that students eligible to receive military and veteran education assistance enroll and use their financial assistance at our institutions. We cannot be certain that the changes we make in the future will succeed in maintaining our institutions’ 90/10 Rule percentages below the required levels or that the changes will not materially impact our business operations, revenues, and operating costs.  It also is possible that Congress or the DOE could amend the 90/10 Rule in the future to lower the 90% threshold, change the calculation methodology, or make other changes to the 90/10 Rule that could make it more difficult for our institutions to comply with the 90/10 Rule.


As noted above, if any of our institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, that loss would also adversely affect our students’ access to various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, and would have a significant impact on the rate at which our students enroll in our programs and on our business and results of operations.

Student Loan Defaults.  The HEA limits participation in Title IV Programs by institutions whose former students defaulted on the repayment of federally guaranteed or funded student loans above a prescribed rate (the “cohort default rate”).  The DOE calculates these rates based on the number of students who have defaulted, not the dollar amount of such defaults.  The cohort default rate is calculated on a federal fiscal year basis and measures the percentage of students who enter repayment of a loan during the federal fiscal year and default on the loan on or before the end of the federal fiscal year or the subsequent two federal fiscal years.
 
Under the HEA, an institution whose Federal Family Education Loan, or FFEL, and Federal Direct Loan, or FDL, cohort default rate is 30% or greater for three consecutive federal fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in the FFEL, FDL, and Pell programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the DOE determines that such institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years.  An institution whose FFEL and FDL cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year exceeds 40% loses its eligibility to participate in the FFEL and FDL programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the DOE determines that such institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years.  If an institution’s three-year cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% in two of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which the DOE has issued cohort default rates, the institution may be placed on provisional certification status and could be required to submit a letter of credit to the DOE.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”
 
In September 2022, the DOE released the final cohort default rates for the 2019 federal fiscal year.  These are the most recent final rates published by the DOE.  The rates for our existing institutions for the 2019 federal fiscal year range from 1.9% to 2.9 %.  None of our institutions had a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 30% for the 2019 federal fiscal year.
 
 In February 2023, the DOE released draft three-year cohort default rates for the 2020 federal fiscal year.  The draft cohort default rates are subject to change pending receipt of the final cohort default rates, which the DOE is expected to publish in September 2023.  The draft rates for our institutions for the 2020 federal fiscal year were 0%. 


Financial Responsibility Standards.
 
All institutions participating in Title IV Programs must satisfy specific standards of financial responsibility. The DOE evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards each year, based on the institution's annual audited financial statements, as well as following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control of the institution.
 
The most significant financial responsibility measurement is the institution's composite score, which is calculated by the DOE based on three ratios:
 
   
• | the equity ratio, which measures the institution's capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution's ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the net income ratio, which measures the institution's ability to operate at a profit.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DOE assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The DOE then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further oversight.
 
If an institution's composite score is below 1.5, but is at least 1.0, it is in a category denominated by the DOE as "the zone." Under the DOE regulations, institutions that are in the zone typically may be permitted by the DOE to continue to participate in the Title IV Programs by choosing one of two alternatives:  1) the “Zone Alternative” under which an institution is required to make disbursements to students under the Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (“HCM1”) payment method, or a different payment method other than the advance payment method, and to notify the DOE within 10 days after the occurrence of certain oversight and financial events or 2) submit a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 50 percent of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recent fiscal year.  The DOE permits an institution to participate under the “Zone Alternative” for a period of up to three consecutive fiscal years.  Under the HCM1 payment method, the institution is required to make Title IV Program disbursements to eligible students and parents before it requests or receives funds for the amount of those disbursements from the DOE.  As long as the student accounts are credited before the funding requests are initiated, an institution is permitted to draw down funds through the DOE’s electronic system for grants management and payments for the amount of disbursements made to eligible students.  Unlike the Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (“HCM2”) and the reimbursement payment methods, the HCM1 payment method typically does not require schools to submit documentation to the DOE and wait for DOE approval before drawing down Title IV Program funds.  Effective July 1, 2016, a school under HCM1, HCM2 or reimbursement payment methods must also pay any credit balances due to a student before drawing down funds for the amount of those disbursements from the DOE, even if the student or parent provides written authorization for the school to hold the credit balance.
 
If an institution's composite score is below 1.0, the institution is considered by the DOE to lack financial responsibility. If the DOE determines that an institution does not satisfy the DOE's financial responsibility standards, depending on its composite score and other factors, that institution may establish its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs on an alternative basis by, among other things:
    
• | posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by the institution during the institution's most recently completed fiscal year; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year accepting provisional certification; complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than the DOE's standard advance funding arrangement. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Index
For the 2022, 2021, and 2020 fiscal years, we calculated our composite score to be 2.9, 3.0, and 2.7, respectively. These scores are subject to determination by the DOE based on its review of our consolidated audited financial statements for the 2022, 2021, and 2020 fiscal years, but we believe it is likely that the DOE will determine that our institutions comply with the composite score requirement.
On September 23, 2019, the DOE published final regulations with a general effective date of July 1, 2020, that, among other things, modified the list of triggering events that could result in the DOE determining that an institution lacks financial responsibility and must submit to the DOE a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and accept other conditions on the institution’s Title IV Program eligibility.  The regulations create lists of mandatory triggering events and discretionary triggering events.  An institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if a mandatory triggering event occurs.  The mandatory triggering events include:

• | the institution’s recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 as determined by the DOE as a result of an institutional liability from a settlement, final judgment, or final determination in an administrative or judicial action or proceeding brought by a federal or state entity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the institution’s recalculated composite score goes from less than 1.5 to less than 1.0 as determined by the DOE as a result of a withdrawal of owner’s equity from the institution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the SEC takes certain actions against the institution or the institution fails to comply with certain filing requirements; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the occurrence of two or more discretionary triggering events (as described below) within a certain time period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DOE also may determine that an institution lacks financial responsibility if one of the following discretionary triggering events occurs and the event is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution:
 

• | a show cause or similar order from the institution’s accrediting agency that could result in the withdrawal, revocation or suspension of institutional accreditation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a notice from the institution’s state licensing agency of an intent to withdraw or terminate the institution’s state licensure if the institution does not take steps to comply with state requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a default, delinquency, or other event occurs as a result of an institutional violation of a security or loan agreement that enables the creditor to require an increase in collateral, a change in contractual obligations, an increase in interest rates or payment, or other sanctions, penalties or fees; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a failure to comply with the 90/10 Rule during the institution’s most recently completed fiscal year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high annual drop-out rates from the institution as determined by the DOE; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | official cohort default rates of at least 30 percent for the two most recent years unless a pending appeal could sufficiently reduce one of the rates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The regulations require the institution to notify the DOE of the occurrence of a mandatory or discretionary triggering event and to provide certain information to the DOE to demonstrate why the event does not establish the institution’s lack of financial responsibility or require the submission of a letter of credit or imposition of other requirements.
 
The expanded financial responsibility regulations could result in the DOE recalculating and reducing our composite score to account for DOE estimates of potential losses under one or more of the extensive list of triggering circumstances and also could result in the imposition of conditions and requirements, including a requirement to provide a letter of credit or other form of financial protection.
 
As noted above, the DOE previously initiated a negotiated rulemaking process in January 2022 that was considering new regulations on a variety of topics including financial responsibility.  After announcing a delay in the process in June 2022, the DOE announced in January 2023 its intent to publish proposed rules on this subject in April 2023. The regulations typically would take effect on July 1, 2024 if the DOE publishes the final regulations by November 1, 2023.  The DOE is considering proposals that, among other things, would expand the list and scope of triggering events and other circumstances that could result in the DOE determining that the institution lacks financial responsibility and must submit to the DOE a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and accept other conditions on the institution’s Title IV Program eligibility.  The implementation of new financial responsibility regulations could increase the likelihood of the DOE requiring the posting of a letter of credit and imposing other conditions upon our schools.
 
Return of Title IV Program Funds.  An institution participating in Title IV Programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing them, and must return those unearned funds to the DOE or the applicable lending institution in a timely manner, which is generally within 45 days from the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn.
   Index
If an institution is cited in an audit or program review for returning Title IV Program funds late for 5% or more of the students in the audit or program review sample, or if the regulatory auditor identifies a material weakness in the institution’s report on internal controls relating to the return of unearned Title IV Program funds, the institution may be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE in an amount equal to 25% of the total amount of Title IV Program funds that should have been returned for students who withdrew in the institution's prior fiscal year.
 
On January 11, 2018, the DOE sent letters to our then existing Columbia, Maryland and Iselin, New Jersey institutions requiring each institution to submit a letter of credit to the DOE based on findings of late returns of Title IV Program funds in the annual Title IV Program compliance audits submitted to the DOE for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  Accordingly, we submitted letters of credit in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.1 million to the DOE by the February 23, 2018, deadline and we continue to comply with the letter of credit requirement.  By letter dated February 16, 2021, the DOE notified us that our Columbia and Iselin institutions failed to comply with the refund requirements based on their 2017, 2018, and 2019 audits.  Consequently, the DOE has required us to maintain with the DOE a letter of credit in the amount of $600,020.  The expiration date of this letter of credit has been extended until January 31, 2024.
 
More recently, as noted above, the DOE announced its intention to commence a negotiated rulemaking process in April 2023 on a number of topics including plans to amend the regulations on the requirements for institutions to return unearned Title IV funds to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing them.
 
 Negotiated Rulemaking.  The DOE periodically issues new regulations and guidance that can have an adverse effect on our institutions. The negotiated rulemaking process typically begins with the DOE convening a negotiated rulemaking committee with various representatives of the higher education community to help develop and attempt to reach consensus on proposed regulations on the various topics.  The DOE follows up by publishing proposed regulations in the Federal Register for notice and comment by the public.  The DOE typically concludes the process by finalizing and publishing final regulations in the Federal Register. The DOE initiated two additional negotiated rulemaking processes in 2021 and 2022, respectively.  The first of the two negotiated rulemaking sessions led to final regulations published on November 1, 2022 regarding Borrower Defense to Repayment (including, among other things, potential expanded limitations on recruitment tactics and conduct that are deemed to be aggressive or deceptive), the return of prohibitions on pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers, closed school loan discharges (including the reinstatement of automatic closed school loan discharges), total and permanent disability discharges, public student loan forgiveness, income driven repayment, interest capitalization, false certification discharges, and prison exchange programs. See “Business – Regulatory Environment - Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations.”


 The DOE also published final regulations on October 28, 2022 on topics including amendments to the 90/10 Rule, amendments to the rules regarding changes in ownership and control, and amendments to the regulations for Federal Pell Grants for prison education programs.  The regulations have a general effective date of July 1, 2023, with the new 90/10 Rule amendments designated to apply to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.  See “Business – Regulatory Environment – 90/10 Rule” and “Business- Regulatory Environment – Change of Control.”
 
The DOE initiated rulemaking on several other topics in January 2022 and, after delaying the process in June 2022, announced its intention in January 2023 to reinitiate the rulemaking process with the planned publication of proposed regulations in April 2023 on topics including, for example, gainful employment, financial responsibility, administrative capability, certification procedures, ability to benefit, and improving income driven repayment of loans.  See “Business – Regulatory Environment – Gainful Employment.”
 
As previously noted above, the DOE also announced in January 2023 its intention to initiate a new negotiated rulemaking process in April 2023 on several topics including, for example, amending regulations on state authorization as a component of institutional eligibility, amending regulations on accreditation including standards for the DOE’s recognition of accrediting agencies and accreditation procedures as a component of institutional eligibility for Title IV Programs, amending regulations on the requirements for institutions to return unearned Title IV Program funds for students who withdraw without completing their educational programs, amending the cash management regulations to ensure that students have and maintain timely access to student aid disbursed by their institutions, amending regulations on third-party servicers, and amending the definition of distance education.  See “Business – Regulatory Environment – State Authorization.”  If the DOE publishes final regulations by November 1, 2023, the regulations typically would have a general effective date of July 1, 2024.  If they are published after November 1, 2023, the regulations typically would have a general effective date of July 1, 2025 or a later date.  We cannot predict the ultimate timing, content, and impact of the proposed and final regulations on all of these topics.  Some of the new and proposed regulations are expected to impose a broad range of additional requirements on institutions and especially on for-profit institutions like our schools.  In turn, the new and proposed regulations are likely to increase the possibility that our schools could be subject to additional reporting requirements, to potential liabilities and sanctions such as letter of credit amounts, and to potential loss of Title IV eligibility if our efforts to modify our operations to comply with the new regulations are unsuccessful.
 


   Index
Substantial Misrepresentation.  The DOE’s regulations prohibit an institution that participates in Title IV Programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges, graduate employability or its relationship with the DOE. A “misrepresentation” includes any false, erroneous, or misleading statement (whether made in writing, visually, orally, or through other means) that is made by an eligible institution, by one of its representatives, or by a third party that provides to the institution educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services and that is made to a student, prospective student, any member of the public, an accrediting or state agency, or to DOE.  The DOE defines a “substantial misrepresentation” to include any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment. The definition of “substantial misrepresentation” is broad and, therefore, it is possible that a statement made by the institution or one of its service providers or representatives could be construed by the DOE to constitute a substantial misrepresentation. If the DOE determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the DOE may impose sanctions or other conditions upon the institution including, but not limited to, initiating an action to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs and may seek to discharge students’ loans and impose liabilities upon the institution. The DOE published final regulations on November 1, 2022 on a variety of topics including, amended and expanded regulations on substantial misrepresentations.  Specifically, the new regulations expand the types of conduct that could result in a discharge of student loans including:  1) an expanded list of substantial misrepresentations; 2) a new section regarding substantial omissions of fact; 3) breaches of contract; 4) a new section regarding aggressive and deceptive recruitment; or 5) state or federal judgments or final DOE actions that could result in a borrower defense claim.  Some of these forms of conduct also could result in further scrutiny of marketing and recruiting practices by institutions like our schools and could increase the chances of the DOE finding practices to be noncompliant and imposing sanctions based on the alleged noncompliance up to and including fines and potential loss of Title IV eligibility.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Borrower Defense to Repayment Regulations.”
 
 In March 2022, the DOE published guidance about the enforcement of the requirements regarding substantial misrepresentations.  The DOE indicated that it is monitoring complaints and Borrower Defense to Repayment applications from veterans, service members, and their family members who report that personnel and representatives of postsecondary schools suggested during the enrollment process that their military education benefits would cover all of the costs of their program but were told subsequently they would have to take out student loans to finish the program.  The DOE stated that it would ensure that institutions engaging in misrepresentations are held accountable if they cause a student to incur extra costs unwittingly or without a full understanding of the implications of borrowing.  The DOE also indicated that such students could be entitled to discharge of their student loans and that it would share information and complaints about military-connected students with the DOD and VA for potential agency action. 


School Acquisitions/Change of Control.  When a company acquires a school that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, that school undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a “change of control” as defined by the DOE. Upon such a change of control, a school's eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs is generally suspended until it has applied for recertification by the DOE as an eligible school under its new ownership, which requires that the school also re-establish its state authorization and accreditation.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business – Regulatory Environment – School Acquisitions.”  Thus, any plans to expand our business through acquisition of additional schools and have them certified by the DOE to participate in Title IV Programs must take into account the approval requirements of the DOE and the relevant state education agencies and accrediting commissions.  The DOE has recently published final regulations with a general effective date of July 1, 2023 concerning change of control.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of these new regulations on our business, but the regulations, among other things, expand the requirements applicable to school acquisitions in ways that could make it more difficult to acquire additional schools. See Part I, Item 1. “Business – Regulatory Environment – Negotiated Rulemaking.”
 
In addition to school acquisitions, other types of transactions can also cause a change of control. The DOE, most state education agencies and our accrediting commissions have standards pertaining to the change of control of schools, but these standards are not uniform. DOE regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution's parent corporation. For a publicly traded corporation, DOE regulations provide that a change of control occurs in one of two ways: (a) if a person acquires ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing the change of control or (b) if the corporation has a shareholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest shareholder of the corporation, and that shareholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest shareholder.  These standards are subject to interpretation by the DOE.   A significant purchase or disposition of our Common Stock could be determined by the DOE to be a change of control under this standard.
 
Most of the states and our accrediting commissions include the sale of a controlling interest of Common Stock in the definition of a change of control although some agencies could determine that the sale or disposition of a smaller interest would result in a change of control. A change of control under the definition of one of these agencies would require the affected school to reaffirm its state authorization or accreditation. Some agencies would require approval prior to a sale or disposition that would result in a change of control in order to maintain authorization or accreditation.  The requirements to obtain such reaffirmation from the states and our accrediting commissions vary widely.
 
 Most of the states and our accrediting commissions include the sale of a controlling interest of Common Stock in the definition of a change of control although some agencies could determine that the sale or disposition of a smaller interest would result in a change of control. A change of control under the definition of one of these agencies would require the affected school to reaffirm its state authorization or accreditation. Some agencies would require approval prior to a sale or disposition that would result in a change of control in order to maintain authorization or accreditation.  The requirements to obtain such reaffirmation from the states and our accrediting commissions vary widely.

A change of control could occur as a result of future transactions in which the Company or our schools are involved. Some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the board of directors of the Company are examples of such transactions. Moreover, the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our shareholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. In addition, the adverse regulatory effect of a change of control also could discourage bids for shares of our Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.  As noted above, the DOE published final regulations on October 28, 2022 relating to change of control with a general effective date of July 1, 2023.   See Part I, Item 1. “Business – Regulatory Environment – Negotiated Rulemaking.”

Opening Additional Schools and Adding Educational Programs.  For-profit educational institutions must be authorized by their state education agencies and be fully operational for two years before applying to the DOE to participate in Title IV Programs. However, an institution that is certified to participate in Title IV Programs may establish an additional location and apply to participate in Title IV
 
Programs at that location without reference to the two-year requirement, if such additional location satisfies all other applicable DOE eligibility requirements. Our strategic plans for future expansion are based, in part, on our ability to open new schools as additional locations of our existing institutions and take into account the DOE’s approval requirements.
    A student may use Title IV Program funds only to pay the costs associated with enrollment in an eligible educational program offered by an institution participating in Title IV Programs. Generally, unless otherwise required by the DOE or by DOE regulations, an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs may add a new educational program without DOE approval. However, institutions that are provisionally certified may be required to obtain approval of new educational programs.   Our Indianapolis, New Britain, and Columbia institutions are provisionally certified and required to obtain prior DOE approval of new locations and of new educational programs.  If an institution erroneously determines that an educational program is eligible for purposes of Title IV Programs, the institution would likely be liable for repayment of Title IV Program funds provided to students in that educational program. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to add new educational programs at our existing schools.
 
Some of the state education agencies and our accrediting commission also have requirements that may affect our schools' ability to open a new campus, establish an additional location of an existing institution or begin offering a new educational program.  The DOE has initiated a negotiated rulemaking process that may result in new rules that, among other things, may further restrict the ability of some schools – such as schools that are provisionally certified – to add new locations or educational programs, which could impact our ability to make such changes if we are provisionally certified or subject to other criteria in the regulations that ultimately are adopted.  The rulemaking process is ongoing.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business – Regulatory Environment – Negotiated Rulemaking.”
 
Closed School Loan Discharges. The DOE may grant closed school loan discharges of federal student loans based upon applications by qualified students. The DOE also may initiate discharges on its own for students who have not reenrolled in another Title IV Program eligible school within three years after the closure and who attended campuses that closed on or after November 1, 2013, as did some of our former campuses. If the DOE discharges some or all of these loans, the DOE may seek to recover the cost of the loan discharges from us. As noted above, the DOE published final regulations on November 1, 2022 with a general effective date of July 1, 2023 on a variety of topics, including closed school loan discharges (and, among other things, the reintroduction of automatic closed school loan discharges), which will make it easier for borrowers to obtain discharges of their loans and for the DOE to recover liabilities from institutions.
 
 We cannot predict any additional closed school loan discharges that the DOE may approve or the liabilities that the DOE may seek from us for campuses that have closed in the past or any possible school closures in the future.


Administrative Capability.  The DOE assesses the administrative capability of each institution that participates in Title IV Programs under a series of separate standards. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead the DOE to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation. These criteria require, among other things, that the institution:

• | comply with all applicable federal student financial aid requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student Title IV Programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | administer Title IV Programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls over financial reporting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | divide the function of authorizing and disbursing or delivering Title IV Program funds so that no office has the responsibility for both functions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish and maintain records required under the Title IV Program regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepancies in information from sources regarding a student’s application for financial aid under the Title IV Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refer to the Office of the Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee, third party servicer or other agent of the school has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV Programs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide adequate financial aid counseling to its students;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the Title IV Program regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

   Index
The DOE has placed three of our institutions on provisional certification based on findings in recent audits of the institutions’ Title IV compliance that the DOE alleges identified deficiencies in regulations related to DOE regulations regarding an institution’s level of administrative capability.  See Part I. Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.”  Failure by us to satisfy any of these or other administrative capability criteria could cause our institutions to be subject to sanctions or other actions by the DOE or to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, which would have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.
 
The DOE previously initiated a negotiated rulemaking process in January 2022 that was considering, among other issues, the expansion of the scope of the administrative capability regulations to include other requirements (such as, for example, providing adequate career services and refraining from misrepresentations and certain types of recruiting practices).  After announcing a delay in this process in June 2022, the DOE announced in January 2023 its intention to publish proposed rules in April 2023 amending regulations on institution and program eligibility, including the administrative capability regulations.
 
Restrictions on Payment of Commissions, Bonuses and Other Incentive Payments.  An institution participating in Title IV Programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. The DOE’s regulations established 12 “safe harbors” identifying types of compensation that may be paid without violating the incentive compensation rule.  On October 29, 2010, the DOE adopted final rules that took effect on July 1, 2011 and amended the incentive compensation rule by, among other things, eliminating the 12 safe harbors (thereby reducing the scope of permissible compensatory payments under the rule) and expanding the scope of compensatory payments and employees subject to the rule.  We cannot predict how the DOE will interpret and enforce the revised incentive compensation rule and the limited published guidance that the DOE has provided, nor how it will apply the rule and guidance to our past, present, and future compensation practices.  The implementation of the final regulations required us to change our compensation practices and has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the productivity of our employees, on the retention of our employees and on our business and results of operations.
 
Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations. Our schools are subject to audits, program reviews, site visits, and other reviews by various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the DOE, the DOE’s Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), state education agencies and other state regulators, the VA and other federal agencies (such as, for example, the FTC or the CFPB), and by our accrediting commissions. In addition, each of our institutions must retain an independent certified public accountant to conduct an annual compliance audit of the institution’s administration of Title IV Program funds. The institution must submit the resulting annual compliance audit report to the DOE for review.  The annual compliance audit reports for our institutions contain findings on topics that were the subject of findings in prior audits although the amount of questioned funds in the reports are immaterial and have been repaid.  The reoccurrence of findings in our compliance audit reports could result in the DOE initiating an adverse action against one or more of our institutions.  Significant violations of Title IV Program requirements by any of our institutions could become the basis for the DOE to impose liabilities on us or initiate an adverse action to limit, suspend, terminate, revoke, or decline to renew the participation of the affected institution in Title IV Programs or to seek civil or criminal penalties. Generally, a termination of Title IV Program eligibility extends for 18 months before the institution may apply for reinstatement of its participation. Some of the findings in the annual Title IV Program compliance audits for some of our institutions resulted in the DOE placing those institutions on provisional certification.  See Part I. Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs.”
 
If one of our schools fails to comply with accrediting or state licensing requirements, such school and its main and/or branch campuses could be subject to the loss of state licensure or accreditation, which in turn could result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. If the DOE or another agency determined that one of our institutions improperly disbursed Title IV Program funds or violated a provision of the HEA or DOE regulations, the institution could be required to repay such funds and related costs to the DOE and lenders, and could be assessed an administrative fine. The DOE could also place the institution on provisional certification status and/or transfer the institution to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of receiving Title IV Program funds, under which an institution must disburse its own funds to students and document the students' eligibility for Title IV Program funds before receiving such funds from the DOE.  See Part I, Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Financial Responsibility Standards.”
 
Consumer Protection Laws and Scrutiny of the For-Profit Postsecondary Education Sector.  As a post-secondary educational institution, we are subject to a broad range of consumer protection and other laws, such as recruiting, marketing, the protection of personal information, student financing and payment servicing, enforced by federal agencies such as the FTC and CFPB and various state agencies and state attorneys general. We devote significant effort to complying with state and federal consumer protection laws.  In recent years, Congress, the DOE, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, the CFPB, the FTC, state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and other inquiries have occurred regarding various aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution’s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports have been issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities.

On October 6, 2021, the FTC issued an announcement regarding its intentions to target false claims by for-profit colleges on topics such as promises about graduates’ job and earnings prospects and other outcomes, to impose “significant financial penalties” on violators, and to monitor the market carefully with federal and state partners. The FTC indicated in the announcement that it had put 70 for-profit higher education institutions on notice that the agency would be “cracking down” on any such false promises. All of our institutions were among the 70 institutions who received this notice. Although the FTC stated that a school’s presence on the list of 70 institutions does not reflect any assessment as to whether they have engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct, the FTC’s announcement and its issuance of notices to schools could lead to further scrutiny, investigations, and potential attempted enforcement actions by the FTC and other regulators against for-profit schools, including our schools.
 
 On October 8, 2021, the DOE announced the establishment of an Office of Enforcement within the Federal Student Aid Office that oversees institutions participating in Title IV programs. The office will be comprised of four existing divisions, including the Administrative Actions and Appeals Services Group (which, among other things, initiates adverse actions against institutions), the Borrower Defense Group (which analyzes Borrower Defense to Repayment claims), the Investigations Group (which evaluates and investigates potential institutional noncompliance and collaborates with other federal and state regulators), and the Resolution and Referral Management Group (which tracks and resolves referrals, allegations and complaints about institutions and other parties that participate in the Title IV programs). The establishment of the Office of Enforcement could result in an increase in enforcement actions and other activities against for-profit schools and school companies, including us.


In addition to Title IV Programs and other government-administered programs, all of our schools offer extended financing programs to their students.  This extension of credit helps fill the gap between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and what the student may need to cover the full cost of his or her education. Students or their parents can apply to a number of different lenders for this funding at current market interest rates.  In such regard, we are required to comply with applicable federal and state laws related to certain consumer and educational loans and credit extensions, which may be subject to the supervisory authority of the CFPB.
 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”).  On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which includes a $2 trillion federal economic relief package providing financial assistance and other relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the spread of COVID-19.  The CARES Act includes provisions for financial assistance and other regulatory relief benefitting students and their postsecondary institutions.
  
Among other things, the CARES Act includes $14 billion of HEERF funds for the DOE to distribute directly to institutions of higher education.  Institutions are required to use at least half of the HEERF funds for emergency grants to students for expenses related to disruptions in campus operations (e.g., food, housing, etc.).  Institutions are permitted to use the remainder of the funds for additional emergency grants to students or to cover institutional costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to the COVID-19 emergency, provided that those costs do not include payments to contractors for the provision of pre-enrollment recruitment activities, endowments, or capital outlays associated with facilities related to athletics, sectarian instruction, or religious worship.  The law requires institutions receiving funds to continue to the greatest extent practicable to pay their employees and contractors during the period of any disruptions or closures related to the COVID-19 emergency.
 
The DOE has allocated funds to each institution of higher education based on a formula contained in the CARES Act. The formula is heavily weighted toward institutions with large numbers of Pell Grant recipients. The DOE allocated $27.4 million to our schools distributed in two equal installments and required them to be utilized by April 30, 2021 and May 14, 2021, respectively. The Company has distributed the full $13.7 million of its first installment as emergency grants to students and has utilized the full $13.7 million of its second installment. If the funds are not spent or accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements, we could be required to return funds or be subject to other sanctions.   See Part I. Item 1. “Business - Regulatory Environment – Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations.”
 
Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CRRSAA”) and ARPA.  On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law.  This annual appropriations bill contained the CRRSAA. which provided an additional $81.9 billion to the Education Stabilization Fund including $22.7 billion for the HEERF, which were originally created by the CARES Act in March 2020.  The higher education provisions of the CRRSAA are intended in part to provide additional financial assistance benefitting students and their postsecondary institutions in the wake of the spread of COVID-19 across the country and its impact on higher educational institutions.  In March 2021, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) was signed into law. Among other things, the ARPA provides $40 billion in relief funds that will go directly to colleges and universities with $395.8 million going to for-profit institutions.  The DOE has allocated a total of $24.4 million to our schools from the funds made available under CRRSAA and ARPA.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company has drawn down and distributed to our students $14.8 million of these allocated funds.  The remainder of the funds are on hold by the DOE and we are not expecting to receive any of those funds.  Failure to comply with requirements for the usage and reporting of these funds could result in requirements to repay some or all of the allocated funds and in other sanctions.
