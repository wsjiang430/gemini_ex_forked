Business Overview
 
We are a development-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing and eventually commercializing our proprietary immunotherapy platform technology. Our lead immunotherapy product candidate, MIE-101, is based on a naturally occurring plant virus known as Cowpea mosaic virus (or CPMV) which is believed to be non-infectious in humans and animals. However, because of its virus structure and genetic composition, CPMV elicits a strong immune response when delivered directly into tumors as shown in our preclinical studies. Data from numerous mouse cancer models and in companion dogs with naturally occurring tumors show the ability of intratumoral administration of CPMV to result in anti-tumor effects in treated tumors and systemically at other sites of disease through immune activation.
 
A growing body of published peer-reviewed data further support that the CPMV anti-tumor effects are mediated through several innate immune system pattern recognition receptors (“PRRs”) that are conserved across species and have evolved to recognize foreign pathogens such as viruses and other infectious agents. Once the innate immune system is activated by MIE-101, immune cells capable of killing the tumor are recruited and directed to the tumor resulting in an anti-cancer immune response which is enhanced because CPMV can activate through multiple PRR pathways resulting in an amplification of immune activation. The Company believes that the data generated to date support advancing the development of MIE-101 into additional studies in companion animals as well as human clinical trials.
 
Development Programs
 
Our lead immuno-oncology candidate, MIE-101, resulted from years of research by our scientific co-founders that was supported by numerous grants from federal and private funding agencies. Published preclinical data from our co-founders’ studies and ongoing research support the potential anti-cancer activity of MIE-101 as a monotherapy. In addition, preclinical data generated further support the potential of MIE-101 to improve anti-tumor effects of standard cancer treatments including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and checkpoint inhibitors. These studies include data from multiple preclinical tumor models, veterinary studies in companion animals with naturally occurring cancer, as well as showing the potential to activate human immune effector cells in vitro. MIE-101 is currently in late-stage preclinical development and our goal is to advance MIE-101 into veterinary studies and into Phase I clinical trials within 18 to 24 months from the date we are able to raise sufficient funding.
Technology Overview
 
MIE-101 is a nanoparticle-based treatment candidate derived from CPMV. The product is injected directly into a tumor and can act as an in situ vaccine using markers of the injected tumor as the target which results in the activation of a robust immune response against the primary tumor and to prime systemic anti-tumor immunity, while reversing immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment (“TME”). Although plant viruses and their nanoparticle formulations, such as MIE-101, are believed to be non-infectious toward mammals, their repetitive proteinaceous nature renders them highly visible to the immune system. The structure of MIE-101 includes repetitive, multivalent coat protein assemblies known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (“PAMP”) that have been shown to activate the innate immune system through PRR binding on innate immune cells. MIE-101 is recognized by multiple PRR pathways, thus priming the innate immune system with high potency. Activation of innate immune cells within the TME leads to secretion of key cytokines involved in immunity mediated by T helper cells termed Th1 cells. Activated M1-type macrophages and N1-type neutrophils, as well as natural killer cells lead to tumor cell killing and subsequent antigen processing leading to adaptive anti-tumor immunity. Preclinical data show that MIE-101 treatment can lead to long-lasting immune memory, which may provide protection from recurrence of the disease. MIE-101 has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in mouse models of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. Published data from studies in companion dogs with melanoma, sarcoma, and breast cancer indicate that the potent anti-tumor efficacy of MIE-101 can be replicated in naturally occurring cancer in canines.

Business Strategy
 
Our strategy is to leverage our considerable industry experience, understanding of immunotherapies, and development expertise to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates with significant market potential that can fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of cancer. We have assembled a management team along with both scientific and business advisors, including recognized experts in the field of immunotherapy, with significant industry and regulatory experience to lead and execute the development and commercialization of MIE-101 as our lead program.
 
Our initial plans are to file an investigational new drug (“IND”) application within 18 to 24 months from the date we are able to raise sufficient funding to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and early activity of for MIE-101 as an IT injection in patients with accessible tumors, such as breast cancer, melanoma carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”), sarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma with inadequate response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The IND enabling studies, including the preclinical efficacy data already generated, as well as the GLP toxicology studies to be conducted, and a summary of the Phase I clinical trial plan, will be among the components of this key regulatory submission.
 
The regulatory pathway required to support an NDA submission will consist of conducting a full clinical development program which will take several years. We will continue to prioritize our product development activities after taking into account the financial resources we have available, market dynamics and the potential for adding value.
 
Our Corporate History and Background 
 
Private Mosaic, a Delaware corporation, was formed on March 30, 2020. On July 1, 2020, we signed a Material Transfer, Evaluation, and Exclusive Option Agreement (“License Option Agreement”) with Case Western Reserve University (“CWRU”), granting us the exclusive right to license the CPMV platform technology to treat and prevent cancer and infectious diseases in humans and for veterinary use. On May 4, 2022, we entered into the license agreement with CWRU (“License Agreement”) pursuant to our rights granted under the License Option Agreement (see Note 6 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). On August 19, 2020, Patriot Scientific Corporation (now known as Mosaic ImmunoEngineering, Inc.) and Private Mosaic entered into a reverse merger transaction, as further described below.
Reverse Merger
 
On August 19, 2020, Patriot Scientific Corporation, a corporation organized under Delaware law on March 24, 1992 (now known as Mosaic ImmunoEngineering, Inc.) and Private Mosaic entered into a stock purchase agreement (“Stock Purchase Agreement”), whereby one of the wholly owned subsidiaries of Patriot Scientific Corporation merged with and into Private Mosaic, with Private Mosaic surviving as wholly owned subsidiary of Patriot Scientific Corporation (the “Reverse Merger”). The transaction closed on August 21, 2020 (“Closing Date”) in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement.
 
On the Closing Date, Patriot Scientific Corporation acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Private Mosaic, representing 630,000 shares of its Class A common stock (“Class A Stock”) and 70,000 shares of its Class B common stock (“Class B Stock”) (collectively referred to as “Target Common Stock”). In exchange for the Target Common Stock, the holders of the Class A Stock received 630,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) and holders of the Class B Stock received 70,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Voting Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”). Each share of Series A Preferred converted into 10.194106 shares of common stock as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation. Each share of Series B Preferred converts into 11.46837 shares of common stock of the Company, possesses full voting rights, on an as-converted basis, as the common stock of the Company and contains certain anti-dilution rights, as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designation. On a fully diluted, as converted basis, the holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, in aggregate, owned 90% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company as of the Closing Date.

The Reverse Merger was treated by the Company as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). For accounting purposes, Private Mosaic was considered to have acquired PTSC as the accounting acquirer because: (i) Private Mosaic stockholders owned 90% of the combined company, on an as-converted basis, immediately following the Closing Date, (ii) Private Mosaic directors held a majority of board seats in the combined company and (iii) Private Mosaic management held all key positions in the management of the combined company. Accordingly, Private Mosaic’s historical results of operations replaced PTSC’s historical results of operations for all periods prior to the Closing Date of the Reverse Merger and, for all periods following the Closing Date of the Reverse Merger, the results of operations of the combined company are included in the Company’s financial statements.
 
Other Key Corporate Events
 
On November 30, 2020, we filed amended and restated articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (“Amended and Restated Certificate”) to change the name of the Company to Mosaic ImmunoEngineering, Inc. (“Name Change”) to align the Company’s corporate name with its new strategic direction, to implement a 1-for-500 reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”), and to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 600 million to 100 million. The Reverse Stock Split was effective on December 2, 2020. All share numbers and preferred stock conversion numbers included herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 1-for-500 Reverse Stock Split. On December 30, 2020, we changed our fiscal year end from May 31 to December 31.
 
Our funding has primarily come from the issuance of convertible notes. On May 7, 2021 and February 18, 2022, we issued unsecured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $575,000 and $341,632, respectively (see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
 
On July 6, 2022, we entered into a redemption agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”) with Holocom, Inc. (“Holocom”) pursuant to which we requested full redemption of our 2,100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $0.40 per share, provided Holocom has sufficient capital to redeem the underlying shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received cash proceeds in the amount of $343,000 upon the redemption of 857,500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our License Agreement
 
On May 4, 2022, we exercised certain of our rights under the License Option Agreement, particularly those directed to our Immuno-Oncology technology and patents, and entered into a License Agreement with CWRU. Provided we are in compliance with the underlying terms of the License Agreement, the License Agreement will remain in effect until the later of (i) twenty (20) years from the date of the License Agreement, (ii) on the expiration date of the last-to-expire patent under the License Agreement or (iii) at the expiry of all Market Exclusivity Periods for a licensed product.
 
Under the License Agreement, the following represents a summary of the main patent families that we have right to develop:
 

• | Immuno-Oncology: “Cancer Immunotherapy using Virus Particles”, with PCT Patent Applications, Publication Nos. WO 2016/073972 and WO 2018/165663, and associated U.S. patents and applications, including U.S. Patent No. 11,260,121, and foreign patents or applications in Europe, Japan, China, Canada and Australia; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Freeze Drying: “Freeze Dried Viral Nanoparticle Constructs”, including U.S. Patent No. 11,390,853. 

 
As of December 31, 2022, the aforementioned patent families included three (3) issued U.S. patents, six (6) issued or granted foreign patents and eight (8) additional pending U.S. and foreign patent applications claiming methods of treating cancer using certain plant viruses, both alone and in combination therapies, and certain methods of manufacture thereof. The Immuno-Oncology patent family covers the intratumoral administration of CPMV, including MIE-101, to treat cancer in humans and animals, both as a single-agent therapy and in combination regimens, including with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Our Immuno-Oncology patent family generally expires between November 9, 2035 and December 5, 2035, and our Freeze Drying patent expires on June 29, 2040.

Our patent strategy is to in-license and/or file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Generally, assuming all maintenance fees (annuities) are paid, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (other than a priority date for a provisional application). In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in limited cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Also, examinations are often lengthy and can involve numerous challenges to the claims sought. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States, the European Union, and other countries may diminish the value of the underlying patents under our License Agreement or narrow the scope of our patent protection.
 
Our success depends in large part on our ability and CWRU’s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States, the European Union, and other major pharmaceutical markets with respect to our proprietary technology and products under the License Agreement. We or CWRU will seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and internationally that are related to our novel technologies and product candidates. We currently heavily rely on CWRU to assist with protecting the underlying patents and patent applications under the License Agreement.
 
In addition, the patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We or CWRU may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope. It is also possible that we or CWRU will fail to identify patentable aspects of our discovery and preclinical development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents covering technology under the License Agreement. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Any inability by us or CWRU to protect adequately the underlying intellectual property covered by the License Agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.
 
Our Trade Secrets
 
We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, and there is no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that such rights can be meaningfully protected. We require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, and other advisers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreement provides that all inventions conceived by such employees shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

Third-Party Rights
 
Our success also depends in part on our ability to gain access to third-party patent and proprietary rights and to operate our business without infringing on third-party patent rights. We may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. Licenses required under third-party patents or proprietary rights may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain the required licenses, we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to redesign products or methods or we could be unable to develop, manufacture or sell products, if approved, requiring these licenses at all. The failure to obtain licenses, if needed, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulatory Compliance
 
Our planned research and development activities, including testing in laboratory animals and in humans, our manufacture of MIE-101, and oversight of suppliers and contract manufacturers involved in the production of our product candidates, as well as the design, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, handling, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing of the product candidates that we are developing, are all subject to stringent regulation, primarily by the FDA in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA") and its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act") and its implementing regulations, and by comparable authorities under similar laws and regulations in other countries. If for any reason we do not comply with applicable requirements, such noncompliance can result in various adverse consequences, including one or more delays in approval of, or even the refusal to approve, product licenses or other applications, the suspension or termination of clinical investigations, the revocation of approvals if granted, as well as fines, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions against shipping products and total or partial suspension of production and/or refusal to allow us to enter into governmental supply contracts.
Product Development and Approval Process
 
In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biologic pharmaceuticals, or biologics. The FDA's regulatory authority for the approval of biologics resides in the PHS Act. However, biologics are also subject to regulation under the FDCA because most biological products also meet the FDCA's definition of "drugs." Most pharmaceuticals or "conventional drugs" consist of pure chemical substances and their structures are known. Most biologics, however, are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. Biological products differ from conventional drugs in that they tend to be heat-sensitive and susceptible to microbial contamination, thus requiring sterile manufacturing processes. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated; 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, and its safety and efficacy for each indication;
• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a new biologic, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations; and 
• | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.

Preclinical tests assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate in animal models. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 
The clinical investigation of a pharmaceutical, including a biologic, is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
 

• | Phase I studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product. 
• | Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
• | Phase IV clinical trials may be required to as post-marketing studies to find out more about the product’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations. 

 
The FDA may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be terminated by IRBs, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing authorization.
 
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing, along with information regarding the manufacturing of the product and proposed product labeling, are evaluated and, if determined appropriate, submitted to the FDA through a BLA. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things.  Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s standard goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to a drug that treats a serious condition and would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness qualifying for Priority Review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
The FDA offers certain programs, such as Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) and Fast Track designation, designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. For BTD, preliminary clinical evidence of the product indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If BTD or Fast Track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete, and the product may be eligible for accelerated approval. However, receipt of BTD or Fast Track designation for a product candidate does not ensure that a product will be developed or approved on an expedited basis, and such designation may be rescinded if the product candidate is found to no longer meet the qualifying criteria.

The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, and applications for new molecular entities and original BLAs are generally discussed at advisory committee meetings unless the FDA determines that this type of consultation is not needed under the circumstances. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
 
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL may require additional inspections, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates being developed, and products being marketed outside of the United States. We must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA for BLA licensure. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Manufacturing
 
While our scientific collaborators have manufactured MIE-101 for preclinical research studies and companion animal studies, we have limited experience in the manufacturing of MIE-101. In addition, we currently do not possess any internal manufacturing infrastructure or capabilities, especially in the growth and manufacturing of plant viruses. We plan to rely on internal manufacturing and development capabilities, as capital resources become available and capabilities are developed, in addition to third-party contract manufacturing and development organizations, or CDMOs, to manufacture our biological product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We believe that this hybrid strategy will enable us to control and manage preclinical and early-stage clinical manufacturing while outsourcing other aspects of manufacturing and later-stage clinical manufacturing that would likely require higher infrastructure cost to build and operate. As with any supply program, obtaining pre-clinical and clinical materials of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements of our development programs cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor. To date, we have not manufactured any of our products candidates due to our limited capital resources.
Sales and Marketing
 
None of our product candidates has been approved for sale. If and when our product candidates advance closer to marketing approval, we may commercialize them on our own in the United States and potentially with pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners in other geographies. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercialization capabilities and have no experience as a company doing such activities. However, we may build the necessary capabilities and infrastructure over time following the advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the opportunity and the size of the commercial infrastructure required will influence our commercialization plans and decision making.

Competition
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and characterized by aggressive research and development and rapidly evolving science, technology, and standards of medical care throughout the world. Regarding our competitive position in the industry, our lead product, MIE-101, is in preclinical development in oncology and would face competition with all other immuno-oncology products either in development or already approved. Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future, such as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies focused on cancer immunotherapies, including but not limited to, Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi S.A., all have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, conducting preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Paradoxically, many of these companies are developing systemic immunotherapies which have the potential to be developed in combination with MIE-101 and so we view them both from a competitive and complementary perspective. Oncology drugs and therapeutics on the market range from traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4, such as BMS’ YERVOY, and PD-1/PD-L1, such as BMS’ OPDIVO, Merck & Co.’s KEYTRUDA and Genentech’s TECENTRIQ, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, such as Amgen’s BLINCYTO and to oncolytic immunotherapies, including Amgen’s T-Vec, an FDA-approved oncolytic immunotherapy for treating advanced melanoma.
 
Additionally, we view as our most direct potential competitors are companies such as Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Oncology, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (developing DSP-0509, a TLR7 agonist), Ascendis Pharma A/S (developing TransCon TLR 7/8 agonist), Roche Holding Ltd (developing R017119929, a TLR7 agonist), BioNTech SE (developing BTN411, a TLR7 agonist), which are developing therapies utilizing TLR-agonists in cancer immunotherapy that may have utility for similar indications that we may be targeting.
 
Moreover, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. These third parties also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar or generic products.
