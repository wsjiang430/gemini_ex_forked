ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview 
CareDx, Inc., or “CareDx” or the “Company” or “we” or “us” and “our”, together with our subsidiaries, is a leading precision medicine company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic solutions for transplant patients and caregivers. We offer testing services, products, and patient and digital solutions along the pre- and post-transplant patient journey, and we are a leading provider of genomics-based information for transplant patients. Our headquarters are in Brisbane, California. Our primary operations are in Brisbane, California; Omaha, Nebraska; Fremantle, Australia and Stockholm, Sweden.
Our commercially available testing services consist of AlloSure® Kidney, a donor-derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA, solution for kidney transplant patients, AlloMap® Heart, a gene expression solution for heart transplant patients, AlloSure® Heart, a dd-cfDNA solution for heart transplant patients, and AlloSure® Lung, a dd-cfDNA solution for lung transplant patients. We have initiated clinical studies to generate data on our existing and planned future testing services. We have signed multiple biopharma research partnerships for AlloCell, a surveillance solution that monitors the level of engraftment and persistence of allogeneic cells for patients who have received cell therapy transplants. We also offer high-quality products that increase the chance of successful transplants by facilitating a better match between a donor and a recipient of stem cells and organs. In 2019, we began providing digital solutions to transplant centers following the acquisitions of Ottr Complete Transplant Management, or Ottr, and XynManagement, Inc., or XynManagement. We have since increased our offerings in patient and digital solutions with the 2021 acquisitions of TransChart LLC, or TransChart, MedActionPlan.com, LLC, or MedActionPlan, and The Transplant Pharmacy, or TTP. During 2022, we performed more than 182,000 commercial tests from our Brisbane, California, laboratory. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are approximately 235 and 143 centers performing kidney and heart transplants, respectively, in the United States.
Testing Services
We develop and provide diagnostic surveillance testing services for solid organ transplant recipients, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and recipients of engineered cell therapies.
Kidney
AlloSure Kidney, our transplant surveillance solution, was commercially launched in October 2017 and is our dd-cfDNA offering built on a Next Generation Sequencing, or NGS, platform. In transplantation, more than 100 papers from over 50 studies globally have shown the value of dd-cfDNA in the management of solid organ transplantation. AlloSure Kidney is able to discriminate dd-cfDNA from recipient-cell-free DNA, targeting polymorphisms between donor and recipient. This single-nucleotide polymorphism, or SNPs, approach across all the somatic chromosomes is specifically designed for transplantation, allowing a scalable, high-quality test to differentiate dd-cfDNA.
AlloSure Kidney has received positive coverage decisions for reimbursement from Medicare. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloSure Kidney is currently $2,841. AlloSure Kidney has received positive coverage decisions from several commercial payers, and is reimbursed by other private payers on a case-by-case basis.
Multiple studies have demonstrated that significant allograft injury can occur in the absence of changes in serum creatinine. Thus, clinicians have limited ability to detect injury early and intervene to prevent long-term damage using this marker. While histologic analysis of the allograft biopsy specimen remains the standard method used to assess injury and differentiate rejection from other injury in kidney transplants, as an invasive test with complications, repetitive biopsies are not well tolerated. AlloSure Kidney provides a non-invasive test, assessing allograft injury that enables more frequent, quantitative and safer assessment of allograft rejection and injury status. Beyond allograft rejection, the assessment of molecular inflammation has shown further utility in the assessment of proteinuria, the formation of De Novo donor specific antibodies, or DSAs, and as a surrogate predictive measure of estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, decline. Monitoring of graft injury through AlloSure Kidney allows clinicians to optimize allograft biopsies, identify allograft injury and guide immunosuppression management more accurately.
Since the analytical validation paper in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics in 2016 before the commercial launch of AlloSure Kidney, there has been an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of AlloSure Kidney dd-cfDNA in the assessment and surveillance of kidney transplants. Bloom et al evaluated 102 kidney recipients and demonstrated that dd-cfDNA levels could discriminate accurately and non-invasively distinguish rejection from other types of graft injury. In contrast, serum creatinine has area under the curve of 50%, showing no significant difference between patients with and without rejection. Multiple 
publications and abstracts have shown AlloSure Kidney’s value in the management of BK viremia, as well as numerous pathologies that cause molecular inflammation and injury such as DSAs and eGFR decline. Most recently, its utility in the assessment of T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) 1A and borderline rejection was published in the American Journal of Transplant, or AJT, and the outcomes of 1,000 patients were published in Kidney International.
The prospective multicenter trial, the Kidney Allograft Outcomes AlloSure Kidney Registry study, or K-OAR study, has enrolled over 1,700 patients, with plans to survey patients with AlloSure Kidney for 3 years and provide further clinical utility of AlloSure Kidney in the surveillance of kidney transplant recipients. Preliminary results from the K-OAR study were presented at the CareDx Symposium at the American Transplant Congress held in June 2021 and demonstrated:
•Implementation of AlloSure surveillance does not adversely impact 12-month eGFR.
•AlloSure is not affected by Interstitial Fibrosis and Tubular Atrophy, or IFTA – higher grades of IF/TA were not associated with increased AlloSure scores.
•Fewer biopsies - fewer patients in the KOAR cohort required one or more allograft biopsies compared to the DART surveillance cohort.
•AlloSure-guided biopsies are higher yield – the number of for-cause (clinically indicated) biopsies performed was similar to that seen in DART, but AlloSure-guided biopsies demonstrated higher yield for actionable findings.
•Higher AlloSure with transplant glomerulopathy – Transplant glomerulopathy relatively uncommon on biopsies within 1 year but a trend towards higher AlloSure scores when identified.
•Excellent graft and patient survival - graft survival slightly higher than contemporary United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) patient population, despite being a slightly higher risk cohort.
•Validated, reproducible performance - overall performance of AlloSure similar to that seen in other large cohorts, including DART and ADMIRAL.
KidneyCare
KidneyCare combines the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure Kidney with the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap Kidney and the predictive artificial intelligence technology of iBox in one surveillance solution. We have not yet made any applications to private payers for reimbursement coverage of AlloMap Kidney or iBox.
In September 2019, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the Outcomes of KidneyCare on Renal Allografts, or OKRA, study, which is an extension of the K-OAR study. OKRA is a prospective, multi-center, observational registry of patients receiving KidneyCare for surveillance. Combined with K-OAR, more than 3,000 patients have been enrolled into the study.
Heart
AlloMap Heart is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate-to-severe acute cellular rejection. Since 2008, we have sought to expand the adoption and utilization of our AlloMap Heart solution through ongoing studies to substantiate the clinical utility and actionability of AlloMap Heart, secure positive reimbursement decisions from large private and public payers, develop and enhance our relationships with key members of the transplant community, including opinion leaders at major transplant centers, and explore opportunities and technologies for the development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance.
We believe the use of AlloMap Heart, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a heart transplant, can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers avoid the use of unnecessary, invasive surveillance biopsies and may help to determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants. In 2008, AlloMap Heart received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for marketing and sale as a test to aid in the identification of heart transplant recipients, who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection at the time of testing, in conjunction with standard clinical assessment. The 510(k) clearance from the FDA is also for an In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay, or IVDMIA. AlloMap Heart Score Variability, or AMV, is an additional service we offer, which provides complementary information to help personalize long-term care of heart transplant recipients. It is available only upon request by clinicians. A patient’s AMV is based on the variability of a patient’s AlloMap Heart scores over time and may be used as a risk stratification tool in estimating the probability that one or more of the clinical events in heart transplant recipients may occur in the future. AMV may be computed from four AlloMap Heart test results within a 24-month period. In addition, the clinical utility of AlloMap Heart is supported by numerous clinical trials that we have sponsored, the results of which have been published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals.
AlloMap Heart has been a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries since January 1, 2006. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloMap Heart is currently $3,240. AlloMap Heart has also received positive coverage decisions for reimbursement from many of the largest U.S. private payers.
In October 2020, we received a final Palmetto MolDx Medicare coverage decision for AlloSure Heart. In November 2020, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, our Medicare Administrative Contractor, issued a parallel coverage policy granting coverage when used in conjunction with AlloMap Heart, which became effective in December 2020. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloSure Heart is currently $2,753. AlloSure Heart has received a positive coverage decision from Geisinger Health and is covered for use throughout Kaiser.
We have also successfully completed several landmark clinical trials in the transplant field demonstrating the clinical utility of AlloMap Heart for surveillance of heart transplant recipients. We initially established the analytical and clinical validity of AlloMap Heart based on our Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression Observational (Deng, M. et al., Am J Transplantation 2006), or CARGO study, which was published in the AJT. A subsequent clinical utility trial, Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression (Pham MX et al., N. Eng. J. Med., 2010), or IMAGE, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated that clinical outcomes in recipients managed with AlloMap Heart surveillance were equivalent (non-inferior) to outcomes in recipients managed with biopsies. The results of our clinical trials have also been presented at major medical society congresses. AlloMap Heart is now recommended as part of the ISHLT (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation) guidelines.
HeartCare
HeartCare includes the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap Heart with the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure Heart in one surveillance solution. An approach to surveillance using HeartCare provides information from two complementary measures: (i) AlloMap Heart – a measure of immune activation, and (ii) AlloSure Heart – a measure of graft injury.
Clinical validation data from the Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA-Outcomes AlloMap Registry (NCT02178943), or D-OAR, was published in the AJT in 2019. D-OAR was an observational, prospective, multicenter study to characterize the AlloSure Heart dd-cfDNA in a routine, clinical surveillance setting with heart transplant recipients. The D-OAR study was designed to validate that plasma levels of AlloSure Heart dd-cfDNA can discriminate acute rejection from no rejection, as determined by endomyocardial biopsy criteria.
HeartCare provides robust information about distinct biological processes, such as immune quiescence, active injury, Acute Cellular Rejection, or ACR, and Antibody Mediated Rejection, or AMR. In September 2018, we initiated the Surveillance HeartCare™ Outcomes Registry, or SHORE. SHORE is a prospective, multi-center, observational, registry of patients receiving HeartCare for surveillance. Patients enrolled in SHORE will be followed for 5 years with collection of clinical data and assessment of 5-year outcomes.
The most recent ISHLT guidelines published in 2022 reinforced their use of AlloMap Heart, and referenced the combined use of AlloSure Heart and AlloMap Heart for surveillance purposes.
Lung
In February 2019, AlloSure Lung became available for lung transplant patients through a compassionate use program while the test is undergoing further studies. One of these studies, launched in April 2020, is the ALARM, or AlloSure Lung Allograft Remote Monitoring, study, with Johns Hopkins University, where the impact of AlloSure Lung combined with RemoTraC is being measured. AlloSure Lung applies proprietary NGS technology to measure dd-cfDNA from the donor lung in the recipient bloodstream to monitor graft injury. In June 2020, we submitted an application to the Palmetto MolDx Technology Assessment program seeking coverage and reimbursement for AlloSure Lung and since then we have been in active discussions with Palmetto. In October 2021, we launched AlloSure Lung as part of the CHEST 2021 Annual Meeting. We have gained early adoption with some commercial payers.
Cellular Therapy
In April 2020, we initiated a research partnership for AlloCell, a surveillance solution that monitors the level of engraftment and persistence of allogeneic cells for patients who have received cell therapy. AlloCell is being commercialized through research agreements with biopharma companies developing cell therapies. We have executed multiple additional agreements with biopharma therapeutics companies to use AlloCell in research and clinical studies.
In July 2021, we launched the Assessing Chimerism and Relapse of Bone marrow/ HCT transplant using AlloHeme Testing, or ACROBAT, study. The ACROBAT study is a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study to evaluate the use of AlloHeme, a microchimerism NGS tool to predict post-transplant relapse in patients with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants, or HCT. This study is currently enrolling patients. 
Products
We develop, manufacture, market and sell products that increase the chance of successful transplants by facilitating a better match between a solid organ or stem cell donor and a recipient, and help to provide post-transplant surveillance of these recipients.
Our historical product portfolio includes QTYPE and Olerup SSP. QTYPE enables Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA, typing at a low to intermediate resolution for samples that require a fast turn-around-time and uses real-time polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, methodology. Olerup SSP is used to type HLA alleles based on the sequence specific primer, or SSP, technology.
On May 4, 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, which provides us with worldwide distribution, development and commercialization rights to Illumina’s NGS products and technologies for use in transplantation diagnostic testing.
On June 1, 2018, we became the exclusive worldwide distributor of Illumina’s TruSight HLA product line. TruSight HLA was discontinued in December 2021 and we have progressively converted existing customers to AlloSeq. In addition, we were granted the exclusive right to develop and commercialize other NGS product lines in the field of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation on diagnostic testing. These NGS products include: AlloSeq Tx, a high-resolution HLA typing solution, AlloSeq cfDNA, our surveillance solution designed to measure dd-cfDNA in blood to detect active rejection in transplant recipients, and AlloSeq HCT, a NGS solution for chimerism testing for stem cell transplant recipients.
In September 2019, we commercially launched AlloSeq cfDNA, our surveillance solution designed to measure dd-cfDNA in blood to detect active rejection in transplant recipients, and we received CE mark authorization on January 10, 2020. Our ability to increase the clinical uptake for AlloSeq cfDNA will be a result of multiple factors, including local clinical education, customer lab technical proficiency and levels of country-specific reimbursement.
Also in September 2019, we commercially launched AlloSeq Tx, the first of its kind NGS high-resolution HLA typing solution utilizing hybrid capture technology. This technology enables the most comprehensive sequencing, covering more of the HLA genes than other solutions on the market and adding coverage of non-HLA genes that may impact transplant patient matching and management. AlloSeq Tx has simple NGS workflow, with a single tube for processing and steps to reduce errors. AlloSeq Tx 17 received CE mark authorization on May 15, 2020.
In June 2020, we commercially launched AlloSeq HCT, a NGS solution for chimerism testing for stem cell transplant recipients. This technology has the potential to provide better sensitivity and data analysis compared to current solutions on the market. AlloSeq HCT received CE mark authorization in May 2022. 
In March 2021, we acquired certain assets of BFS Molecular S.R.L., or BFS Molecular, a software company focused on NGS-based patient testing solutions. BFS Molecular brings extensive software and algorithm development capabilities for NGS transplant surveillance products.
In May 2022, we commercially launched Tx9, a high throughput version of Tx17 for HLA typing in high volume laboratories. Tx9 received CE mark authorization in August 2022. 
Patient and Digital Solutions
In 2019, we began providing digital solutions to transplant centers following the acquisitions of Ottr and XynManagement.
On May 7, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Ottr. Ottr was formed in 1993 and is a leading provider of transplant patient management software, or the Ottr software, which provides comprehensive solutions for transplant patient management. The Ottr software enables integration with electronic medical records, or EMR, systems, including Cerner and Epic, providing patient surveillance management tools and outcomes data to transplant centers. 
On August 26, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of XynManagement. XynManagement provides two unique solutions, XynQAPI software, or XynQAPI and XynCare. XynQAPI simplifies transplant quality tracking and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, or SRTR, reporting. XynCare includes a team of transplant assistants who maintain regular contact with patients on the waitlist to help prepare for their transplant and maintain eligibility. Refer to Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail regarding these acquisitions.
In September 2020, we launched AlloCare, a mobile app that provides a patient-centric resource for transplant recipients to manage medication adherence, coordinate with Patient Care Managers for AlloSure scheduling and measure health metrics.
In January 2021, we acquired TransChart. TransChart provides EMR software to hospitals throughout the United States to care for patients who have or may need an organ transplant. As part of our acquisition of TransChart in January 2021, we acquired 
Tx Access, a cloud-based service that allows nephrologists and dialysis centers to electronically submit referrals to transplant programs, closely follow and assist patients through the transplant waitlist process, and ultimately, through transplantation.
In June 2021, we acquired the Transplant Hero patient application. The application helps patients manage their medications through alarms and interactive logging of medication events.
In June 2021, we entered into a strategic agreement, which was amended in April 2022, with OrganX to develop clinical decision support tools across the transplant patient journey. Together, we and OrganX will develop advanced analytics that integrate AlloSure, the first transplant specific dd-cfDNA assay, with large transplant databases to provide clinical data solutions. This partnership delivers the next level of innovation beyond multi-modality by incorporating a variety of clinical inputs to create a universal composite scoring system.
In November 2021, we acquired MedActionPlan, a New Jersey-based provider of medication safety, medication adherence and patient education. MedActionPlan is a leader in patient medication management for transplant patients and beyond.
In December 2021, we acquired TTP, a transplant focused pharmacy located in Mississippi. TTP provides individualized transplant pharmacy services for patients at multiple transplant centers located throughout the U.S.
COVID-19 Impact
In the final weeks of March and during April 2020, with hospitals increasingly caring for COVID-19 patients, hospital administrators chose to limit or even defer, non-emergency procedures. Immunosuppressed transplant patients either self-prescribed or were asked to avoid transplant centers and caregiver visits to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. As a result, with transplant surveillance visits down, we experienced a slowdown in testing services volumes in the final weeks of March and during April 2020. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to enable immune-compromised transplant patients to continue to have their blood drawn, in late March 2020, we launched RemoTraC, a remote home-based blood draw solution using mobile phlebotomy for AlloSure and AlloMap surveillance tests, as well as for other standard monitoring tests. 
There continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic as the Omicron variant, including its sub-variants, has periodically caused increases in COVID-19 cases globally, which in turn impacted the availability of medical personnel in transplant centers and the volume of transplant procedures. A sustained reduction in transplant volume can negatively impact our testing volumes, as we saw in the early part of the first quarter of 2022.
Our product business experienced a reduction in forecasted sales volume throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, as we were unable to undertake onsite discussions and demonstrations of our recently launched NGS products, including AlloSeq Tx 17, which was awarded CE mark authorization in May 2020. Our product business regained normalized sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2020.
We are maintaining our testing, manufacturing, and distribution facilities while implementing specific protocols to reduce contact among our employees. In areas where COVID-19 continues to impact healthcare operations, our field-based sales and clinical support teams are supporting providers through virtual platforms.
In addition, we created, and continue to have, a COVID-19 task force that is responsible for crisis decision making, employee communications, and enforcing all safety, monitoring and testing protocols in line with local regulations.
Due to COVID-19, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur or could impact personnel at third-party suppliers in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, and there may be disruptions in our supply chain. Any manufacturing supply interruption of materials could adversely affect our ability to conduct ongoing and future research and testing activities.
In addition, our clinical studies may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or reduced staffing due to staff members contracting COVID-19. Some patients may not be able to comply with clinical study protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, the ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to, or become infected with, COVID-19, may adversely impact our clinical trial operations.

Limitations of Existing Approaches for Surveillance of Transplant Recipients
The care of organ transplant recipients is an intense and costly effort and requires life-long surveillance and management by highly specialized clinicians and other healthcare providers. The estimated U.S. average 2020 charges for a heart transplant were $1.66 million and for a kidney transplant were $0.44 million for the period 30 days before the transplant and 180 days after the transplant. The lifetime cost for transplant recipients varies significantly depending on each individual patient's circumstances. Unsuccessful treatment of rejection can result in an additional transplant. In the case of a kidney transplant, the median annual Medicare cost of care for a recipient whose kidney fails and is on dialysis is 500% more than the median annual cost of care for a recipient with a functioning transplant.
The historical standard for heart transplant surveillance has been the microscopic examination of heart tissue obtained through an invasive endomyocardial biopsy. In the biopsy procedure, a catheter is inserted into the right internal jugular vein in the recipient’s neck and threaded into the right ventricle of the heart. Four pieces of tissue are cut from the wall of the heart and sent to the laboratory for examination by a pathologist who uses a microscope to look for evidence of cellular rejection. Limitations of biopsies include: (i) the pathologist evaluations, which are subjective and dependent upon visual assessment and qualitative interpretation, (ii) tissue sampling errors, and (iii) the potential for procedure related complications such as damage to the valve structures in the heart. The typical schedule of biopsy surveillance may involve eight to ten biopsies within the first six months after transplant and up to fifteen biopsies within the first year post-transplant. 
Because repeated biopsies can cause cumulative risk and trauma to the heart, the frequency of biopsy surveillance after one year is low, despite the fact that recipients would benefit from continued monitoring for rejection and management of their immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. With less biopsy data collected after the first year post-transplant, clinicians have less information upon which to tailor immunosuppression treatment for their recipients.
The use of renal biopsies for surveillance of kidney transplants is similarly limited due to the costs and risks associated with the invasive procedure. Therefore, the main clinical test of transplanted kidney surveillance is serum creatinine levels. An increase in serum creatinine levels is an indicator of diminished kidney function, and although this test is widely used, changes in serum creatinine are nonspecific as to cause and not sensitive, as serum creatinine may only be detected after significant and irreversible renal function loss has occurred.
The prevention and treatment of rejection in heart and kidney transplant recipients is managed primarily through the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Surveillance biopsies are infrequent after the first year because of procedural risks, discomfort, inconvenience, expense and the low rate of finding silent rejection. As a result, clinicians have limited and infrequent information about an individual recipient’s risk of rejection over the months and years following transplant. In the average recipient, the immune system gradually adapts to the organ graft, and the need for immunosuppression declines over time. However, there is meaningful variation in the level of rejection activity and need for immunosuppression among transplant recipients. Limited insight into the immune status of the individual recipient often causes clinicians to adopt a “one-size-fits all” approach to immunosuppression to help protect against the severe consequences of rejection. Although typical doses of immunosuppressants result in a low rate of rejection in the transplant population as a whole, many individuals may receive more intense immunosuppressants than they actually need.
The Need for a Better Surveillance Solution
Improved post-transplant diagnostics are necessary to achieve further gains in the long-term care and health outcomes of heart, kidney and other organ transplant recipients. More effective solutions for the surveillance and risk assessment of recipients would improve the clinician’s ability to individualize immunosuppression therapy and to reduce the use of invasive biopsies. We believe that core elements of effective surveillance solutions include:
•highly accurate and quantitative results differentiating rejection from non-rejection status;
•non-invasive procedures that do not create risks to the recipient;
•ease of implementation;
•earlier detection of rejection; and
•the ability to provide results with timing and at a frequency that allows for informed and effective treatment decisions.
Clinical Studies for our Testing Services
Kidney
In March 2017, the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology published the article Cell-Free DNA and Active Rejection in Kidney Allografts. The article reported that increased levels of dd-cfDNA detected using AlloSure Kidney are associated with active rejection of the kidney allograft. The Diagnosing Acute Rejection in Kidney Transplant Recipients, or DART, study evidence suggests that AlloSure Kidney, a non-invasive blood test, may enable more frequent, quantitative, and safer assessment of allograft rejection and injury. As part of a surveillance strategy, AlloSure Kidney could help identify patients with new or ongoing organ injury. In the DART study, to investigate the use of AlloSure Kidney as a surveillance tool, the investigators prospectively collected blood specimens from renal transplant patients at scheduled intervals and at the time of clinically indicated biopsies. Key findings of the study were as follows:
•AlloSure Kidney provides clear stratification of patients for probability of rejection;
•Active rejection patients showed median AlloSure Kidney levels at 1.6%;
•Antibody- mediated rejection, or ABMR, patients showed median AlloSure Kidney levels at 2.9%;
•Non-rejection patients showed median AlloSure Kidney levels of 0.21%; and
•AlloSure Kidney was superior to serum creatinine in identifying which patients had active rejection.
This was the first report to establish clinical performance characteristics for dd-cfDNA in renal transplant patients with an analytically validated assay of dd-cfDNA in the largest (N =398 patients) prospective, multicenter observational study of dd-cfDNA. Elevations in AlloSure Kidney were found to be strongly correlated with active rejection, especially ABMR. ABMR is increasingly recognized as the form of immune-mediated injury causing long-term graft loss. This progress was made possible by collaboration with 14 major renal transplant centers and their patients who volunteered to participate in the study.
A publication in the Journal of Applied Laboratory Medicine in March 2017 described the biological variation and clinical reference intervals of dd-cfDNA in stable healthy renal transplant recipients.
The AlloSure Kidney test has been approved for Medicare coverage for clinical use when a physician determines there is a need to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant recipients. The DART study suggests that AlloSure Kidney can be used to discriminate the probability of active rejection from absence of rejection in a renal transplant recipient. Use of the test may reduce invasive percutaneous renal biopsy procedures among patients with a suspicion of rejection.
Publications based on the analyses of the accumulated DART database results were used as a guide to design K-OAR. K-OAR is a multicenter, non-blinded, prospective observational cohort study which has enrolled more than 1,700 renal transplant recipients who will receive AlloSure Kidney as part of long-term surveillance. The clinical outcomes of these patients will be entered into a registry database as the patients will be surveilled for three years. 
The study cohort will include a minimum of 300 patients from centers that use renal surveillance biopsies showing the value of AlloSure Kidney in subclinical rejection. The remaining patients will be from centers that do not perform protocol surveillance biopsies, but for cause biopsies, which is the more common practice. Outcomes in these cohorts will be compared, showing the performance of AlloSure Kidney in all variations of clinical practice. A prospective propensity matched control cohort of 2,000 patients will be retrospectively analyzed from the subset of centers showing the value of AlloSure Kidney compared to its non-use. 
The primary safety endpoint of this study is the amount of kidney tissue scarring and atrophy at one-year post-transplant, quantified by biopsy-based histopathology grade(s). The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in eGFR with the number of renal allograft biopsies performed during the first year being a secondary outcome. Other endpoints include patient survival, graft survival, change and serum creatinine, evaluated at years 1, 2 and 3 post-transplantation.
In January 2018, we initiated the “K-OAR” study to develop additional data on the clinical utility of AlloSure Kidney for surveillance of kidney transplant recipients.
In September 2019, we announced the commencement of the “OKRA” study, which is an extension of K-OAR. OKRA is a prospective, multi-center, observational, registry of patients receiving KidneyCare for surveillance. KidneyCare combines the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure Kidney with the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap Kidney and the predictive artificial intelligence technology of iBox for a multimodality surveillance solution. We have not yet made any applications to private payers for reimbursement coverage of AlloMap Kidney or KidneyCare.
In December 2021, Kidney International published the article Clinical outcomes from the assessing donor derived cell free DNA monitoring Insights of kidney Allografts with Longitudinal surveillance (ADMIRAL). The article reports that increased levels of dd-cfDNA detected using AlloSure Kidney are associated with active rejection of the kidney allograft. ADMIRAL supports the work of DART further clinically validating the utility in a cohort of 1092 patients. The high-level summary of the manuscript shows:
•Use in both subclinical and clinical rejection: Elevated AlloSure (≥ 0.5%) strongly correlated with clinical and subclinical allograft rejection (p<0.001);
•Predictor of de novo donor-specific antibody (dnDSA): AlloSure associated with a 271% increased risk of development of dnDSA (p=0.001);
•Associated with development of dnDSA: Elevated AlloSure levels ≥ 0.5% was associated with 3 times increase in the risk of development of dnDSA;
•AlloSure as a leading indicator: AlloSure was elevated 91 days (median) ahead of DSA identification; 
•AlloSure is superior to serum creatinine (AUC of 80% v 49% respectively);
•Identifies eGFR decline: Persistently elevated AlloSure (>1 result above 0.5%) predicted a > 25% decline in eGFR over 3 years (HR 1.97, p = 0.041), while persistently low levels identify allograft quiescence; and
•AlloSure differentiates rejections which are going to cause long term damage vs short term rejection, which has treatment implications: oral outpatient treatment vs inpatient, expensive and potentially harmful therapies.
Heart
The clinical validation and utility of AlloMap Heart is supported by a number of major clinical trials involving more than 2,000 heart transplant recipients and published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. Our trials are designed to evaluate the clinical utility of our solutions and are an integral part of our business strategy, clinical development and marketing programs. In heart transplantation, two major observational trials, CARGO and CARGO II, enabled the initial development, validation and further validation of AlloMap Heart to detect and monitor acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients. In addition to preserving blood samples and clinical data from these two trials, we have sponsored a multi-year, 34 multicenter-registry named OAR, which focuses on long-term outcomes of patients. We expect these samples and data to enable further discovery and product development of new biomarkers of organ rejection activity, and new diagnostic solutions. These repositories contain over 37,000 samples obtained from individual recipients who were typically followed for 10 serial visits and over one year or more, and who in many cases have associated biopsy-based rejection grades and other clinical outcome endpoints. We believe this extensive biorepository and database will be useful for new product development derived from analyses, correlative studies and validation efforts.
Additional clinical utility trials, including IMAGE and the Early Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression, or EIMAGE, have demonstrated that clinical outcomes in recipients managed with AlloMap Heart surveillance were equivalent to outcomes in recipients managed with biopsies. We have also published two reports of retrospective analyses from IMAGE and CARGO II trials that demonstrate that the variability in AlloMap Heart scores over time in an individual patient may be useful in predicting the risk for the patient of a future event of rejection and graft dysfunction.
In September 2018, we initiated SHORE. SHORE is a prospective, multi-center, observational registry of patients receiving HeartCare for surveillance. HeartCare combines the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap Heart with the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure® Heart in one surveillance solution.
Products
Our suite of AlloSeq products are commercial “NGS”-based kitted solutions. These products include: AlloSeq™ Tx, a high-resolution “HLA” typing solution, AlloSeq™ cfDNA, a surveillance solution designed to measure dd-cfDNA in blood to detect active rejection in transplant recipients, and AlloSeq™ HCT, a solution for chimerism testing for stem cell transplant recipients.
Our other HLA typing products include: Olerup SSP, based on the “SSP” technology; and QTYPE, which uses real-time “PCR” methodology, to perform HLA typing.
QTYPE was commercially launched at the end of September 2016. QTYPE enables HLA typing at a low to intermediate resolution for samples that require a fast turn-around-time and uses real-time PCR methodology. QTYPE primarily focuses on low to intermediate resolution typing where high-resolution typing is not a requirement but even more rapid typing results are required, such as for deceased donor typing. Typing with QTYPE requires approximately one hour compared to the up to 2-3 hours that it takes to do traditional SSP typing and the 5-7 hours that it takes with sequence-specific oligonucleotides, or SSO.
Olerup SSP is used to type HLA alleles based on the SSP technology. The Olerup SSP product line comprises products for low to high-resolution HLA typing. The product line includes close to 115 different typing products. We offer one of the most up-to-date and comprehensive libraries of HLA typing kits based on SSP technology.
TruSight HLA was discontinued in December 2021 and we have progressively converted existing customers to AlloSeq. In addition, we were granted the exclusive right to develop and commercialize other NGS product lines in the field of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation on diagnostic testing. These products include: AlloSeq Tx, a high-resolution HLA typing solution, AlloSeq cfDNA, our surveillance solution designed to measure dd-cfDNA in blood to detect active rejection in transplant recipients, and AlloSeq HCT, a NGS solution for chimerism testing for stem cell transplant recipients. Our AlloSeq products are designed to run on Illumina’s NGS instrumentation.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities focus on developing cutting edge organ transplant surveillance solutions, further expanding on our pre-transplant matching solutions and seeking to continuously explore and develop new clinically-relevant approaches to our products. Clinical operations dedicated to the design and implementation of high quality studies and registries for data collection to develop evidence to address unmet clinical needs of transplant recipients are included in research and development. 
One area of focus for research and development activities has been to integrate acquired technology from the acquisitions of Ottr, XynManagement, TransChart and MedActionPlan and pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement with Cibiltech SAS. Integration of such technology with our current service offerings aligns a rich data set with augmented intelligence tools to better assess risk and help physicians better manage their daily patient care.
Research and development expenses of $90.4 million, $76.5 million and $48.9 million were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Testing Services Advancement and Development
Our research and development efforts are not limited to specific technology platforms, biomarkers or methodologies. Instead, we aim to leverage current and future innovations in biomarker identification and measurement, study design and data integration in developing future solutions.
dd-cfDNA for Kidney Transplants
Our published DART and Assessing AlloSure Dd-cfDNA Monitoring Insights of Renal Allografts With Longitudinal Surveillance (ADMIRAL) clinical studies have established the clinical validity of a dd-cfDNA-based solution for kidney transplant patients, AlloSure Kidney. DART was the first report to establish clinical performance characteristics for this molecular biomarker in renal transplant patients with an analytically validated assay of dd-cfDNA (N =398 patients) from a prospective, multicenter observational study of dd-cfDNA. The study population is representative of the spectrum renal transplant recipients in the United States. Elevations in AlloSure Kidney were found to be strongly correlated with active rejection, especially with ABMR. ABMR is increasingly recognized as the form of immune-mediated injury causing long-term graft loss.
K-OAR is the next step in the further development of data to support the clinical utility of AlloSure Kidney. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, Palmetto GBA, or Palmetto, in October 2017, recommended Medicare coverage for AlloSure Kidney. The K-OAR study commenced in January 2018. K-OAR is a 1-2 and 3-year post-transplant clinical outcomes study in approximately 1,700 patients managed with AlloSure Kidney surveillance compared to another 300 patients who will serve as a comparative control group managed without AlloSure Kidney.
OKRA is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry, designed to measure outcomes of kidney transplant recipients managed with KidneyCare. KidneyCare complements AlloSure Kidney to include multimodality testing with the addition of AlloMap Kidney Gene Expression Profiling and prognostic graft assessment using iBox. The patient transplant registry is statistically powered to determine the utility of KidneyCare and provide real world data on the use of KidneyCare and AlloSure Kidney. OKRA targets more than 50 transplant centers and will enroll approximately 1,500 newly transplanted patients, complementing the K-OAR with 1,500 patients, matching both arms with a total of 1,000 control patients.
The ADMIRAL article reports that increased levels of dd-cfDNA detected using AlloSure Kidney are associated with allograft rejection. The long term utility shown in a cohort of 1,092 patients supports the work of all of the publications prior to this. The use of routine monitoring of AlloSure after kidney transplant may allow clinicians to identify subclinical allograft injury and intervene prior to development of a clinically evident graft injury. To evaluate this, data from 1,092 kidney transplant recipients monitored for dd-cfDNA over a three-year period was analyzed to assess the association of dd-cfDNA with histologic evidence of allograft rejection. Elevation of dd-cfDNA (0.5% or more) was significantly correlated with clinical and subclinical allograft rejection. dd-cfDNA values of 0.5% or more were associated with a nearly three-fold increase in risk of development of de novo donor-specific antibodies (hazard ratio 2.71) and were determined to be elevated a median of 91 days (interquartile range of 30-125 days) ahead of donor specific antibody identification. Persistently elevated dd-cfDNA (more than one result above the 0.5% threshold) predicted over a 25% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate over three years (hazard ratio 1.97). Therefore, routine monitoring of dd-cfDNA allowed early identification of clinically important graft injury. Biomarker monitoring complemented histology and traditional laboratory surveillance strategies as a prognostic marker and risk-stratification tool post-transplant. Thus, persistently low dd-cfDNA levels may accurately identify allograft quiescence or absence of injury, paving the way for personalization of immunosuppression trials.
AlloMap Kidney Gene Expression Tool
The AlloMap Kidney test is a gene expression profile utilizing the RNA-seq platform to measure immune quiescence in kidney transplant patients. AlloMap Kidney has exhibited robust performance characteristics with an accuracy correlation coefficient of 0.997 and a precision coefficient of variation of 0.049 across testing. Clinical validation using samples from prospective, multi-center studies demonstrated a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66% for allograft rejection, while the negative predictive value to AlloSure Kidney was 95% to discriminate rejection from quiescence at 10% prevalence of rejection. 
dd-cfDNA for Heart Transplants
We believe that the AlloSure Heart dd-cfDNA-based solution provides additional value to AlloMap Heart.
Studies have reported that a higher percentage of dd-cfDNA in the bloodstream of patients is found with moderate or severe heart rejection compared to patients without rejection. A dd-cfDNA solution such as AlloSure for the heart could help clinicians identify recipients with a higher probability of rejection and help determine which patients warrant a subsequent biopsy, because the likelihood of detecting rejection in the biopsy specimen would be enhanced.
Accordingly, we offer HeartCare. HeartCare combines the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap Heart with the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure Heart in one surveillance solution. An approach to surveillance using HeartCare provides information from the two complementary measures: (i) AlloMap Heart – a measure of immune activation, and (ii) AlloSure Heart – which measures graft injury. HeartCare provides complementary information about distinct biological processes, such as immune quiescence, active injury, ACR and AMR in heart transplant recipients.
We have established our proprietary strategy for quantification of donor specific dd-cfDNA and published a validation study of AlloSure Heart in 2019. We offer AlloSure Heart as a laboratory developed test for management of heart transplant recipients and HeartCare is included as part of our SHORE registry of dd-cfDNA in association with gene-expression profiling (AlloMap Heart) in heart transplant recipients.
The 2021 ISHLT guidelines published in 2022 note the growing adoption of dd-cfDNA testing among heart transplant recipients. These guidelines advocate for lifelong surveillance of the transplanted heart for rejection and acknowledge the utility and evidence underlying the use of dd-cfDNA in surveillance for rejection in a framework of clinical surveillance. The guidelines also speak to the use of multimodality testing using GEP and dd-cfDNA in the surveilling the transplanted heart for rejection. 
HistoMap
We established a strategic research partnership with NanoString Technologies, Inc., or NanoString, dedicated to the development of HistoMap, a gene expression profiling, or GEP, solution to identify allograft rejection types in transplant biopsy tissue. The partnership will combine our clinical expertise and extensive transplant registries with NanoString’s technological capabilities to provide solutions that bring precision medicine to histopathology. We will utilize NanoString’s nCounter® technology in conjunction with the newly introduced Human Organ Transplant panel, a 770-gene panel designed to evaluate the human immune response in biopsy tissue from a transplanted organ. In May 2020, we established a partnership with Veracyte, Inc., pursuant to which we have certain exclusive worldwide field rights to develop and commercialize products, such as HistoMap using the nCounter technology. In 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Arkana Laboratories, a leading kidney pathology laboratory, to develop HistoMap Kidney.
Product Advancement and Development
Our ongoing research and development for our lab products business is focused on kitted products for pre-transplant and post-transplant patient testing. In the last decade of next generation, the ubiquity of sequencing has unveiled significant additional sequence diversity in the HLA region on chromosome 6 of the human genome. While the clinical impact of some of the sequence diversity is unclear, many newly identified HLA alleles need to be integrated into ongoing updates of the QTYPE and AlloSeq Tx kits. We have been updating, and intend to continue to update, our HLA typing kits with newly identified alleles. QTYPE and AlloSeq Tx use technology platforms that can readily accommodate this increase in HLA allele assays.
The advent of NGS technology has enabled significant improvement in HLA sequencing data. We are developing further improved versions of NGS HLA testing that will provide full gene coverage while streamlining the laboratory workflow. AlloSeq Tx is the first of its kind next-generation sequencing HLA typing solution, utilizing hybrid capture technology. This technology enables the most comprehensive sequencing available, covering more of the HLA genes than current solutions and adding coverage of non-HLA genes that may impact transplant patient matching and patient management. Our HLA typing products are used in labs throughout the world to help determine which organs or bone marrow are a transplantation match between the donor and the recipient.
We expanded our market-leading portfolio of NGS transplantation offerings with the global launch of AlloSeq cfDNA and AlloSeq HCT. These post-transplant surveillance products enable access to our dd-cfDNA technology to laboratories and patients outside the United States. We also introduced AlloSeq Tx at the 2019 ASHI Annual Meeting and continue to improve the product. 
Finally, our research and development staff are collaborating to advance the synergies of products across the pre- and post-transplant continuum.
Patient and Digital Solutions Business Development
We develop, deploy and promote a rational set of software tools and data-driven services that provide clinical utility with respect to medication adherence and overall patient health. Our vision is to add smart analytics and machine learning to artificial intelligence in transplant. Going forward, we will strive to bring our multi-modality testing solutions and machine learning algorithms to the transplant clinic under our AiTraC umbrella. AiTraC will utilize the large clinical data that are collected through our registry studies to provide caregivers with point of care decision-making support tools that allow them to stratify the patient population.
We acquired Ottr and XynManagement in 2019. These acquisitions have strengthened our growing portfolio of transplant software solutions such as Ottr and XynQAPI. In 2021, we acquired TransChart, MedActionPlan and TTP. We are committed to continue upgrading these software programs, including medication adherence management, and further integrating them into our current testing service offerings to provide a unified user experience.
We are actively working on additional partnerships and patient-focused service offerings. 
Reimbursement
We have been successful in achieving reimbursement for our testing services. Reimbursement for AlloSure Kidney comes primarily from Medicare. Reimbursement for AlloMap Heart comes primarily from Medicare and private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations. 
Medicare
We are reimbursed by Medicare for AlloSure Kidney, AlloMap Heart and AlloSure Heart tests performed on patients covered by Medicare. Tests performed on patients covered by Medicare represented 34%, 40% and 48% of all tests in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 64%, 68% and 67% of all testing services revenue was derived from Medicare for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
AlloSure Kidney has been a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries since October 2017. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloSure Kidney is currently $2,841. AlloSure Kidney has received positive coverage decisions from several commercial payers, and is reimbursed by other private payers on a case-by-case basis.
Following the assignment of a Category 1 Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT code, for AlloMap Heart in September 2015, CMS issued a proposed Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, Preliminary Determinations for calendar year 2016. In October 2016, CMS reversed its preliminary gapfill determination for the 2017 CLFS and restored the final pricing determinations for AlloMap Heart in the 2017 CLFS to $2,821. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS would report initially and then on a subsequent three-year basis thereafter (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, or ADLTs), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests. CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payer payment rates for the tests. The CARES Act freezes current (2020) CMS CLFS rates through 2021. Further, the CARES Act delays the reporting cycle under PAMA to January 1 and March 31, 2025, and the preceding data collection period will become January 1 through June 30, 2024. In December 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and Medicare Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act.
AlloMap Heart has been a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries since January 2006. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloMap Heart is currently $3,240. AlloMap Heart has also received positive coverage decisions for reimbursement from many of the largest U.S. private payers.
In October 2020, we received a final Palmetto MolDx Medicare coverage decision for AlloSure Heart. In November 2020, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, our Medicare Administrative Contractor, issued a parallel coverage policy granting coverage when used in conjunction with AlloMap Heart, which became effective in December 2020. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloSure Heart is currently $2,753. AlloSure Heart has received a positive coverage decision from Geisinger Health and is covered for use throughout Kaiser.
Private Payers and Medicaid Payers
Due to End Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD, regulations by Medicare, most ESRD patients are covered by Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans and have access to AlloSure Kidney. Private payers that have adopted a positive coverage policy include BCBS payers as well as other national payers. However, other private payers and Medicaid payers have not yet adopted positive coverage policies for AlloSure Kidney. 
We are reimbursed for a substantial portion of the AlloMap Heart tests we perform on patients covered by private payers. Coverage policies approving AlloMap Heart have approached nearly 90% of all covered lives and are published by many of the largest private payers, including several BCBS plans and UnitedHealthcare. Many other payers have positive coverage policies for AlloMap Heart.
AlloSure Heart and AlloSure Kidney are covered by several commercial payers. For all tests performed outside the scope of the payer’s policy, and for tests performed where the payer has not adopted a coverage policy, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. If a reimbursement claim is denied, we generally pursue payment through the particular payer’s appeal process.
International
Our lab products have a broad international presence. We sell directly to customers in many regions and also sell through third-party distributors and sub-distributors throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
Testing and Laboratory Operations
AlloSure Kidney, AlloSure Lung, AlloMap Heart and AlloSure Heart testing is performed in our clinical laboratory, which is located in our Brisbane, California location. Our laboratory holds a certificate of accreditation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and is accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP. We believe that our laboratory capacity will be adequate to meet demand for AlloSure Kidney, AlloSure Lung, AlloMap Heart, AlloSure Heart and other tests in the development pipeline for the next few years.
When a clinician orders AlloMap Heart, a blood sample is drawn and processed to isolate the white blood cells, which are subsequently broken down, frozen and sent via overnight courier to our laboratory. Each of the 20 genes comprising AlloMap Heart is tested in triplicate, and the 11 informative genes are combined to produce the AlloMap Heart score. The remaining 9 genes are used as part of the rigorous quality control testing performed to assess every phase of the test process. The test results are typically reported to the ordering clinician by fax or electronically via EMR or WebPortal within two business days of receipt of the sample. Test samples that fail to meet quality control criteria are immediately re-tested and the ordering clinician is notified of the need to re-test if turnaround time will be affected.
When AlloSure Kidney, AlloSure Heart or AlloSure Lung is ordered by a clinician, a blood sample is drawn and sent overnight at ambient temperature to our laboratory. Cell-free DNA is purified from the plasma and the fraction of the total cell-free DNA derived from the transplanted organ, the dd-cfDNA, is quantified and reported as a percentage. Tests that fail to meet quality control criteria are immediately re-tested and the ordering clinician is notified of the need to re-test if turnaround time will be affected. Results are typically reported to the ordering clinician by fax or electronically via EMR or WebPortal within two business days of receipt of the sample. Test samples that fail to meet quality control criteria are immediately re-tested and the ordering clinician is notified of the need to re-test if turnaround time will be affected.
We rely solely on certain suppliers to provide some of the laboratory instruments and key reagents that we use to perform AlloSure Kidney, AlloSure Lung, AlloMap Heart, and AlloSure Heart testing. These sole source suppliers include Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., or Thermo Fisher, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents, a master mix formula and consumables; Roche Molecular Systems, which supplies us with laboratory reagents and consumables; Hamilton Robotics, which supplies equipment and consumables; Illumina, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents and consumables; Becton, Dickinson and Company, and Streck, which supply us with cell preparation tubes; Beckman Coulter, which provides laboratory equipment, reagents and consumables; and Qiagen N.V., which supplies us with a proprietary buffer reagent.
Manufacturing
We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our product kits from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and critical raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop alternate backup plans to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Due to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to the manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. 
In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our manufacturing facility in Stockholm, Sweden is used to support the production, packaging and labeling of our proprietary test kits: Olerup SSP, XM-One, and QTYPE. The facility has a certified Quality Management System, or QMS, to the ISO 13485: 2016 standard. This standard includes a special set of requirements specifically related to the supply of medical devices and related services. ISO is an internationally recognized standard for QMS. Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification. The facility maintains a valid EC certificate for compliance to Directive 98/79/EC Annex IV, excluding Sections 4 and 6, Full Quality Assurance System In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. Annual surveillance audits are also conducted by the site’s notified body to ensure ongoing compliance. 
Additionally, we seek to manufacture to current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and our QMS is implemented in accordance with FDA Quality System Regulations.
Our manufacturing facility in Fremantle, Australia, is used to support the production, packaging and labeling of our proprietary AlloSeq brand kits. The facility maintains a valid EC certificate for compliance to Directive 98/79/EC Annex IV, excluding Sections 4 and 6, Full Quality Assurance System In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices, and is certified to standards ISO 13485: 2016 and the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System, or CMDCAS, for Medical Devices, undergoing the same certification and surveillance audit requirements.

Our pharmacy sales support team is located in Flowood, Mississippi. 
Competition
With our comprehensive portfolio of surveillance testing services, diagnostic products and patient and digital solutions business offerings, we face many different types of competition.
Testing Services
Our competition principally includes clinical reference labs and hospital labs using existing and routine clinical chemistry tests. Our competitors also include companies that are focused on the development and commercialization of molecular diagnostic tests. In the field of post-transplant surveillance, Natera Inc., or Natera, and Eurofins Viracor, Inc., or Eurofins, have commercially available molecular diagnostics tests.
We expect the competition for post-transplant surveillance to increase as there are several established and early-stage companies in the process of developing products and services for the transplant market that may directly or indirectly compete with AlloSure Kidney, AlloSure Lung, AlloMap Heart, AlloSure Heart or our development pipeline. In addition, companies that have not historically focused on transplantation, but have knowledge of dd-cfDNA technology, have indicated they are considering this market. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets include:
•quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data;
•confidence in diagnostic results;
•technical performance and innovation to deliver new products that provide clinically actionable results;
•reputation among customers as a provider of high value transplant diagnostic tests and diagnostic test services;
•the extent of reimbursement;
•inclusion in practice guidelines;
•cost-effectiveness; and
•ease of use.
We believe we compete favorably on the factors described above.
Existing diagnostic methods for kidney transplant rejection include general, non-specific clinical chemistry tests, although biopsies are also a surveillance diagnostic tool. Existing diagnostic methods for heart transplant rejection generally involve evaluating biopsy samples to determine the presence or absence of rejection. 
These practices have been the standard of care in the United States for many years, and we will need to continue to educate clinicians, transplant recipients and payers about the various benefits of our tests in order to change clinical practice. Also, many transplant centers are located within hospitals that have their own laboratory facilities and have capacity to conduct various tests, and some hospitals may choose to rely on internally developed and/or internally performed surveillance and diagnostic tests.
Products
Our competitors within the HLA tissue typing markets comprise a diverse range of manufacturers servicing hospital and commercial reference testing laboratories. The market leader in HLA typing and third party distributors is Thermo Fisher through its acquisition of transplant-focused companies One Lambda and Linkage Biosciences. In certain HLA tissue typing markets that incorporate a wide variety of technology test platforms, such as SSP, SSO and NGS, competitors include Thermo Fisher, Omixon, GenDx, BAG, Qiagen, and Immucor. We also face competition from hospital and commercial reference labs that develop their own in-house testing solutions known in the diagnostics industry as “home brews”. We believe that our product line competes favorably with Thermo Fisher as a leading supplier of HLA test kits based on performance, reputation and service.
We expect future competition for post-transplant surveillance kitted solutions for AlloSeq cfDNA and AlloSeq HCT. There are several established and early-stage companies in the process of developing products and services for the transplant market that may directly or indirectly compete with our development pipeline. In addition, companies that have not historically focused on transplantation, but have knowledge of dd-cfDNA technology, have indicated they are considering the transplantation market.
Patient and Digital Solutions
Our competition for patient solutions includes hospital-affiliated pharmacies located on-site at the transplant center and specialty pharmacies that provide transplant-specific care and dispensing services. Competition for our digital solutions include various companies that develop application software and operate in the healthcare field. Our primary competitor for our patient management EMR solution is Phoenix, Epic's transplant application. In addition, other established and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may commercialize competitive products including informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness.
Intellectual Property
Patents and Proprietary Technology
In order to remain competitive, we seek to develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, material data transfer agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We generally protect this information with confidentiality agreements and reasonable security measures.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 20 issued U.S. patents related to transplant rejection and autoimmunity. Among those, we have two issued U.S. patents covering methods of diagnosing transplant rejection using all 11 informative genes measured in AlloMap Heart. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2023 to 2024. We have four additional patents covering additional genes or gene variants for diagnosing transplant rejection or autoimmune disease.
In connection with our June 2014 acquisition of ImmuMetrix, Inc., we obtained an exclusive license from Stanford to one U.S. patent issued in April 2014 relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA. Additional patents from Stanford included in the exclusive license were issued, including one in 2017, two in 2019, four in 2021 and two in 2022, that further cover the use of dd-cfDNA to diagnose and predict transplant status or outcome. These patents are expiring between 2030 and 2032.
We have developed trade secrets and know-how since our inception. These trade secrets and know-how are found particularly in technical areas such as optimized systems for making precise and reproducible q-PCR, measurements, and in the analysis of genomic data and algorithm development.
AlloMap, AlloSure, AlloCell, AlloHeme, QTYPE, Ottr and CareDx are registered trademarks of ours in the United States.
License Agreements
We currently rely on license agreements to obtain rights under certain patents that we believe may be necessary to make, use and sell our AlloSure tests and future solutions. We may in the future rely, at least in part, upon licensing agreements with third parties to obtain patent rights and transfers of technology, information and know-how that enable us to further our development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. Of the 20 existing U.S. patents related to transplant rejection and autoimmunity, nine are the product of exclusive licensing agreements.
In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Stanford, which granted us an exclusive license to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA and a non-exclusive license to related technology provided by Stanford. Subject to various rights of extension, we are required to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones set forth in the license agreement. Under the terms of the Stanford license, we are required to report and pay royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products incorporating the licensed technology. 
In May 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with Illumina, which provides us with worldwide distribution, development and commercialization rights to Illumina’s next generation sequencing product line for use in transplantation diagnostic testing. Two issued patents for HLA genotyping are exclusively licensed as part of this agreement.
On April 30, 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Cibiltech SAS, or Cibiltech, pursuant to which we were granted an irrevocable, non-transferable right to commercialize Cibiltech’s proprietary software, iBox, for the predictive analysis of post-transplantation kidney allograft loss in the field of transplantation in the U.S. for a period of ten years.
In April 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Cornell University pursuant to which we were granted exclusive rights to three patents and two patent applications covering methods and technology for measurement of gene expression in urine to diagnose kidney transplant rejection.
In June 2021, we entered into a strategic agreement, which was amended in April 2022, with OrganX to develop clinical decision support tools across the transplant patient journey. Together, we and OrganX will develop advanced analytics that integrate AlloSure, the first transplant specific dd-cfDNA assay, with large transplant databases to provide clinical data solutions. This partnership delivers the next level of innovation beyond multi-modality by incorporating a variety of clinical inputs to create a universal composite scoring system.

Our business is subject to and impacted by frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States and internationally. These laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g., U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Sarbanes Oxley Act, and similar laws of other jurisdictions). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Below are certain key regulations applicable to our business.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
Having a clinical laboratory in California, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under the CLIA, administered by CMS, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of work we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, quality systems, proficiency testing and performance. Most clinical laboratories are subject to regulation under the CLIA, which is designed to ensure that laboratory testing services performed on materials derived from the human body are accurate and reliable.
We have a certificate of accreditation under the CLIA to perform “high complexity” testing. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent personnel and quality system requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. We were inspected as part of the customary College of American Pathologists audit and recertified in March 2022 as a result of passing that inspection. We expect the next regular inspection under the CLIA to occur in 2024.
California Laboratory Licensing
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under the CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory. We are required to maintain compliance with California standards as a condition to continued operation of our laboratory in California.
Other States’ Laboratory Testing
Other states require out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens for testing from those states to be licensed. We have obtained licenses in California, Florida, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws.
Food and Drug Administration
The FDA regulates the design, testing, development, manufacture, safety, labeling, marketing, promotion, storage, sale and distribution of medical devices pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FFDCA and its implementing regulations govern, among other things, the following activities relating to our medical devices: preclinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, import/export, and advertising and promotion. These regulations apply to all of our products sold in the United States, as well as our facilities in Stockholm, Sweden used to produce some of our products. The FDA has also asserted that it has the authority to regulate laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, as medical devices under the FFDCA. An LDT is a test developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory, such as AlloMap Heart or AlloSure Kidney.
The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because it regulates the primary components in most laboratory-developed tests and because laboratories, such as ours, certified as high complexity under the CLIA are regulated and reviewed by CMS to ensure that lab expertise and test procedures and correct analyses are followed. In the event the FDA changes their policy in regards to “Enforcement discretion” for LDTs, it could require us to modify our business model and incur higher costs in order to maintain compliance with this new policy. A similar situation may occur if Congress decides to enable newly proposed regulations, such as the updated Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2021. For AlloSure Kidney and other similar testing solutions, if required by the FDA or if new laws are enacted we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate clinical validity and utility of our test, and submit to the FDA a premarket approval application, or PMA, or 510(k) premarket notification application and obtain approval or clearance for the test subsequent to commercialization. There can be no assurance that any of our tests or additional uses of our tests for which we seek clearance or approval in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, or at all, and there can be no assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our current and future tests. Moreover, any new FDA or regulatory requirements could complicate our compliance efforts.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information and standardize data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and the standardized identifiers used by healthcare providers, such as us, and health plans. 
We have developed policies and procedures in view of these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements, business practices change or a significant breach to protected health information, or PHI, occurs.
In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our operations. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps intended to address health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject.
Whether regulators may find our policies, procedures and other privacy initiatives to be compliant with HIPAA is subject to the regulator's assessment.
Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions
We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar state restrictions such as California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. Where applicable, these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing patients or certain governmental or private payers for clinical laboratory testing services when the physician ordering the test, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
Both the Stark Law and PORA contain exceptions for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements and clinical advisory boards. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to address the requirements of the applicable exceptions to the Stark Law, PORA and other similar state laws. However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with the Stark Law, PORA or similar state laws.
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
•denial of Medicare payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
•refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
•a civil penalty of up to $26,125 per service for submitting or causing to be submitted a claim in violation of the Stark Law and an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed;
•exclusion from federal health care programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and
•a civil penalty of up to $174,172 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions.
Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Privacy Laws
Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs and across the healthcare system. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.
There have previously been public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress regarding their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and the Biden administration has announced plans to expand the federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives, including at the federal level, will be initiated or the effect any such initiatives could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018
The Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, prohibits payments for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, and laboratories. EKRA’s reach extends beyond federal health care programs to include private insurance (i.e., it is an “all payer” statute). For purposes of EKRA, the term “laboratory” is defined broadly and without reference to any connection to substance use disorder treatment. EKRA is a criminal statute and violations can result in fines of up to $200,000, up to 10 years in prison, or both, per violation. The law includes a limited number of exceptions, some of which closely align with corresponding Anti-Kickback Statute exceptions and safe harbors and others that materially differ.
Information Blocking Prohibition
On May 1, 2020, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology promulgated final regulations under the authority of the 21st Century Cures Act to impose new conditions to obtain and maintain certification of certified health information technology and prohibit certain covered actors—developers of certified health information technology, health information networks / health information exchanges, and health care providers (including laboratories)—from engaging in activities that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information (information blocking). 
The final regulations further defined exceptions for activities that are permissible, even though they may have the effect of interfering with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information. Originally, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology established an information blocking effective date of November 2, 2020; however, the agency subsequently issued an interim final rule to extend the effective date to April 5, 2021. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, health care providers that violate the information blocking prohibition will be subject to appropriate disincentives, which the U.S. Department of Health and Human services has yet to establish through required rulemaking. Developers of certified information technology and health information networks / health information exchanges, however, may be subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per violation. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to impose such penalties and on April 24, 2020 published a proposed rule to codify new authority in regulation, which the agency proposed would be effective 60 days after it issues a final rule, but in no event before November 2, 2020. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has not yet issued a final rule.
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The federal health care programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for referring an individual for the furnishing of or arranging for the furnishing of any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, services, or item payable under such programs.
The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute to mean that if any one purpose of remuneration is to induce or reward referrals of federal health care program payable business, the statute has been violated. The statute contains a number of statutory exceptions and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has created several regulatory "safe harbors." Arrangements that meet all of the conditions of an applicable exception or safe harbor are protected from liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, the failure to fit an arrangement within an exception or a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the statute has been violated or that the arrangement will be prosecuted. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute also are actionable under the federal False Claims Act.
Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
Federal False Claims Act 
The federal False Claims Act, which includes “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely the federal government.
When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $11,803 and $23,607 for each false claim for penalties assessed after December 31, 2021. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of, among other things, causing physicians to order excessive or unnecessary services, providing false documentation in support of claims, kickbacks, off-label promotion of products, and Stark Law violations and other improper referrals, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to billing, compliance with certain regulations and Medicare reimbursement requirements, physician and other healthcare provider financial relationships and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
State Privacy Laws
New U.S. state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which took effect in January 2020, and was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act effective January 2023, secure new privacy rights for consumers and impose new obligations on us. Other states have similarly adopted privacy laws, which take effect in 2023, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut.
Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by adhering to these regulatory requirements and the related costs of ensuring and maintaining compliance. In addition, we cannot predict how future regulatory conditions will affect our business and may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
Foreign Jurisdictions
Laws and regulations outside of the United States also apply to our products. The number and scope of these requirements continues to grow, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any approvals that may be required to market our pre-transplant line of products outside the United States. Further, there may be significant expense and effort required to comply with these approvals for new products as they become ready for the commercial marketplace or for our existing products that we wish to sell abroad.
We currently produce products, which are CE labeled and subject to the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC), or IVDD, a European Union, or EU, Directive. Some of our products are currently labeled by self-declaration based on 
their intended use or certified by a Notified Body for Compliance to the IVDD requirements. A product that is not CE marked is automatically considered to be non-compliant. Appointed national enforcement agencies monitor the market for violations and imported products are checked for compliance at customs offices.
No in vitro device or accessory may be placed on the market or put into service unless it satisfies the essential requirements set forth in the IVDD. Devices considered to meet the essential requirements must bear the CE marking of conformity, placed by the manufacturer, when introduced on the market. A manufacturer placing devices on the market in its name must notify its national competent authorities.
These CE labeled products are also falling under requirements of the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (2017/746) (IVDR). The IVDR requirements are applied starting May 26, 2022. The European Commission recently confirmed adoption of a proposal for a progressive roll-out of the IVDR to prevent disruption in the supply of In-Vitro Diagnostic products to the market. The proposal does not change any requirements of the IVDR or change the implementation date but changes the transitional provisions to allow a progressive rollout based on the risk level of the device. 
In accordance with these timelines, our current CE marked products will remain available to customers throughout the transition period. There is currently no anticipated supply risk based on the implementation of the IVDR in May 2022. The date of certification for our products under the IVDR is currently under review in consultation with our notified body and certification of these products to the IVDR shall be achieved within the transition timeframes. We are also actively working with our Notified Body to bring the Quality management system at the sites to be compliant to IVDR requirements by May 2026. 
Certain of our products also comply with the CMDCAS, which is a system designed to implement Canadian regulations requiring some medical devices be designed and manufactured under a registered QMS. The SCC and Health Canada's Therapeutic Products Directorate developed this system. CMDCAS came into effect January 1, 2003.
GDPR and UK GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or the GDPR, is a regulation on data protection and privacy in the EU, and the European Economic Area, or the EEA, that went into effect in May 2018. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. The regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals, or data subjects, who reside in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA. Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, the United Kingdom adopted the Data Protection Act 2018, which is the United Kingdom’s implementation of the GDPR, or the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR imposes similar requirements for personal data about United Kingdom data subjects.
Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the GDPR and UK GDPR principles and provide safeguards to protect data. Data controllers and processors must design information systems with privacy in mind. No personal data may be processed unless it is done under one of six lawful bases specified by the regulation (consent, contract, public interest, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time. 
Data controllers and processors must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA, or, in the case of the UK GDPR, outside of the UK. Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a data controller or processor in a common format, and, under certain circumstances, the right to have their data erased. Businesses must report data breaches to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR or UK GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater. 
Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by adhering to these regulatory requirements and the related costs of ensuring and maintaining compliance.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
On December 31, 2022, we had 738 employees, of which 727 were full-time employees. We had 185 employees in manufacturing operations and support, 192 in research and development, 239 in sales and marketing and 122 in general and administrative positions. As of December 31, 2022, 648 employees were located in the United States and 90 were located outside of the United States.
The diagnostics industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances, which require an adept and skilled workforce. We believe that it is critical to attract, develop and retain employees with the experience, knowledge, expertise and vision capable of not only operating, but also excelling, in this complex and competitive business environment, including competing against larger competitors and developing and commercializing new products, new and improved technologies and new applications for our existing technologies.
We consider our employees to be our greatest asset and therefore focus on attracting, developing, retaining and motivating our employees. Our recruitment and retention strategies include partnerships with external agencies to help hire top talent, onboarding processes, a leadership development program and a professional work environment that promotes innovation and rewards performance.
We believe employee career development is an investment in our employees’ skills and our future. We offer our employees various training opportunities free of charge and during working hours. For example, in 2022, we launched LinkedIn Learning platform, a learning library and repository for self-guided personal and professional learning opportunities. In addition, we dedicated time on a quarterly basis for all employees to explore learning and development topics. We call this Care4U Time. 
In addition, we believe it is important to have regular engagement with our employees to understand their needs. Apart from regular weekly meetings with managers, monthly town hall meetings and quarterly earnings reports and calls, we also conduct annual anonymous employee surveys to understand current employee sentiment, areas we are excelling in as well as areas for improvement. 
Our total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Through our global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, we are committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; an employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.
In addition, the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being, health and safety of our employees. We are maintaining our testing, manufacturing, and distribution facilities while implementing specific protocols to reduce contact among our employees. In areas where COVID-19 continues to impact healthcare operations, our field-based sales and clinical support teams are supporting providers through telephone and online platforms. 
We also created, and continue to have, a COVID-19 task force that is responsible for crisis decision making, employee communications, and ensuring all safety, monitoring and testing protocols in line with local regulations.
From time to time, we also employ independent contractors, consultants and temporary employees to support our operations. Currently, our SSP production group in Sweden is represented by an IF Metall collective bargaining agreement. None of our other employees are represented by a union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe that our relations with our employees are good.
We have zero-tolerance policy for discrimination. In 2021, we established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee to engage, retain and develop talent from diverse backgrounds by facilitating diversity, equity and inclusion advocacy through event sponsorship, leaning and client engagement. We have increased the diversity of our Board and leadership teams and continue to focus on maintaining a diverse organization. Our senior leadership team includes leaders with diverse skills, experience, racial background and genders. Our employees come from numerous countries and various backgrounds and we strive to provide a diverse and inclusive environment. 
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials), which subjects us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, or holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we could be subject to significant fines for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety 
requirements. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
In addition, we look for ways to minimize our impact on the environment. Our main buildings headquartered in California are energy efficiency certified and meet stringent San Francisco Bay Area requirements for environmental impact, and several of our offices are in new energy efficient buildings. Our offices also provide recycling and use low flow fixtures to conserve water, and we take additional measures to conserve energy through LED fixtures, light timers/sensors, and thermostat regulation.
