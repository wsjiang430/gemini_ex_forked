Item 1. Business
Our Company
Matterport is leading the digitization and datafication of the built world. We believe the digital transformation of the built world will fundamentally change the way people interact with buildings and the physical spaces around them.
Since its founding in 2011, Matterport’s pioneering technology has set the standard for digitizing, accessing and managing buildings, spaces and places online. Our platform’s innovative software, spatial data-driven data science, and 3D capture technology have broken down the barriers that have kept the largest asset class in the world, buildings and physical spaces, offline and underutilized for many years. We believe the digitization and datafication of the built world will continue to unlock significant operational efficiencies and property values, and that Matterport is the platform to lead this enormous global transformation.
The world is rapidly moving from offline to online. Digital transformation has made a powerful and lasting impact across every business and industry today. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, over $6.8 trillion of direct investments will be made on digital transformation from 2020 to 2023, the global digital transformation spending is forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion in 2026 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.3%, and digital twin investments are expected to have a five-year CAGR of 35.2%. With this secular shift, there is also growing demand for the built world to transition from physical to digital. Nevertheless, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain offline and undigitized. The global building stock, estimated by Savills to be $327 trillion in total property value as of 2021, remains largely offline today, and we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation.
Matterport was among the first to recognize the increasing need for digitization of the built world and the power of spatial data, the unique details underlying buildings and spaces, in facilitating the understanding of buildings and spaces. In the past, technology advanced physical road maps to the data-rich, digital maps and location services we all rely on today. Matterport now digitizes buildings, creating a data-rich environment to vastly increase our understanding and the full potential of each and every space we capture. Just as we can instantly, at the touch of a button, learn the fastest route from one city to another or locate the nearest coffee shops, Matterport’s spatial data for buildings unlocks a rich set of insights and learnings about properties and spaces worldwide. In addition, just as the geo-spatial mapping platforms of today have opened their mapping data to industry to create new business models such as ridesharing, e-commerce, food delivery marketplaces, and even short-term rental and home sharing, open access to Matterport’s structured spatial data is enabling new opportunities and business models for hospitality, facilities management, insurance, construction, real estate and retail, among others.
We believe the total addressable market opportunity for digitizing the built world is over $240 billion, and could be as high as $1 trillion as the market matures at scale. This is based on our analysis, modeling and understanding of the global building stock of over 4 billion properties and 20 billion spaces in the world today. With the help of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”) and deep learning (“DL”) technologies, we believe that, with the additional monetization opportunities from powerful spatial data-driven property insights and analytics, the total addressable market for the digitization and datafication of the built world will reach more than $1 trillion.
Our spatial data platform and capture of digital twins deliver value across a diverse set of industries and use cases. Large retailers can manage thousands of store locations remotely, real estate agencies can provide virtual open houses for hundreds of properties and thousands of visitors at the same time, property developers can monitor the entirety of the construction process with greater detail and speed, and insurance companies can more precisely document and evaluate claims and underwriting assessments with efficiency and precision. Matterport delivers the critical digital experience, tools and information that matter to our subscribers about properties of virtually any size, shape, and location worldwide.
For nearly a decade, we have been growing our spatial data platform and expanding our capabilities in order to create the most detailed, accurate, and data-rich digital twins available. Moreover, our 3D reconstruction process is fully automated, allowing our solution to scale with equal precision to millions of buildings and spaces of any type, shape, and size in the world. The universal applicability of our service provides Matterport significant scale and reach across diverse verticals and any geography. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base had grown approximately 39% to over 701,000 subscribers from 503,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2021, with our digital twins reaching more than 170 countries. We have digitized more than 28 billion square feet of space across multiple industries, representing significant scale and growth over the rest of the market.
As we continue to transform buildings into data worldwide, we are extending our spatial data platform to further transform property planning, development, management and intelligence for our subscribers across industries to become the de facto building and business intelligence engine for the built world. We believe the demand for spatial data and resulting insights for enterprises, businesses and institutions across industries, including real estate, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), retail, insurance and government, will continue to grow rapidly.
We believe digitization and datafication represent a tremendous greenfield opportunity for growth across this massive category and asset class. From the early stages of design and development to marketing, operations, insurance and building repair and maintenance, our platform’s software and technology provide subscribers critical tools and insights to drive cost savings, increase revenues and optimally manage their buildings and spaces. We believe that hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized utilization and operating efficiencies in the built world can be unlocked through the power of our spatial data platform. Our platform and data solutions have universal applicability across industries and building categories, giving Matterport a significant advantage as we can address the entirety of this large market opportunity and increase the value of what we believe to be the largest asset class in the world.
With a demonstrated track record of delivering value to our subscribers, our offerings include software subscription, data licensing, services and product hardware. As of December 31, 2022, our subscriber base included over 24% of Fortune 1000 companies, with less than 10% of our total revenue generated from our top 10 subscribers. We expect more than 80% of our revenue to come from our software subscription and data license solutions by 2025. Our innovative 3D capture products, the Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras, have played an integral part in shaping the 3D building and property visualization ecosystem. The Pro2 and Pro3 Cameras have driven adoption of our solutions and have generated the unique high-quality and scaled data set that has enabled Cortex, our proprietary AI software engine, to become the pioneering engine for digital twin creation. With this data advantage initially spurred by the Pro2 Camera, we have developed a capture device agnostic platform that scales and can generate new building and property insights for our subscribers across industries and geographies.
We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022. Our ability to retain and grow the subscription revenue generated by our existing subscribers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We track our performance in this area by measuring our net dollar expansion rate from the same set of customers across comparable periods. Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Today, the vast majority of buildings and spaces remain undigitized. We estimate our current serviceable addressable market includes approximately 1.3 billion spaces worldwide, primarily from the real estate and travel and hospitality sectors. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, we are continuing to penetrate the global building stock and expand our footprint across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. We estimate our total addressable market to be more than 4 billion buildings and 20 billion spaces globally, yielding a more than $240 billion market opportunity. We believe that as Matterport’s unique spatial data library and property data services continue to grow, this opportunity could increase to more than $1 trillion based on the size of the building stock and the untapped value creation available to buildings worldwide. The constraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced and accelerated the importance of our scaled 3D capture solution that we have developed for diverse industries and markets over the past decade. 
Our Spatial Data Platform
Overview
Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.
As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.
Key elements of our spatial data platform include:
•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.
•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world. 
•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.
Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.
Ubiquitous Capture
Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.
The Matterport platform is designed to work with a wide range of LiDAR, spherical, 3D and 360 cameras, as well as smartphones, to suit the capture needs of all of our subscribers. This provides the flexibility to capture a space of any size, scale, and complexity, at anytime and anywhere.
•Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3’s ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.
•Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.
•360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.
•LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.
•Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport’s smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.
Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)
With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.
The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights
Matterport Runs on Cortex
Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.
Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.
•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-
driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.
•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.
•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.
•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.
Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights
Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.
In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.
Extensible Platform Ecosystem
Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. The versatility of our spatial data platform and extensive enterprise software development kit and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) has allowed us to develop a robust global ecosystem of channels and partners that extend the Matterport value proposition by geography and vertical market. We intend to continue to deploy a broad set of workflow integrations with our partners and their subscribers to promote an integrated Matterport solution across our target markets. We are also developing a third-party software marketplace to extend the power of our spatial data platform with easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access Matterport software add-ons. The marketplace enables developers to build new applications and spatial data mining tools, enhance the Matterport 3D experience, and create new productivity and property management tools that supplement our core offerings. These value-added capabilities created by third-party developers enable a scalable new revenue stream, with Matterport sharing the subscription and services revenue from each add-on that is deployed to subscribers through the online marketplace. The network effects of our platform ecosystem contributes to the growth of our business, and we believe that it will continue to bolster future growth by enhancing subscriber stickiness and user engagement.

In addition, the combination of our ability to turn data into insights with incremental data from new data captures by our subscribers enables Matterport to develop features for subscribers to our platform. We were a first mover in building a spatial data library for the built world, and our leadership in gathering and deriving insights from data continues to compound and the relevance of those insights attracts more new subscribers.
•Massive spatial data library as the raw material for valuable property insights. The scale of our spatial data library is a significant advantage in deriving insights for our subscribers. Our spatial data library serves as vital ground truth for Cortex, enabling Matterport to create powerful 3D digital twins using a wide range of camera technology, including low-cost digital and smartphone cameras. As of December 31, 2022, our data came from approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet. As a result, we have taken property insights and analytics to new levels, benefiting subscribers across various industries. For example, facilities managers significantly reduce the time needed to create building layouts, leading to a significant decrease in the cost of site surveying and as-built modeling. AEC subscribers use the analytics of each as-built space to streamline documentation and collaborate with ease.
•Global reach and scale. We are focused on continuing to expand our AI-powered spatial data platform worldwide. We have a significant presence in North America, Europe and Asia, with leadership teams and a go-to-market infrastructure in each of these regions.

Matterport is democratizing the 3D capture experience, making high-fidelity and high-accuracy 3D digital twins readily available for any building type and any subscriber need in the property life cycle. While there are other 3D capture solution providers, very few can produce true, dimensionally accurate 3D results, and fewer still can automatically create a final product in photorealistic 3D, and at global scale. This expansive capture technology offering would not be possible without our rich spatial data library available to train the AI-powered Cortex engine to automatically generate accurate digital twins from photos captured with a smartphone or 360 camera.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe that Matterport has tremendous growth potential ahead. After securing market leading positions in a variety of geographies and vertical markets, we have demonstrated our repeatable value proposition and the ability of our sales growth model to scale. The magnitude of our total addressable market is so large that even with leading market share, we believe our penetration rates today are a small fraction of the opportunity for Matterport. With a mature and tested go-to-market playbook and team in place, we are focused on scaling execution across a carefully selected set of growth vectors. These include:
•Scale the enterprise across industry verticals. Matterport will continue to drive subscriber growth by expanding use cases and introducing new applications. We are particularly focused on acquiring and retaining enterprise subscribers. With our massive spatial data library and pioneering AI-powered capabilities, we pride ourselves on our ability to deliver value across the property lifecycle to subscribers from various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. Going forward, we will continue to improve our proprietary data library and AI-powered platform to address the workflows of the industries we serve, while expanding our solutions and reaching new industries such as manufacturing and oil and gas. We also plan to increase investments in industry-specific sales and marketing initiatives to increase sales efficiency and drive subscriber and recurring revenue growth, particularly from large enterprise subscribers.
•Expand internationally. The global building stock, with an estimated $327 trillion in total property value, remains largely undigitized today as we estimate that less than 0.1% is penetrated by digital transformation. With the vast majority of the world’s buildings outside of the United States, we expect significant opportunities in pursuing the digitization and datafication of the building stock worldwide. We use a “land and expand” model to capitalize on the potential for geographic expansion. As of December 31, 2022, we served subscribers in more than 170 countries, and we will seek to further penetrate these existing geographies in order to add their unique spatial data to our platform. This creates a powerful network effect that we believe will allow us to expand further into under-penetrated countries and unlock additional properties and spaces. With multiple sales attachment points and a global marketing effort, we believe that we can further penetrate enterprises and businesses worldwide through channel partnerships and direct sales.
•Invest in research and development. We will continue to invest in research and development to improve our Cortex AI-powered software engine, expand our solutions portfolio, and support seamless integration of our platform with third-party systems. We plan to concentrate on in-house innovation and expect to consider acquisitions on an opportunistic basis. We have a robust pipeline of new and expanding product releases. For example, in May 2020, we launched Matterport for iPhone, which gave every recent iPhone owner the ability to capture and collaborate on 3D spaces, and resulted in a significant number of new subscribers and new spaces under management. In April 2021, Matterport announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. We see significant potential for future subscriber growth as we release more products and create additional upselling opportunities. We will also strengthen our AI and ML capabilities as we enlarge our spatial data library, enabling continuous improvement of the fidelity and accuracy of digital twins and enhancing the commercial value from data-driven analytics. In June 2021, Matterport announced a collaboration with Facebook AI (now known as Meta) to release the world’s largest dataset of 3D spaces for academic research and a partnership with Apex, a national provider of advanced store surveys, to enable retail brands across the U.S. and Canada to access, collect and evaluate building 
data and information. In August 2021, we announced a new integration with Xactimate that allows property professionals to order a TruePlan of a Matterport 3D model with a single click in Versik’s Xactimate solution. Also in August 2021, we launched Notes, an interactive collaboration and communication tool for its digital twins to unlock big productivity gains for teams. In October 2021, we launched Matterport for Mobile, making 3D capture freely available to more than one billion Android mobile device users worldwide. These investments may impact our operating profitability in the near term, but we expect our operating margins to improve over the long term as we solidify our scale and reach. In January 2022, we completed the acquisition of Enview, Inc., a pioneer in scalable artificial intelligence (AI) for 3D spatial data, which will accelerate our development of artificial intelligence algorithms to identify natural and man-made features in geospatial data using various techniques, including deep learning, neural networks and physics-based modeling. In February 2022, we introduced Axis, a new hands-free motor mount for precision 3D capture for smartphones to enable a hands-free solution that produces reliable, high-fidelity results with just a click of a button. In April 2022, we made Matterport Axis available for purchase, enabling hands-free precision 3D capture for smartphones. In August 2022, we introduced major updates to our industry-leading digital twin cloud platform. Matterport has reimagined the cloud software platform that creates, publishes, and manages digital twins of buildings and spaces of any size or shape, indoors or outdoors. All of these new capabilities integrate seamlessly so customers can securely create immersive environments for their employees, customers and partners to collaborate and explore. We created a new workgroup collaboration framework called Views to enable groups and large organizations to create separate, permissions-based workflows to manage different tasks with different teams such as: virtual inspections, remote training, space planning, personalized virtual tours, and so much more. We have also created new tools called Guided Tours and Tags to elevate the visitor experience that a business user can use to create directed virtual tours of any commercial or residential space tailored to the interest of their visitors, and guided virtual training courses for remote workers. While we plan to concentrate on in-house innovation, we may also pursue acquisitions of products, teams and technologies on an opportunistic basis to further expand the functionality of and use cases for our platform. As with organic research and development, we adopt a long-term perspective in the evaluation of acquisition opportunities in order to ensure sustainable value creation for our customers.
•Expand partner integrations and third-party developer platform. We aim to foster a strong network of partners and developers around our Matterport platform. Through integration with our open, scalable and secure enterprise platform, organizations across numerous industries have been able to automate workflows, enhance subscriber experiences and create custom extensions for high-value vertical applications. For example, in May 2020, we rolled out integration capability with Autodesk to help construction teams streamline documentation across workflows and collaborate virtually. In July 2021, by partnering with PTC, a computer software company, we offer a joint solution that gives customers a highly visual and interactive way to deliver digital content onto the environments capture by our platform. Going forward, we plan to develop additional strategic partnerships with leading software providers to enable more effective integrations and enlarge our marketplace of third-party applications. In November 2021, we launched a new plugin for Autodesk Revit customers, allowing them to upload a Matterport Scan-to-BIM file into Autodesk Revit and start creating and managing information on a construction or design project across its different stages. In December 2021, we extended the availability of the Matterport platform in AWS Marketplace so that AWS customers will be able to access Matterport’s digital twin technology with AWS add-ons that potentially increase the value of digitization. In June 2022, we partnered with CGS Partner to deliver virtual training solutions for front-line workers across the Fortune 500. The companies will combine the CGS TeamworkARTM platform with Matterport’s industry-leading digital twins to help customers train workers faster, increase productivity, and reduce costs by training workforces remotely using an exact digital replica of the work environment in immersive 3D. In July 2022, we partnered with Burns & McDonnell. With this relationship, Burns & McDonnell customers can use the Matterport Digital Twin Platform, including software services and hardware, to optimize construction expansion and maintenance projects. The collaboration equips businesses in the energy, utilities, and manufacturing industries with a continuous digital, visual documentation solution that improves operations, enhances collaboration, and increases safety in each project stage. 
Our Subscribers
We primarily sell to enterprises, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small- and medium-sized businesses. Our subscriber base is global and spans numerous categories, as we have expanded beyond the residential and commercial real estate verticals to AEC, travel and hospitality, repair and insurance, and industrial, facilities and retail. As of December 31, 2022, we served over 701,000 subscribers across these verticals, and we are building significant market share in each of them. We have long-standing relationships with many of the largest companies in these industries. The biggest companies in each of the verticals we serve represent billions of square feet of property that could become part of Matterport’s global 
spatial data library. We expect our global subscriber base to continue to grow rapidly as Matterport continues to establish itself as the digital standard of the built world and an integral component of managing a building’s lifecycle.
To help accelerate subscriber adoption, in May 2020, we introduced Matterport for iPhone, which gives every recent iPhone owner the ability to capture and collaborate on 3D spaces. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In October 2021, we launched Matterport for Mobile, making 3D capture freely available to more than one billion Android mobile device users worldwide. Smartphone capture is an important innovation driving significant adoption and the democratization of 3D capture across industries while also appealing to homeowners and tenants, property hosts and agents, and property managers, further expanding our subscriber base, engagement and entrenchment.
Our Go-to-Market Strategy
Matterport’s fundamental go-to-market model is built upon a subscription first, capture device agnostic approach. We have invested aggressively to unlock a scalable subscription flywheel for subscriber adoption with multiple on-ramps to Matterport and a variety of ways to expand subscriber engagement. We will continue to invest in these subscription first on-ramps and cross-sell opportunities to accelerate our growth. The key benefit to this approach is to offer our current and future subscribers a frictionless, cost effective way to start and then scale with Matterport. Our subscription plans are priced from free for a single space captured with a smartphone device to custom plans tailored to large scale enterprise subscriber needs.
We have developed a scalable go-to-market process built upon the strength of our platform and an efficient approach that opens our sales funnel to reach across industries and geographies, targeted at large enterprise subscribers, small businesses and mid-market opportunities. We have deployed a multi-channel sales approach to efficiently reach each of our subscriber segments, from small businesses to enterprise-level subscribers. In general, we employ a direct sales approach for subscribers with the largest number of spaces or square feet under management, a channel partner approach to expand our reach where channel partners offer strong networks in particular verticals or geographies, and an online self-service approach for a frictionless, convenient entry point to Matterport for all potential subscribers. This structure allows us to effectively and efficiently market our solutions to businesses of all sizes across the world.
•Online direct sales and downloads. We are increasing our investment across our online distribution channel to make it easy and frictionless for our subscribers to get started and grow with Matterport. Our software, a variety of subscription plans, and multiple capture device options are available online for purchase today. Our Matterport for iPhone capture solution requires just a simple app download and free account sign up to get started, enabling enterprises, small businesses and individual property owners to experience the Matterport solution in just minutes.
•Direct sales. With sales teams distributed across the United States, Europe and Asia, we strive to increase adoption among large enterprise subscribers across various end markets, including residential and commercial real estate, facilities management, retail, AEC, insurance and repair, and travel and hospitality. Matterport’s direct sales teams have domain expertise in specific industries, and are organized by verticals in order to address the unique needs of our subscribers. We also have a dedicated technical support team that works closely with subscribers to ensure that the Matterport application programming interface can be integrated seamlessly with each enterprise system.
•Subscriber success. Our account management teams work directly with our subscribers and our sales teams to onboard subscribers, articulate the value and scope of our services and drive engagement and cross-selling of our products and services.
•Channel sales. In addition to our online and direct sales efforts, we maintain a robust ecosystem of channel partnerships, which enable us to reach a wider network of enterprise and small business subscribers. Our channel partners are technology and systems integrators with domain expertise in key industries and deep understanding of the unique requirements of their respective markets. Training and education are a cornerstone of our partnerships, and we work closely with our channel partners to ensure they are knowledgeable in addressing our subscribers’ requirements. For example, our channel partners help make our 3D cameras available to subscribers in a wide range of industries and geographies. Our partners in the specialized immersive technology space introduce real estate and travel and hospitality subscribers to Matterport’s spatial data platform to address their unique 3D capturing needs. Specialty construction contractors connect with Matterport through their suppliers to improve the efficiency of construction projects with the help of digital twins.
Competition
We primarily compete with traditional methods of managing buildings and spaces, including 2D photography, paper-based building plans, labor-intensive computer-aided design drawings, and other static methods of visualizing and analyzing properties. We are leading a transformation from offline to an online, data-driven approach to interacting with buildings and spaces. Matterport is a fully automated end-to-end system that turns buildings into robust spatial data and digital twins. Our solution has been developed over the years to deliver consistent, precision results for any building or space. This universality differentiates Matterport from vendors that offer industry-specific and building-specific point solutions geared toward narrow parts of the market.
These point solutions address only a portion of the functionality and value that the Matterport platform provides. For example, traditional virtual tour companies create pre-recorded video tours and photo montages with background music to promote properties online. Such vendors do not capture or produce 3D spatial data for analysis and property insights. Point solution providers also offer targeted solutions for specific markets such as specialized solutions for surveying daily documentation for construction projects, and insurance claims documentation and processing. However, these point solutions do not represent a comprehensive and extensible platform solution with broad applicability to all industries, geographies and vertical markets. Matterport provides a unique platform solution expressly designed to fulfill the needs of managing every building type across the property lifecycle.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•Scale of data. Our vast spatial data library is a significant competitive advantage. Our spatial data library enhances our solutions and improves the accuracy, dependability and insights available to our subscribers.
•Automation and scale of spaces under management. The ability to consistently and accurately create a digital twin of any building or space at scale, thousands of buildings at a time, requires a unique combination of spatial data, data science, and automation of the entire digitization process.
•Capture ubiquity. The ability to easily capture spatial data removes friction to adoption and scale. We have created a capture technology platform to democratize 3D capture and eliminate camera hardware dependencies to make it easy and affordable for anyone to adopt Matterport. For example, the Matterport for iPhone launch in May 2020 contributed significantly to our subscriber growth. Easier adoption unlocks the flywheel with our ubiquitous capture strategy.
•Open ecosystem. Creating an open ecosystem for our platform is increasingly key to our strategy. An open ecosystem enables enterprises from various verticals to run on top of Matterport’s spatial data layer. Our third party software marketplace has created a platform where developers and partners can tap into our APIs and incorporate Matterport into their own workflows.
•Brand recognition. A trusted brand attracts and maintains subscribers. As of December 31, 2022, we served over 701,000 subscribers and we believe we are the clear market leader. We will continue to leverage our leading position and increasing brand awareness to grow our subscriber base and spaces under management. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 
Intellectual Property
Our ability to drive innovation in our business depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and through non-disclosure agreements with our commercial partners and vendors. Unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 54 issued and 37 pending patent applications and 50 issued trademarks and 25 pending trademark applications.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Our employees are critical to our success. Our employees are guided by our mission to fundamentally improve the way people understand and interact with the physical world. We are part of a diverse global community, and we aim to reflect that diversity within our team. We believe diversity and inclusion foster a collaborative culture, which fuels our 
vision to make every space more valuable and accessible. We proactively seek feedback and guidance from our employees (Matterpeeps), whom we see as our partners in building a strong culture. As of December 31, 2022, we had 590 full-time employees. We also engage consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Our human capital goals are based on maximizing employee value through talent acquisition, employee onboarding, talent management, total rewards, the employee experience and company culture, and internal communications. As a global company, we are committed to creating a diverse, multicultural workforce reflective of our users, customers and the communities where we live and work.
Key areas of focus with respect to human capital include:
Culture and Engagement. We believe it is important to listen to our employees and develop our people. We proactively seek feedback and guidance from our employees, whom we see as our partners in building a strong culture. Maintaining such culture in a remote environment remains a priority in our human capital management programs. The “Three Dimensions of Matterport” are foundational to our culture and our success:
•Be a Leader: Generate Energy, Create Clarity, Be Accountable
•Be Inclusive: Seek Different Perspectives, Foster an Open Dialog, Create a Sense of Belonging
•Be the Customer: Understand Them, Delight Them, Help Them Win
The “Three Dimensions” guide our human capital initiatives and objectives and provide the basis by which we collect feedback and assess the effectiveness of our culture. We also encourage our leadership group to check in with their teams to gather input on how best to improve retention, productivity, and engagement. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and our culture. Employee Resource Groups, a platform for courageous conversations, company wide recognition and celebrations of important cultural events, and an open forum to ask questions of leadership are all important aspects of our culture.
Diversity and Inclusion. We are committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace rooted in trust, fairness, empathy, respect, transparency and accountability. We focus on advancing diversity at all levels across the organization, including the representation of women and minorities in leadership positions and to track our efforts, we have built a diversity and inclusion dashboard, monitoring training and promotions. We provide diversity and inclusion training courses to all employees and aim to develop our existing talent through our talent development program for underrepresented groups entitled EMERGE (Elevating Matterpeeps’ Empowerment, Retention, Growth, and Excellence). Participants learn from internal and external thought leaders in robust sessions outlining the importance of mentorship, choosing the right allies, elevating your executive presence, demonstrating achievements effectively, and much more. To promote an inclusive workplace our six Employee Resource Groups hold robust discussions and build community through panels and other activities that are reflective of their various heritage months and holidays. We believe diversity and inclusion foster a collaborative culture, which fuels our vision to make every space more valuable and accessible.
Talent Development. We look to attract and retain the best talent to help Matterport deliver against our strategies. We prioritize career growth and leadership development because growing our talent and building our capabilities supports our retention efforts and helps us establish a strong foundation for long-term success. We firmly believe that employee engagement is an integral component of our success. To further develop and retain talent, we also have structured review cycles for employees and robust mentoring programs. We run quarterly performance check-ins to ensure employees have the opportunity to get actionable feedback from their managers. We maintain our ongoing training and development of our employees through programs such as our monthly internal training program, and offer employees the opportunity to utilize LinkedIn Learning and a full course catalog from our internal Learning & Development team.
Total Rewards and well-being. We are committed to delivering a comprehensive compensation and benefits program that provides support for all of our employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, including offering market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire. In addition, we provide an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, to foster a strong sense of ownership and engage our employees in being committed to our long-term success; eligibility varies by country in which we operate. Our full-time employees are eligible to participate in our comprehensive benefits package including a holistic suite of well-health and welfare benefits for employees, retirement, charitable gift matching through MatterportCares, and various others. In addition, we provide flexible time off to our exempt employees. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits vary regionally due to local regulations and 
preferences. Our goal is to facilitate the attraction and retention of top talent while balancing the interests of our stakeholders.
We recognize the importance of supporting our employees’ overall wellness and generally refer to our “Benefits” as “Wellness”. We focus on employees Physical wellness, Emotional/mental wellness, and Financial wellness. We are committed to maintaining a positive, safe, healthy work environment for all our employees, and require compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations governing working conditions, working hours, fair wages, and compensation.
Sustainability 
While Matterport is in the early stages of our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) journey, we have always been mindful of our responsibility to act in an environmentally and socially conscious manner and are committed to continuous improvement. We have engaged Nasdaq ESG Advisory to assess our current ESG policies and initiatives and those going back since 2021. We also conducted a survey of our key stakeholders, including our employees, to identify the key ESG priorities for Matterport. As part of our focus to deliver strong financial results in a way that respects our employees and the environments and communities in which we operate, we will consider these ESG stakeholder viewpoints when evaluating investment and operational decisions. Doing so can help our business have a positive impact on the planet, the people whose lives we touch, and our bottom line. To ensure we follow best practices, our reporting is aligned with the requirements of leading ESG frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).
Location 
We are a Delaware corporation with corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and a globally distributed workforce. Since March 2020, the vast majority of our workforce has been working remotely. The remote work environment has given us an advantage in attracting top talent from around the world without being tied to specific locations. We recruit and hire employees globally based on a range of factors, including the available talent pool, the type of work being performed, the relative cost of labor, regulatory requirements and costs, among other considerations. 
Our Values and Commitment to Inclusion 
We understand that achieving a diverse and inclusive workplace is a journey that requires action, trust, fairness, empathy, respect, transparency and accountability. We strive to be diverse and inclusive in every aspect of our business. Our success depends on it. We don’t just value differences. We prefer them. 
We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and our culture. Employee Resource Groups, a platform for Courageous Conversations, company wide recognition and celebrations of important cultural events, and an open forum to ask questions of leadership are all important aspects of our culture. 
Privacy and Data Security 
We collect, use, store, transfer, share or otherwise process a variety of personal information in the ordinary course of business. As such, we are subject to a number of U.S. and international laws, regulations, and industry standards governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing, processing and protection of personal information and other sensitive data. Such laws and regulations may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules.
In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, storage, transfer, sharing, or other processing of personal information could apply to our operations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. These laws include, without limitation, the CCPA, CPRA, VCDPA, and COCPA.
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the UK GDPR are law instruments seeking to strengthen individuals’ fundamental rights and to facilitate business by clarifying rules for companies and public bodies by setting a high standard for the protection of personal data and by imposing a strict data protection compliance regime. The GDPR and the UK GDPR apply to the processing of personal data and the term ‘processing’ is defined broadly to include collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, 
retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, transfer, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data. In addition, as regards transfers of personal data outside the EEA and/or the UK, a recent decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union and the related regulatory guidance may impact/limit our ability to conduct such transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions. 
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate or failure to comply with such legislation and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Government Regulations
We are subject to various laws, regulations and permitting requirements of federal, state and local authorities, including those related to health and safety; environmental, anti-corruption and export controls. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations and permitting requirements.
Export and Trade Matters
We are subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain countries or territories targeted by U.S. comprehensive sanctions, including currently Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine. Changes in these laws or regulations, or shifts in the approach to their enforcement or scope, could impact our ability to sell our product to existing or potential customers. In particular, sanctions imposed by the U.S., EU, UK, and other jurisdictions in response to Russian activities in Ukraine, and any counter-sanctions enacted in response, could restrict our ability to operate, generate or collect revenue in certain other countries, such as Russia, which could adversely affect our business. 
In addition, our products are subject to export regulations that can involve significant compliance and administrative time to address. In recent years the United States government has a renewed focus on export matters. Our current and future products may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs. We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business.
Our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to comply may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant penalties, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive. Despite our compliance efforts and activities we cannot assure compliance by our employees or representatives for which we may be held responsible, and any such violation could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Seasonality
Our capture services tend to generate higher revenue following the seasonal pattern of the U.S. residential real estate industry, with volume increases typically occurring in the spring and summer months compared to the fall and winter months. Such seasonal impacts have in the past and may in the future be reduced or changed due to changes in the composition of subscribers, uses of the Matterport digital twins, structure of subscription plans.
