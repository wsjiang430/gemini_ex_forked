 Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions throughout the United States, Australia, Europe and Canada. We make transportation safer, smarter and more connected through our integrated, data-driven solutions, including toll and violations management, title and registration services, automated safety and traffic enforcement and commercial parking management. We bring together vehicles, hardware, software, data, and people to solve transportation challenges for customers around the world, including fleet owners such as rental car companies (“RACs”) and fleet management companies (“FMCs”), governments, universities, parking operators, healthcare facilities, transportation hubs and other violation-issuing authorities.
 Our vision is to develop and use technology and data intelligence to make transportation safer, smarter and more connected.
 Segments
Our solutions are offered through three segments: (i) Commercial Services, (ii) Government Solutions and (iii) Parking Solutions.
 Commercial Services

Our Commercial Services segment generated approximately $326.0 million in revenue for 2022, or approximately 44.0% of our total revenue. We believe that our Commercial Services segment is the market-leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in North America. In Europe, our Commercial Services segment provides violations processing through Euro Parking Collection plc (“EPC”) and consumer tolling services through Pagatelia S.L.U. (“Pagatelia”). We have long-standing relationships with, among others, the three largest RACs in the United States, Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, Inc. and The Hertz Corporation. We also have relationships with key European RACs and the five largest FMCs in the United States. Through our established relationships with individual tolling authorities throughout the United States, we provide an automated and outsourced administrative solution for our customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers and benefits to the tolling and issuing authorities. Our toll and violations management solutions help ensure timely payment for tolls and violations incurred by our customers’ vehicles and perform timely transfers of liability on our customers’ behalf, and billing and collecting from the driver as applicable. We also manage regional toll transponder installation and vehicle association, a critical and highly complex process for RAC and FMC customers, to ensure that the transponder (and corresponding toll transactions) are associated with the correct vehicle.
Government Solutions
Our Government Solutions segment generated approximately $336.7 million in revenue for 2022, or approximately 45.4% of our total revenue. We believe our Government Solutions segment is the market-leading provider of automated safety solutions in the United States, Canada and Australia to state and local governments. In the United States, we provide government agencies with road safety cameras to detect and process traffic violations for red-light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes. Our proprietary hardware and software technologies provide government agencies the information, data, and automated end-to-end administrative capabilities to enforce traffic violations through photo enforcement. On behalf of our customers, we install, maintain, and manage automated safety solution hardware and software that processes event data, applies customer specific rules and connects a traffic violation to the responsible driver or vehicle owner. Additionally, upon law enforcement’s determination that a violation has occurred, we offer an “end-to-end” solution to manage the citation mailing, billing, and other administrative tasks on behalf of our customers. For many international customers, we design, engineer, and maintain roadside photo enforcement technology, including both hardware and software, which is sold or licensed to government agencies and often maintained with maintenance contracts to support the technology.
Parking Solutions
 
We formed our Parking Solutions segment after our acquisition of T2 Systems Parent Corporation (“T2 Systems”) in December 2021. This segment generated approximately $79.0 million in revenue for 2022, or

approximately 10.6% of our total revenue. Our Parking Solutions segment is a North American leader of end-to-end commercial parking management solutions in the markets we serve. This segment serves over 2,000 customers in the university, municipal, healthcare and commercial operator markets. Our proprietary software and hardware technologies provides our customers with solutions needed to manage and monetize parking and enforcement operations. In 2022, we processed over 163 million transactions using our various parking solutions systems. Each need requires technology solutions for parking access and revenue control, single- and multi-space pay stations, integrated physical and mobile payments, back-office parking rate management, permit issuance and management, online citation payment, event parking, occupancy, and back-office management of violations, amongst other requirements.
Markets and Competition
 There is no single competitor that provides a similarly broad suite of solutions across our business segments. However, in our Government Solutions segment, we face competition in certain automated safety solutions from other vendors in the areas of red-light, school bus, speed and bus lane photo enforcement. In our Commercial Services segment, we face competition from both our own customers, who may choose to invest in their own internal solutions, and vendors offering or seeking to offer new technologies or financial models, and we must continue to innovate to remain competitive. In Parking Solutions, we face competition from a variety of segment-specific competitors in our markets in the United States and Canada.
 Tolling
The tolling industry is highly fragmented and complex, as it is comprised of more than 80 tolling operators with specific coverage regions and disparate technology platforms, processing requirements and business rules. We believe that as state and local governments fund a growing list of infrastructure, maintenance and construction projects, there will be an increase in the number of toll roads, including new express and high occupancy lanes in urban areas. We expect this trend will also increase utilization of dynamic tolling, which allows toll rates to fluctuate based on traffic trends and real-time congestion. In addition, 95% of toll road transactions in the United States are cashless or all-electronic payment. We believe that these trends create sizable opportunities for us to expand our tolling market presence while developing relationships with tolling authorities.
Commercial Fleet
Our Commercial Services customers consist of RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners. The approximately $36 billion United States RAC industry is highly consolidated, with three companies, with which we have long-standing relationships, accounting for a significant majority of United States RAC revenues in 2022. We believe that the above-mentioned trends toward the use of toll roads additionally create significant opportunities for us to expand our fleet market presence while developing relationships with both new and existing RACs, FMCs, and other fleet consumers.
 Automated Safety
As cities and municipalities wrestle with the evolving challenges of managing traffic congestion, road safety and accessible transportation networks, automated enforcement solutions continue to serve as an effective tool for comprehensive safety and mobility initiatives. In 2020, the Congressional Research Service found cameras to be an effective tool for law enforcement and other agencies to reduce the number of traffic-related violations, collisions, injuries and fatalities, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials has called on states to support greater use of automated speed enforcement. New York City’s Automated Speed Enforcement Program 2014-2020 Report, noted a 72% average reduction in dangerous speeding at its fixed camera locations. Additionally, programs like Vision Zero, a collaborative campaign helping communities reach their goals of eliminating all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, across most major U.S. cities and around the world, are driving capital investment to make meaningful strides in traffic safety. Public attention given to traffic safety issues for drivers, pedestrians, children, bicyclists and law enforcement is intensifying and governments are facing shortfalls in transportation revenue. In this context, smart technology solutions have emerged as an effective and revenue-positive method to address traffic safety issues. We believe that as public focus intensifies, the demand for our Government Solutions offerings will grow as well, and that we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
Parking
 The parking industry consists of a highly fragmented mix of end customers, including universities, municipalities, private operators, healthcare providers and airports, among other industries. These customers each have different parking needs such as off-street parking, on-street parking, permits, enforcement and consumer engagement. T2 Systems has customer relationships with approximately 30% of higher education institutions in its target tiers, according to internal analysis. The broader parking market in which T2 System’s operates – North American municipalities, universities and healthcare providers – represents up to a $4 billion market according to a 2021 market estimate. Parking Solutions market segments are focused on strategies to offset costs in reaction to downturns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and market participants are struggling to attract and retain labor. At the same time, consumers are increasingly willing to adopt mobile solutions to simplify their transportation needs, creating market opportunities to advance self-service options. We believe that technology solutions that provide mobile-first, self-service offerings, improve operational efficiency, reduce reliance on parking-related labor, and commercial models that reduce up-front costs provide solutions for market needs and establish a long-term operating model.

Commercial Services
Toll management solutions
 We provide fully outsourced toll management solutions for our fleet owner customers, including RACs and FMCs, while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers via our established relationships and integrations with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States. This comprehensive network allows RAC and FMC drivers the convenience of using cashless and all-electronic tolls. Additionally, this service helps prevent the liability and business disruption of costly toll violations incurred by vehicles owned by RAC and FMC customers and eliminates their need to manage a nationwide program internally. Our proprietary software technology and hardware allow us to effectively match a toll to the specific RAC or FMC vehicle and driver so that the toll can accurately and reliably be billed and collected on behalf of, or directly from, the RAC or FMC. Toll management solutions accounted for approximately 37.2% of our 2022 revenues.
Violations management solutions
 Our violations management solutions process violations incurred by the drivers of RAC and FMC vehicles by working with more than 8,000 domestic violation-issuing authorities (more than 400 of which we are directly integrated with) to either pay the fine on behalf of the vehicle owner (for which we are able to bill the driver) or to transfer liability directly to the vehicle driver. Vehicle-issued violations include parking and photo enforcement violations. In Europe, we specialize in the identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking and public transport related fees, charges, and penalties issued to foreign registered vehicles or persons on behalf of issuing authorities in 17 European countries. Violation management solutions accounted for approximately 4.6% of our 2022 revenues.
Title and registration solutions
 Our title and registration solutions provide RAC and FMC customers with an integrated, end-to-end solution for managing vehicle titles and registrations and annual renewals. We provide automated title and registration solutions by leveraging connections with individual departments of motor vehicles for electronic title and registration processing in 20 states. Title and registration solutions accounted for approximately 2.2% of our 2022 revenues.
Government Solutions
We serve as a value-add partner to government agencies by providing photo enforcement solutions that promote traffic safety and reduce traffic violations. We work with our customers to identify problematic traffic areas and install, maintain and manage the technology platform needed to capture images or videos of drivers committing traffic violations. Red-light cameras are placed at intersections to capture vehicles running red lights. Similarly, speed safety cameras are used to capture vehicles exceeding speed limits, either on a fixed basis or in a mobile platform, and often in school zones. School bus cameras are fixed to the side of buses to capture vehicles passing school buses with extended stop arms. Finally, bus lane cameras are designed to capture vehicles illegally driving in restricted bus lanes.

For customers of our end-to-end solutions, we automatically send captured events to the designated enforcement agency of the customer, where an authorized individual determines if a violation occurred. Direct service revenue from red-light cameras, speed cameras, school bus cameras and city bus lane cameras accounted for approximately 38.3% of our 2022 revenues. Other segment service revenue consists primarily of ancillary revenue streams, which comprised 3.2% of total revenue. Product sales to customers are not recurring and are dependent on our customers’ needs, and account for 3.9% of total revenue. We expect product sales to be at levels below the preceding three years due to the completion of the New York City camera installation program in 2022
 
Parking Solutions
 Parking Access and Revenue Control
 Our Parking Access and Revenue Control (“PARCS”) technology solutions include both software and hardware offerings which work in concert to help our customers manage their gated, gateless and license plate recognition-based parking lot and parking garage needs. We have installed over 2,500 PARCS lanes to date. Our related software is the industry’s original hosted parking management software, which allows management of our customers’ PARCS solutions from a computer or mobile device.
Pay Stations
 Our pay stations hardware technology has interoperability with over 50 third-party systems, as well as our PARCS and parking enforcement solutions. They are powered by a highly configurable and data driven software technology which supports the enforcement, mobile payments, and back-office and accounting needs of our customers. Our fleet of Pay Stations hardware exceeded 16,800 units at December 31, 2022.
Permits & Enforcement
 Our Permits & Enforcement (“PE”) software technology solutions allow our customers to control who is parking in their facilities and when and where drivers can park using physical or virtual permits, allowing customers to control traffic and maximize their parking-related revenues. This technology also provides enforcement officers with real-time information and custom notifications on their enforcement devices. Citations management features also help to organize fine escalations and notification letters to parking violators.
 Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We take steps to protect new intellectual property to safeguard our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and believe we take appropriate action against infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement, and to identify strategic opportunities.
Our general policy is to seek patent protection for our inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. We own approximately 82 U.S.- and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. Patents expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages.
Our business relies on both internally developed and externally licensed software, as well as internally, externally and co-developed hardware, to operate and provide our systems and deliver our services. We claim copyright on all internally developed software. We generally rely on common law protection for our copyrighted works. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to assure our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software and hardware, we rely on contracts to retain our continued access for our business usage. From time to time, these agreements may expire or be subject to renegotiation.
 We have approximately 214 registrations and pending applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for trademarks and service marks, reflecting our many products and services. These registrations and applications include our historic and acquired brands, as well as Verra Mobility. These marks may have a perpetual life, subject to

periodic renewal and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. We vigorously enforce and protect our marks.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various local, state and national laws, regulations and administrative practices regulating matters such as data privacy, photo enforcement, consumer protection, procurement, licensing requirements, anti-corruption, equal employment, minimum wages, workplace health and safety, human rights and the environment, among others. Our operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, (“USDOT”), the Federal Trade Commission, (“FTC”), the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as comparable international, state and local agencies, including the departments of transportation, departments of motor vehicles, and offices of inspectors general, and laws related to financial and banking regulations. Following the acquisition of EPC, Pagatelia and Redflex Holdings Limited, now known as Redflex Holdings Pty Ltd. (“Redflex”), and in connection with our European expansion efforts, we are subject to laws, regulations and administrative practices addressing many of these same matters in Europe, Australia and Canada, including those specifically relating to accessing and use of information obtained from vehicle licensing authorities, as well as European regulations to traffic enforcement and collections and other financial and banking regulations.
As part of our business, we collect, receive, process, use, transmit, disclose, and retain information relating to identifiable individuals (“personal information”) and, therefore, are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of personal information, including but not limited to the U.S. Driver Privacy Protection Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union (the “E.U.”), the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Australia Privacy Act of 1988, New Zealand’s Privacy Act of 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and other national and state privacy laws. We are also subject to similar restrictions and audit requirements pursuant to our contracts with the organizations from which we gain access to personal information, such as departments of motor vehicles and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System. Privacy laws and regulations are constantly evolving and changing, are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries and state and local jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in foreign countries, or as U.S. federal or state law changes, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements will increase. Laws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have also come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental authorities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for increased regulation and changes in industry practices. Our foreign photo enforcement programs are also subject to regulation in the various countries in which we operate.
 Automated photo enforcement camera programs in the United States are typically regulated at the state and local level, not the federal level. Since 2010, there have been over 1,500 pieces of legislation introduced nationwide related to the photo enforcement industry. In general, photo enforcement is administrated by state, provincial or local government agencies, under either state enabling legislation or under home rule authority established under the relevant state constitution. Where enabling legislation is not required, local ordinances impose further restrictions within a given jurisdiction. Whether in a state requiring enabling legislation or in home-rule states where municipalities pass ordinances permitting photo enforcement, if the legislation or ordinance is subsequently repealed, not renewed if required, or if the authority for a local ordinance is revoked, photo enforcement activities would stop.
State and local regulation affects our Commercial Services segment as well, particularly with respect to tolling. Over the past few years, bills have been introduced in multiple states to limit whether and how much RACs can charge their customers for the use of a toll transponder, limit the administrative penalties and fees that can be assessed for processing tolls, and/or impose increased disclosure requirements on RACs with respect to tolling or violation processing fees. In addition, there has been an increase in interest and greater focus on RAC tolling programs from state Attorneys General related to tolling issues from a consumer protection perspective.
 Our Government Solutions customers are typically government agencies, and our operations within this segment are therefore subject to various procurement laws pertaining to gifts and entertainment, payments of commissions and contingency fees, conflicts of interest, licensing and permitting requirements and other matters. These laws are overseen by different government agencies, depending on the jurisdiction, including departments of procurements services, contracting offices and offices of inspector general.

To successfully navigate this regulatory landscape, we have a dedicated government relations team that works with national, state and local policymakers, often with the help of lobbyists and consultants, to track and help support favorable camera-enforcement safety and toll-related legislative outcomes. Through this network, we have a presence in most states in which our Government Solutions and Commercial Services segments do business. These lobbying activities are subject to state and local regulations and registration requirements.
In connection with the installation of photo enforcement systems, we or our customers routinely obtain permits from various permitting authorities. As a government contractor providing photo enforcement services directly or through subcontractors (including design, engineering, construction, installation, and maintenance) in various locations throughout the United States and internationally, we are at times required to obtain licenses regarding general contracting, performance of engineering services, performance of electrical work, performance of private investigative work and processing license plate and related personal information, and periodically receive notices from regulatory authorities regarding these matters and inquiring as to our compliance with the applicable state, local and foreign laws and regulations.
We believe we are in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate our business. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, fines, penalties, revocation of permits or licenses, cessation of operations in a given jurisdiction and other adverse consequences. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.
 Human Capital Management
 
Our employees are critical to our success as a leading provider of smart mobility solutions. To continue delivering high-quality solutions to our customers and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is critical that we continue to attract, retain and develop diverse groups of talented individuals at all levels of our organization.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,570 employees, comprised of 1,396 full-time employees and 174 part-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 1,032 were located in the United States and 364 were located internationally. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, except for our 20 employees in Staten Island, New York. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have not experienced a strike or other significant work stoppage.
 
Talent Acquisition and Development
 
Our success depends upon attracting, retaining and developing a diverse group of talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals, contribute their own unique perspective and skill set and create long-term value for our stockholders. We have implemented purposeful hiring strategies that include opportunities for internal mobility and promotion and an employee referral program, both of which we believe will further strengthen our growing employee base and promote retention at our Company. We have a multifaceted talent development framework that includes functional training, management training and targeted development problems, such as our Six Sigma training that aims to further enhance operational skills in our Government Solutions business unit. We also develop our employees through an annual performance review and assessment process that incorporates a dual-performance rating system and provides each employee with concrete, actionable feedback that will enable them to succeed at our Company.
Compensation and Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s and individual performance, and to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentives for both short-term and long-term performance. In addition to cash compensation, we offer employees benefits such as health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, accident insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave and a company-sponsored 401(k) plan, and related benefits for non-U.S. employees. For key leadership positions, we also provide compensation packages that include annual incentive bonuses and long-term equity awards.
Employee Engagement
 
We seek employees who collaborate and value differences, think and act globally, foster an engaging climate, and recognize and develop others. We engage and survey our employee population to gather insight, feedback, and data about employees’ engagement, workplace experiences, and manager effectiveness. Survey results inform and support corporate, business unit, department, and team action plans, with the goal of enhancing workplace satisfaction and overall employee well-being and effectiveness.
