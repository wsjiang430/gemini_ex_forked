During 2022, we continued to enable access to our high-performance GHz NMR technology. Four additional GHz NMR systems, representing the top end of our portfolio, were accepted by our customers (two 1.2 GHz and two 1.0 GHz). This was supported by the launch of a unique single-story 1.0 GHz system that significantly reduces footprint, weight, and ceiling height requirements and cuts liquid helium consumption by two-thirds. In the applied markets, we made significant progress with our new solutions that are built on the benchtop Fourier NMR platform, such as reaction monitoring in chemical and pharmaceutical research as well as GxP solutions for quality control in manufacturing. In our clinical segment, we launched an NMR assay for Research Use Only for molecular phenomics research on blood samples from 'Long COVID' patients. In addition, the introduction of the new MRI portfolio for preclinical imaging markets eliminates the need for liquid helium or nitrogen refills while providing high field sensitivity and resolution for advanced MRI and PET/MR research.
BSI BioSpin Segment’s instruments are based on the following technology platforms:
•NMR—Nuclear magnetic resonance; 
 •EPR—Electron paramagnetic resonance; 
 •MRI—Magnetic resonance imaging; 
 •MPI—Magnetic particle imaging; 
 •PET—Positron emission tomography; 
 •SPECT—Single photon emission tomography; and 
 •CT—Computed tomography. 
 NMR is a qualitative and quantitative analytical technique that is used to determine the molecular structure and purity of a sample. Molecules are placed in a magnetic field and give off a radio frequency signature that is recorded by a sensitive detector. Analysis software helps to determine the molecular structure of the sample. The NMR technique is used in academia, by pharmaceutical, biotechnology, food and beverage and clinical companies, and by other industrial users in life science and material science research.
EPR is a process of absorption of microwave radiation by paramagnetic ions or molecules with at least one unpaired electron that spins in the presence of a static magnetic field. EPR detects unpaired electrons unambiguously, whereas other techniques can only provide indirect evidence of their presence. In addition, EPR can identify the paramagnetic species that are detected, which present information on the molecular structure near the unpaired electron and give insight into dynamic processes such as molecular motions or fluidity. Our EPR instruments are used for a wide range of applications, including advanced materials research, materials analysis and quality control.
MRI is a process of creating an image from the manipulation of hydrogen atoms in a magnetic field. In the presence of an external magnetic field, atoms will align with or against the external magnetic field. Application of a radio frequency causes the atoms to jump between high and low energy states. MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or MRS, include many methods including diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, molecular imaging and contrast-enhance. MRI offers high resolution morphologic information, as well as functional, metabolic or molecular information. Customers use our MRI systems in pharmaceutical research, including metabolomics, to study a number of diseases, including diabetes, neurology, oncology and cardiovascular disorders.
MPI is a process of creating an image from magnetic particles administered to the body of an animal. The magnetic particles are manipulated in a combination of oscillating magnetic fields exhibiting a field free zone. The response of the particles allows a real time 3D data set acquisition of the whole body of an animal, showing the contrast agent distributing in and flowing through the body. This imaging modality is used to detect cardiovascular disorders.
PET is a process of creating an image from positrons after administration of a positron emitting radionuclide to the body of an animal. Annihilation of the positron produces two photons which show an angle of 180° between them, distinguishing these photons from photons originating from other sources. The PET tracer enriches in certain regions of interest within the body and gains molecular information from the animal in vivo. This has widespread applications, most importantly for oncology, inflammation, neurology and cardiovascular disorders, as well as metabolic disease, drug discovery and bone disease.
SPECT uses a contrast agent containing radionuclides which directly emit single photons. The contrast agent enriches in certain parts of the body of an animal and generates images of the radionuclide distribution in the body. SPECT has widespread application in animal investigations in vivo, most importantly in oncology, neurology and cardiovascular disorders.
CT is a technology based on X-rays which are used to generate a complete 3D data set. The most important applications are tissue sample analysis or non-invasive in vivo animal imaging. CT offers the highest spatial resolution of all preclinical imaging modalities and is especially useful to generate morphological information about the object or animal under investigation. CT is being used in a wide range of preclinical investigations in the fields of bone-orthopedics, cardiology, pulmonology, oncology and metabolism among others.

During 2022, we launched a number of new mass spectrometry-based solutions and additional workflows, including the timsTOF HT (High-Throughput) mass spectrometer enabling researchers to analyze proteins within high sensitivity and improved linear dynamic range important for plasma proteomics applications, and microGRID capability for the timsTOF Flex MALDI and MALDI-2 platforms allowing 5um spatial resolution for tissue imaging. In tissue, protein analysis using MALDI Imaging applications were enhanced by the launch of the MALDI Hi-Plex Immunohistochemistry (IHC) labels that can potentially allow for multiplexing hundreds of proteins in a single MALDI-TOF analysis. The photocleavable mass tag approach used in the HiPlex IHC technique are uniquely formulated for high-sensitivity MALDI mass spectrometry analysis. In 2022, the BSI CALID Segment acquired Prolab AG, a Swiss-based, microfluidics components manufacturer whose components are an integral part of the nanoElute nanoflow LC system and PepSep, a nanocolumns manufacturer to augment the proteomics workflow for the timsTOF platform. Since its launch in 2016, the timsTOF has evolved into five variants, namely the Pro2, the HT, the SCP, the Flex and Flex MALDI-2 platforms which showcases the power of trapped ion mobility for life sciences applications such as multiomics and tissue imaging. In our microbiology and molecular diagnostics markets, we introduced the MALDI Biotyper Sirius broadly into the market. In our molecular diagnostics portfolio we launched two assays in the field of respiratory disease testing, primarily covering SARS-CoV 2 testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. The Fluorotyper-SARS-CoV 2 plus kit allows for a real-time PCR detection of the SARS-CoV 2 virus. It detects two viral genes in parallel as a mechanism for high sensitivity. The additional FluoroType® SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay is a multiplex real-time PCR kit that detects four viruses of clinical significance causing respiratory disease during the winter season: SARS-CoV 2, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). During 2020, the Bruker Optics division launched LUMOS II, a fully automated stand-alone FTIR imaging microscope. LUMOS II provides ultrafast FTIR imaging capabilities based on modern focal plane array (FPA) detector technology.

PCR the innovative LiquidArray® technology optimizes asymmetrical multiplex PCR for creating excess single-stranded amplicons with detection by Lights-On/-Off probes that contain a quencher (Lights-Off) or both fluorophore and quencher (Lights-On). During melting curve analysis, Lights-On/-Off probes detach from the amplicon at specific temperatures and as fluorescence is either emitted or suppressed, specific fluorescence signatures are generated by the unique FluoroCycler®XT thermocycler for the LiquidArray® multiplex PCR technology. The LiquidArray® technology supports multiplexed assays where a large number of targets is analyzed simultaneously from single samples. For example, the LiquidArray®-powered, WHO-endorsed FluoroType®MTDBR VER 2.0 assay detects more than 500 genotypes by the combined analysis of up to 45 different mutations in mycobacteria.
 Raman spectroscopy provides information on molecular structure. The mechanism of Raman scattering is different from that of infrared absorption, in that Raman and IR spectra provide complementary information. Raman is useful for the identification of both organic and inorganic compounds and functional groups. It is a nondestructive technique and can be used for the analysis of both liquids and solids. Raman is well suited for use in the polymer and pharmaceutical industries, and has applications in the metals, electronics and semiconductors industries.

In addition, we have adopted a distribution business model in which we engage in strategic distribution alliances with other companies to address certain market segments. The sales cycle for our products is dependent on the size and complexity of the system and budgeting cycles of our customers. Our sales cycle is typically three to twenty-four months for academic and high-end research products and two weeks to six months for industrial products. The sales cycle of our low temperature superconducting materials is typically four to twelve months, with cycles of certain high-end materials exceeding one year. Sales of our high-end NMR and superconducting devices typically take more than one year and certain large, complex contracts can take more than two years to complete.

We have well-equipped applications and demonstration facilities and qualified application personnel who assist customers and provide product demonstrations in specific application areas. We maintain our primary demonstration facilities at our production facilities, as well as in other key market locations.
Seasonal Nature of Business
Historically, we have higher levels of revenue in the fourth quarter and lower levels of revenues in the first quarter of the year, which we believe is influenced by our customers’ budgeting cycles.
Major Customers
We have a broad and diversified customer base and we do not depend on any single customer. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in any of the last three fiscal years or more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.
Competition
Our existing products and solutions and any products and solutions that we develop in the future may compete in multiple, highly competitive markets. In addition, there has been a trend towards consolidation in our industries and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors may succeed in developing and offering products that could render our products or those of our strategic partners obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may also have cost and price advantages based upon the value of their currencies compared with the U.S. Dollar or Euro. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly more experience in the life sciences, chemical and materials markets. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach our target markets in a timely manner and are technologically superior to and/or less expensive, or more cost effective, than products marketed by our competitors. Current competitors or other companies may possess or develop technologies and products that are more effective than ours. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or by entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors.
We also compete with companies that provide analytical or automation tools based on technologies other than those we offer. These technologies may prove to be more successful in meeting demands in the markets that our products and solutions are intended to serve. In addition, other companies may choose to enter our fields in the future. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are technology-based applications expertise, product specifications, functionality, reliability, marketing expertise, distribution capability, proprietary patent portfolios and cost effectiveness.

Our research and development efforts are conducted for the relevant products within each of the operating segments, as well as in collaboration with others on areas such as microfluidics, automation and workflow management software. We have been the recipient of government grants from Germany and the United States for various projects related to early-stage research and development. We have generally retained, at a minimum, non-exclusive rights to any items or enhancements we develop under these grants. The German government requires that we use and market technology developed under grants in order to retain our rights to the technology. We have also accepted some sponsored research contracts from private sources.

BEST maintains technical competencies in the production and development of low and high temperature superconducting materials and devices.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property consists of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, and trademarks. Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our businesses because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and to the marketplace. We have a substantial patent portfolio, and we intend to file additional patent applications as appropriate. We believe our owned and licensed patent portfolio provides us with a competitive advantage. This portfolio permits us to maintain access to a number of key technologies. We license our owned patent rights where appropriate. We intend to enforce our patent rights against infringers, if necessary. The patent positions of life sciences tools companies involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, we cannot predict the enforceability of our patents with certainty. In addition, we are aware of the existence from time to time of patents in certain countries, which, if valid, could impair our ability to manufacture and sell products in these countries.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright protection and licensing to develop and maintain our competitive position. We generally require the execution of confidentiality agreements by our employees, consultants, and other scientific advisors. These agreements provide that all confidential information made known during the course of a relationship with us will be held in confidence and used only for our benefit. In addition, these agreements provide that we own all inventions generated during the course of the relationship. 
Government Contracts
We are a party to various government contracts. Under some of these government contracts, the government may receive license or similar rights to intellectual property developed under the contract. However, under government contracts we enter we generally receive at least non-exclusive rights to any items or technologies we develop. Although we transact business with various government agencies, we believe that no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract or subcontracts at the election of the government would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Government Regulation
We are required to comply with federal, state, and local environmental protection regulations. We do not expect this compliance to have a significant impact on our capital spending, earnings or competitive position.
Our products are subject to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s, or the FDA’s, requirements for electronic radiation emitting products, which include requirements related to record-keeping and reporting; labeling; notification; product repairs, replacements and refunds; importation; and performance standards. For example, prior to introducing a product in the United States, our Bruker AXS subsidiary provides notice to the FDA in the form of a Radiation Safety Initial Product Abbreviated Report, which provides identification information and operating characteristics of the product. If the FDA finds that the report is complete, it provides approval in the form of what is known as an accession number. Bruker AXS may not market a product until it has received an accession number. In addition, Bruker AXS submits an annual report to the FDA that includes the radiation safety history of all products it sells in the United States. Bruker AXS is required to report to the FDA incidents of accidental exposure to radiation arising from the manufacture, testing, or use of any of its products. Bruker AXS also reports installations of its products to state government regulatory agencies responsible for the regulation of radiation emitting devices. For sales in Germany, Bruker AXS registers each system with the local authorities. In some countries where Bruker AXS sells systems, Bruker AXS uses the license we obtained from the federal authorities in Germany to assist it in obtaining a license from the country in which the sale occurs.
Our Bruker AXS subsidiary possesses low-level radiation materials licenses from the local radiation safety authority, Gewerbeaufsichtsamt Karlsruhe, for its facility in Karlsruhe, Germany; and from the local radiation safety authority, Kanagawa Prefecture, for its facility in Yokohama, Japan, as well as from various other countries in which it sells its products. Our Bruker Daltonics subsidiary possesses low-level radiation licenses for facilities in Billerica, Massachusetts and Leipzig, Germany. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission also has regulations concerning the exposure of our employees to radiation.
Certain of our clinical products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States by the FDA and by similar regulatory bodies in other countries where such products are sold. The regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA and other regulatory bodies govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, and distribution. As such, we continually invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to gain and maintain certifications and registrations necessary for the relevant level of regulatory clearance. We also are required to maintain processes and systems for medical device product submissions. For example, our MALDI Biotyper CA system is subject to regulation by the FDA as a medical device and requires FDA premarket review and clearance via the 510(k) premarket notification process and our IVD-CE Certified MALDI BioTyper system is subject to regulation in the European Union under the provisions of Directive 98/79/EC. In addition, certain product changes, including changes to the product indications or label claims, could trigger the requirement for a new 510(k) or other FDA or foreign regulatory premarket submission. The process of obtaining marketing approval, authorization, or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for new products, or for enhancements or modifications to existing products, could take a significant amount of time, require the expenditure of substantial financial and other resources, and require rigorous and expensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. Additionally, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could impose limitations on the indications for use of our products. Should we pursue an FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority clearance, authorization, or approval for a new device or device modification, we cannot be certain that we will receive required clearance, authorization, or approval on a timely basis or at all. The failure to receive clearance, authorization, or approval for significant new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or at all could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Both before and after a medical device product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA and foreign regulations. For example, we are required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which sets forth the good manufacturing requirements for medical devices. These include requirements related to design controls, production and process controls, process validation, purchasing controls, supplier oversight, complaint handling and investigation, corrective and preventative actions, and record-keeping. In addition, the FDA’s medical device reporting regulation requires us to provide information to the FDA whenever we become aware that there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, that a malfunction occurred which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities also regulate the promotion and marketing of medical devices and require that manufacturers only make promotional claims or statements that are consistent with the indications and labeling cleared, authorized, or approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may take enforcement action against us, should the FDA determine we have engaged in “off-label” promotion or other violative marketing activities.
The European Union Directive 98/97/EC (IVDD) was replaced by the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of April 5, 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR). The IVDR became applicable in May 2022. The regime changes significantly with the IVDR. In comparison to the IVDD, the IVDR requires, among other things, more clinical evidence to demonstrate the claimed benefits and safety of the device in relation to its stated purpose, stricter classification and CE-marking requirements and ongoing post-market follow-up to ensure conformity. The IVDR also requires new databases to be set up to track which devices are CE marked and to register clinical studies and post-market monitoring. In addition, tracing is enhanced by a Unique Device Identification (UDI) System

and through requirements on other economic operators in the supply chain. Our products currently approved under the IVDD, and not already placed on the market or put into service, must be recertified under the IVDR.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of firm orders under non-cancelable purchase orders received from customers. Total remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $2,258.8 million and $2,077.2 million, respectively. The increase in our backlog in 2022 when compared to 2021 is due to strengthening demand in our BSI order bookings as of December 31, 2022. We generally experience variable and fluctuating revenues in the first three quarters of the year, while our fourth quarter revenues have historically been stronger than the rest of the year. As a result, backlog on any particular date can be indicative of our short-term revenue performance but is not necessarily a reliable indicator of long-term revenue performance.
Human Capital
We are committed to enabling scientists to make breakthrough discoveries and develop new applications that improve the quality of human life. Our employees are a critical component of that mission. We endeavor to attract, develop and retain top talent by offering our employees a challenging but rewarding work experience, as well as competitive compensation and benefits. Further, we strive to create a work environment that promotes integrity, respect and trust among our employees.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately 8,525 and 7,765 full-time employees worldwide, respectively. Of these employees, approximately 1,410 and 1,230 were located in the United States at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our senior leadership team is 79% male and 21% female.

 Diversity, Talent Retention and Development
Bruker has initiatives and programs to attract, develop and retain our talent tailored to specific employee populations and geographies, including leadership development programs, technical training, and other skill-based training.
Several leadership development programs are in place for global groups and functions where competency-based performance assessments are completed annually to identify employees who qualify as high performers and high potentials for advancement into key leadership positions. These individuals are provided with additional skill, mentoring, and project opportunities to strengthen their capabilities for career advancement as future successors across the organization.
 Bruker has created a tailor-made development program for talent providing them with an opportunity to develop their leadership skills over a period of 12 months by attending different modules, which are run in a hybrid format. Each participant is supported by a mentor during the program. The program builds on the cornerstones of the cultural journey program that was run in 2021 and 2022. The focus on our company culture continues through a network of Cultural Champions organized in working groups with a focus on creating an inclusive workplace, development, and communication.
In 2022, we initiated a pilot program for the use of a leading online learning platform for global deployment. This pilot program was successful and we have further expanded the platform in 2023. Among the platform developments, we created specific training paths to support technical skill development of users. These paths off skills and development opportunities. Learning modules were also integrated into quarterly training sessions to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing among users.
 We have an established global performance management process in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees. Throughout the year, managers and employees engage in annual objective setting, mid-year reviews of performance as well as a year-end performance evaluation. We also have employee populations piloting the use of our Talent Management System to capture career development goals as well as learning paths, certifications achieved, languages spoken and mobility preferences to promote internal career opportunities.
Challenges to recruit in the highly competitive external market have increased our focus on employer branding initiatives to further improve our visibility and attractiveness for potential candidates.

Bruker is focused on promoting diversity across our organization. Our employees come from diverse backgrounds all over the world. We are united by a shared purpose—innovation with integrity. We hope that the work we do every day inspires and impacts global scientific research—and our diverse and dynamic team of people inspire each other to achieve their full potential. We build cross-functional teams to support collaboration and enable the creation of new ideas by actively identifying and recruiting talent with diverse professional experiences, skills and backgrounds including from diverse gender, racial and ethnic backgrounds.
One of these programs aimed to bring employees together across the organization to focus on diversity is Women@Bruker. This program was developed to offer mentorship opportunities and foster professional relationships for women at Bruker to support their development and advancement opportunities.
 In the context of celebrating diversity, we actively participate in Girls' Day. Girls' Day is a nationwide orientation day in Germany for girls ages 10 and older, to support their career and educational orientation. The aim of the initiative is to establish a career and education choice free of gender stereotypes. On this day, participants throughout Germany learn about professions or fields of study in which the representation of women is less than 40 percent (e.g. representation in the natural sciences and technology). Often the participants have a chance to meet female role models in leadership positions in business and politics. In one of our segments, each year we host a group of young girls who meet our female employees who talk about their personal career path and journey to inspire the younger generation to pursue their career dreams.
 Employee Health and Safety
Ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees is a top priority for Bruker. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional health and safety protocols at our sites including enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing requirements. We implemented a remote work policy for all employees whose job allowed them to do so. Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) was provided to employees, and work procedures were modified to reduce risk. Also, we engaged with a vendor to offer at home COVID-19 testing kits for those employees who needed to travel to customer sites as well as implemented an enhanced Employee Assistance Program to promote mental and physical wellness. We continue to refine these measures as the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic evolve and information about the virus develops.
In the United States, our Wellness Program is established and continues to be enhanced. In 2022, we introduced our Wellness Program to Bruker employees and the program has grown significantly in response to employee interest and impact. The program currently includes regular communication to promote Bruker Health and Wellbeing initiatives, wellness challenges and specialized webinars to provide education designed to improve Bruker employee physical, emotional, social, and financial health.
 Our sites around the globe are mindful that the safety and well-being of our employees is a top priority. One site recognized an increase in muscle pain with production teams and a successful activity was incorporated into each production shift encouraging employees to stretch and do light exercise to prepare them for their work thus reducing the likelihood of strain.
 A program called “Caught Doing the Right Thing” is a Safety and Quality recognition program for hourly employees. The focus of the program is to recognize employees who demonstrate the correct behaviors on safety and quality. This has encouraged active engagement from employees to take the safety and quality of themselves and their teams as a personal initiative.
