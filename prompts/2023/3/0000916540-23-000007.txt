ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Founded by the Swift meat packing interests and the Darling family in 1882, Darling Ingredients Inc. (“Darling”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 under the name “Darling-Delaware Company, Inc.”  Darling changed its name from “Darling-Delaware Company, Inc.” to “Darling International Inc.” on December 28, 1993, and from “Darling International Inc.” to “Darling Ingredients Inc.” on May 6, 2014. The address of Darling's principal executive office is 5601 N MacArthur Boulevard, Irving, Texas, 75038, and its telephone number at this address is (972) 717-0300.
OVERVIEW
We are a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, animal feed, industrial, fuel, bioenergy and fertilizer industries. In fiscal 2022, the Company completed several acquisitions including two material rendering operations, Valley Proteins in North America and the FASA Group in South America. See Note 3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. With operations on five continents, the Company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into useable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The Company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the Company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. In fiscal year 2022, the Company generated $6.5 billion in revenues and $737.7 million in net income attributable to Darling.
North America
We are a leading provider of animal by-product processing, used cooking oil and bakery residual recycling and recovery solutions to the U.S. food industry. We operate over 155 processing and transfer facilities in the United States to produce finished products such as protein (primarily meat and bone meal (“MBM”) and poultry meal (“PM”)), meat products for the pet food industry, blood products (plasma and whole blood), collagen, fats (primarily bleachable fancy tallow (“BFT”), poultry grease (“PG”) and yellow grease (“YG”)), bakery by-products (“BBP”) and hides, as well as a range of branded and value-added products.

OPERATIONS
Feed Ingredients Segment
Our Feed Ingredients segment consists principally of (i) our U.S. ingredients and speciality products businesses, including our fats and proteins, used cooking oil, and trap grease collection business, our Canadian ingredients business, and the ingredients and specialty products businesses conducted by Darling Ingredients International under the Sonac and FASA names (proteins, fats and plasma products) and (ii) our bakery residuals business. 

Animal By-Products
 North American Operations
Raw materials: The Company's North American animal by-products operations collect beef, poultry and pork by-products, which are collected primarily from slaughterhouses, grocery stores, butcher shops and food service establishments. These raw materials are collected in one of two manners.  Certain large suppliers, such as large slaughterhouses, are furnished with bulk containers in which the raw material is loaded.  We provide the remaining suppliers, primarily grocery stores and butcher shops, with containers in which to deposit the raw material.  The containers are picked up by, or emptied into, the Company’s trucks on a periodic basis.  The type and frequency of service is determined by individual supplier requirements, the volume of raw material generated by the supplier, supplier location and weather, among other factors. The raw materials we collect are transported either directly to a processing plant or to a transfer station where materials from several collection routes are loaded into trailers and transported to a processing plant.  These raw materials are delivered to plants for processing usually within 24 hours of collection to deter spoilage.
Processing operations: We produce finished products primarily through the grinding, cooking, separating, drying, and blending of various raw materials.  The process starts with the collection of animal by-products, including fat, bones, feathers, offal and other animal by-products.  The animal by-products are ground and heated to evaporate water and separate fats from animal tissue, as well as to sterilize and make the material suitable as an ingredient for animal feed.  The separated fats, tallows and greases are then centrifuged and/or refined for purity.  The remaining solid product is pressed to remove additional oils to create protein meals.  The protein meal is then sifted through screens and ground further if necessary to produce an appropriately sized protein meal. The primary finished products derived from the processing of animal by-products are MBM, PM (both feed grade and pet food), PG, tallow, feather meal and blood meal.  In addition, at certain of our facilities, we are able to operate multiple process lines simultaneously, which provides us with the flexibility and capacity to manufacture a line of premium and value-added products in addition to our principal finished products.  Because of these processing controls, we are able to produce premium products that typically have higher protein and energy content and lower moisture than standard finished products, and such products command premium prices.
  International Operations
Darling Ingredients International’s ingredients and specialty products businesses are operated under the Sonac and FASA names by our Sonac C3 and Sonac Blood business activities. The Sonac ingredients and specialty products businesses of Darling Ingredients International operate similarly to our North American ingredients division. However, the Sonac businesses, with the exception of Sonac C3, further separate raw material streams to add additional value to each stream. 
Sonac C3 processes animal by-products collected primarily from slaughterhouses, into proteins and fats for applications used in the pet food, feed, technical, biofuels and oleo-chemical markets. Oleo-chemical producers use fats to produce specialty ingredients used in paint, rubber, paper, concrete, plastics and a variety of other consumer and industrial products.
Sonac Blood processes bovine, porcine and ovine blood by separating blood into plasma and hemoglobin and produces specialized end products for application in the feed and pet food markets. Sonac Blood’s end products include plasma, fibrimex, globin and hemin. 
 Used Cooking Oil
The Company is a leading collector and processor of used cooking oil in North America for use as a valuable low carbon fuel and feed ingredient. The Company estimates it collects used cooking oil from approximately 191,000 locations in the U.S. The Company’s primary customer for this product is the DGD Joint Venture.
Page 6


Raw materials: Used cooking oil is collected from restaurants, food service establishments and grocery stores. Many of our suppliers operate stores that are part of national chains. Used cooking oil is placed in various sizes and types of containers and supplied to the Company under mutually agreeable contract terms. In some instances, these containers are unloaded directly onto our trucks, while in other instances used cooking oil is pumped through a vacuum hose into the truck.  We provide several types of containers for used cooking oil collection to food service establishments, which are proprietary self-contained collection systems that are housed either inside or outside the establishment, with the used cooking oil pumped directly into collection vehicles via an outside valve. The frequency of all forms of used cooking oil collection is determined by the volume of oil generated by the restaurant, food service establishment or grocery store.
Processing operations: The used cooking oil we collect is heated, settled, and purified for use as a feedstock for biofuels or as an ingredient for animal feed.
 Bakery Residuals
The Company is a leading processor of bakery residuals in the United States.  The bakery residuals division, which operates solely in the United States, collects bakery residual materials and processes the raw materials into BBP, including Cookie Meal®, an animal feed ingredient primarily used in poultry and swine rations.
Raw materials: Bakery residuals are collected from large commercial bakeries that produce a variety of products, including cookies, crackers, cereal, bread, dough, potato chips, pretzels, sweet goods and biscuits.  The Company collects these materials by bulk loading onsite at the bakeries utilizing proprietary equipment, the majority of which is designed, engineered, manufactured and installed by us.  All of the bakery residuals that the Company collects is bulk loaded, which we believe represents a significant advantage over competitors that receive a large percentage of raw materials from less efficient, manual methods.  The receipt of bulk-loaded bakery residuals allows us to significantly streamline our bakery recycling process, reduce personnel costs, and maximize freight savings by hauling more tons per load.
Processing operations: The highly automated bakery residuals production process involves sorting and separating raw material, mixing it to produce the appropriate nutritional content, drying it to reduce excess moisture, and grinding it to the consistency of animal feed.  During the bakery residuals process, packaging materials are removed.  The packaging material is fed into a combustion chamber along with sawdust, and heat is produced.  This heat is used in the dryers to remove moisture from the raw materials that have been partially ground.  Finally, the dried meal is ground to the specified granularity.  The finished product, which is continually tested to ensure that the caloric and nutrient contents meet specifications, is a nutritious additive used in animal feed.

 Other Products/Services
Our Feed Ingredients segment also includes the Company’s organic fertilizer business conducted under the Nature Safe® name, insect protein business conducted under the EnviroFlight® name, hides businesses and grease trap services business. 
•Our fertilizer operations utilize finished products from our animal by-products division to manufacture organic fertilizers from ingredients approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to be used in organic farming which contain no waste by-products (i.e., sludge or sewage waste). The Company's North American fertilizer products are predominantly sold to golf courses, sports facilities, organic farms and landscaping companies.
•Our EnviroFlight business utilizes technologies which enable the rearing of non-pathogenic black soldier fly larvae, which larvae are then processed to produce specialty protein for use as an ingredient in animal feed and pet food.
•Our hides operations process hides and skins from beef and hog processors, respectively, into outputs used in commercial applications, such as the leather industry. We sell treated hides and skins to external customers, the majority of which are tanneries. Fresh and salted hides and fresh skins are sold to tanneries, automotive companies, leather processors and to the shoe and furniture industries in Italy, Germany and China.
•Our grease trap services business provides our customers with a comprehensive set of solutions to their trap grease disposal needs, including manifests for regulatory compliance, computerized routing for consistent cleaning and comprehensive trap cleaning. The trap grease we collect is transported to waste treatment centers.

Food Ingredients Segment
Our Food Ingredients segment consists principally of (i) the collagen business conducted by Darling Ingredients International under the Rousselot name, (ii) the natural casings and meat by-products business conducted by Darling Ingredients International under the CTH name and (iii) certain specialty products businesses conducted by Darling Ingredients International under the Sonac name. 
 Collagen

Rousselot is a global leading market provider of collagen for the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and technical (e.g., photographic) industries with operations in Europe, China, South America and the United States. Rousselot has a network of 11 production plants and six sales locations, covering sales into more than 70 countries. With the Rousselot collagen business, the Company is part of the growing global collagen market. Collagen is a functional ingredient, which means that it has a role in the end product by adding a critical property to it that is largely non-substitutable. Collagen is used in a large variety of end products, but only small amounts are used in most products. Currently, available substitutes are limited and do not have the broad functionality required for most usages. Rousselot collagen products have higher sales prices relative to the Company’s other end products, but comprise a minimal portion of the cost of final products in many segments, for example the pharmaceutical end markets. We believe many end customers focus on collagen quality and consistency, supply reliability, application know-how and regulatory support and are therefore relatively less price sensitive to collagen products. Rousselot’s profitability is mainly driven by its ability to timely transfer increases in net raw material costs to its customers in order to realize a relatively stable added value per kilogram of collagen, in combination with a strong focus on operations excellence and product quality. Rousselot is involved in all four types of collagen (pigskin, hide, bone and fish). Raw material prices are mainly driven by the availability and quality of raw material, and sales prices are mainly driven by market demand and the expected availability of collagen supply. As such, securing sufficient raw material positions is key to the business. Rousselot enters into formal arrangements related to raw material purchases that differ by raw material type, by duration and by regional area. Rousselot markets its hydrolyzed collagen under the “Peptan” brand; this fast-growing specialty ingredient is positioned specifically towards nutritional supplement customers focusing on improved bone, joint and skin health.
 Other Specialty Products 
In addition, our Food Ingredients segment includes the Sonac bone, heparin and edible fat businesses currently operated by Darling Ingredients International under the Sonac name: 
•Sonac Fat primarily melts, refines and packages animal fat into food grade fat for the food markets.
•Sonac Bone processes porcine bones into fat, bone protein, glue, bone ash and bone chips for the feed, pet food, food and collagen industries.
•Sonac Heparin extracts crude heparin from hydrolyzed mucosa for application in the pharmaceutical industry.

 Natural Casings and Meat By-Products

The CTH business of Darling Ingredients International is a leading natural casings company for the sausage business with operations in Europe, China and the United States. The activities of this business are divided into two categories: 
•CTH Casings harvests, sorts and sells hog and sheep casings for worldwide food markets, particularly sausage manufacturers, and harvests, processes and sells hog and beef bowel package items for global pharmaceutical, food and feed market segments. CTH holds a leading position in the highly fragmented global casings market. 
•CTH Meat By-Products harvests, purchases and processes hog, sheep and beef meat for customers in the global food and European pet food industries. In the meat by-products market, CTH is a major player with established sales networks in Europe and Asia. 
Fuel Ingredients Segment
Our Fuel Ingredients segment consists of (i) our investment in the DGD Joint Venture and (ii) the bioenergy business conducted by Darling Ingredients International under the Ecoson and Rendac names.

 Diamond Green Diesel
The DGD Joint Venture currently operates two renewable diesel plants, one located adjacent to Valero’s St. Charles Refinery in Norco, Louisiana (the “DGD St. Charles Plant”) and one located adjacent to Valero’s Port Arthur Refinery in Port Arthur, Texas (the “DGD Port Arthur Plant” and, together with the DGD St. Charles Plant, the “DGD Facilities”), with a combined renewable diesel production capacity of approximately 1.2 billion gallons per year. Renewable diesel is a low-carbon transportation fuel that is interchangeable with diesel produced from petroleum and is produced at the DGD Facilities using an advanced hydroprocessing-isomerization process licensed from UOP LLC, known as the Ecofining™ Process, and a pretreatment process developed by the Desmet Ballestra Group to convert fats (animal fats, used cooking oils, distillers corn oil and vegetable oils) into renewable diesel, renewable naphtha and other light end renewable hydrocarbons. The DGD Joint Venture was formed in January 2011 to design, engineer, construct and operate the DGD St. Charles Plant, which reached mechanical completion and began production of renewable diesel and certain other co-products in late June 2013. In October 2021, the DGD Joint Venture completed an expansion of the DGD St. Charles Plant that increased its renewable diesel production capability to up to 750 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, as well as separating renewable naphtha (approximately 30 million gallons) and other light end renewable hydrocarbons for sale into low carbon fuel markets, at a total cost, including naphtha production and improved logistics capability, of approximately $1.1 billion. Additionally, in November 2022 the DGD Joint Venture completed the construction of the DGD Port Arthur Plant, with a name plate capacity to produce 470 million gallons per year of renewable diesel and 20 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha and having similar logistics flexibilities as those of the DGD St. Charles Plant. The DGD Port Arthur Plant was completed at a total cost of approximately $1.43 billion. Furthermore, in January 2023, the DGD Joint Venture partners approved a capital project at the DGD Port Arthur Plant to provide the plant with the capability to upgrade approximately fifty percent (50%) of its current 470 million gallon annual production capacity to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Work on the project is underway, with completion expected in 2025 at a total estimated cost of approximately $315 million. 
The DGD Facilities receive feedstocks primarily by rail and trucks owned by third-parties as well as imports via ships. We are a party to a raw material supply agreement with the DGD Joint Venture pursuant to which we are obligated to offer to supply the DGD Joint Venture a portion of the feedstock requirements at the DGD St. Charles Plant at market rates; however, the DGD Joint Venture is not obligated to purchase all or any part of its feedstock requirements from us. The DGD Joint Venture’s renewable diesel is sold under the Diamond Green Diesel® brand primarily to obligated parties who produce or import petroleum-based fuels into areas subject to renewable fuels obligations. The DGD Joint Venture sells renewable diesel domestically and exports renewable diesel into global markets, primarily Canada and Europe. Renewable diesel is distributed primarily by rail and ships owned by third-parties.
We account for the DGD Joint Venture as an “investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary.”
 Bioenergy
In Europe, Ecoson produces green power from biogas production out of organic sludge and food waste for combined heat plant installations. Ecoson is the largest industrial digestion operation in the Netherlands and Belgium. In addition, Ecoson's fat refinery produces refined fats and fatty acids. Ecoson also processes manure into natural biophosphate for use as fertilizer and green gas.
Rendac collects fallen stock and animal waste, also referred to as Category 1 and Category 2 material under EU Regulation 1069/2009, from farmers and slaughterhouses, and processes these materials into fats and meals, which can only be used as a low grade source of energy or fuel for boilers and cement kilns. With a specialized collection fleet of approximately 350 trucks, Rendac collects raw materials in the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium. This business is a market leader in the countries of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (the "Benelux region") and certain parts of Germany, a predominantly regulated market with spare capacity requirements and long-term contracts with local governments. The market for the collection and processing of fallen stock in these regions is regulated, and government contracts provide for exclusivity of the service to the contracted partner. 
Raw materials pricing and supply contracts
We have two primary pricing arrangements (formula and non-formula) with our suppliers of poultry, beef, pork, bakery residuals and used cooking oil.  Under a “formula” arrangement, the charge or credit for raw materials is tied to published finished product prices for a competing ingredient after deducting a fixed processing fee. We also acquire raw material under “non-formula” arrangements whereby suppliers are either paid a fixed price, are not paid, or are charged a collection fee, depending on various economic and competitive factors.  The credit received or amount charged for raw 
Page 9


materials under both formula and non-formula arrangements is based on various factors, including the type of raw materials, demand for the raw materials, the expected value of the finished product to be produced, the anticipated yields, the volume of material generated by the supplier and processing and transportation costs. Formula prices are generally adjusted on a weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, while non-formula prices or charges are adjusted as needed to respond to changes in finished product prices or related operating costs. Since most of our raw materials are residual by-products of meat processing and other food production, we are not able to contract with our suppliers to increase supply if demand for our products increases.
A majority of our U.S. volume of rendering raw materials, including all of our significant poultry accounts, and substantially all of our bakery feed raw materials are acquired on a “formula basis,” which in most cases is set forth in contracts with our suppliers, generally with multi-year terms. These “formulas” allow us to manage the risk associated with decreases in commodity prices by adjusting our costs of materials based on changes in the price of our finished products, while also permitting us, in certain cases, to benefit from increases in commodity prices. The formulas provided in these contracts are reviewed and modified both during the term of, and in connection with the renewal of, the contracts to maintain an acceptable level of sharing between us and our suppliers of the costs and benefits from movements in commodity prices. Approximately 89% of Darling's U.S. volume of raw materials in fiscal year 2022 was acquired on a "formula" basis. A majority of Darling's Canadian ingredients volume of rendering raw materials are acquired based on prices fixed on a monthly basis with suppliers, with the remaining portion acquired on a “formula basis.” Darling Ingredients International (including North American operations) acquires a majority of its volume of rendering raw materials at spot or quarterly fixed prices and, in general, has no long term contracts with its key suppliers.
Certain of the Company's geographic regions' facilities are highly dependent on one or a few suppliers.  During the 2022 fiscal year, the Company's 10 largest raw materials suppliers in North America accounted for approximately 33% of the total raw material processed by the Company in North America, with one single supplier accounting for approximately 8% of the total raw material processed in North America. In Europe, the Company's 10 largest raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 30% of the total raw material processed by the Company in Europe, with one single supplier accounting for approximately 11% of the total raw material processed in Europe. In China, the Company's 10 largest raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 34% of the total raw material processed by the Company in China, with one single supplier accounting for approximately 9% of the total raw material processed in China. In South America, the Company's 10 largest raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 52% of the total raw material processed by the Company in South America, with one single supplier accounting for approximately 23% of the total raw material processed in South America. See “Risk Factors - A significant percentage of our revenue is attributable to a limited number of suppliers and customers.”  Should any of these suppliers choose alternate methods of disposal, cease or materially decrease their operations, have their operations interrupted by casualty, or otherwise cease using, or reduce the use of, the Company’s collection services, any operating facilities dependent on such suppliers could be materially and adversely affected.  (See “Risk Factors-Certain of our operating facilities are highly dependent upon a single or a few suppliers.”) For a discussion of the Company’s competition for raw materials, see “Competition.”
MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION OF FINISHED PRODUCTS
The Company sells its finished products worldwide.  Finished product sales are primarily managed through our commodity trading departments. With respect to our North American operations, we have trading departments located at our corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas, at our regional office in Cold Spring, Kentucky and our regional office in Winchester, Virginia.  Darling Ingredients International’s finished product sales are managed primarily through trading departments that are located in Son en Breugel, the Netherlands, and through various offices located in Europe, Asia, South America and North America. Where appropriate, we coordinate international sales of common products in order to market them more efficiently. Our sales force is in contact with customers daily and coordinates the sale, and assists in the distribution of, most finished products produced at our processing plants.  The Company also sells its finished products internationally directly to customers or, in some cases, through commodities brokers and agents. We market certain of our finished products under our Dar Pro Ingredients brand, certain specialty products under the Sonac and FASA names, collagen products under the Rousselot name and natural casings and meat by-products under the CTH name. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for a breakdown of the Company’s sales by geographic regions.
The Company sells finished products in North America and throughout the world, primarily to producers of animal feed, pet food, biofuel, fertilizer and other consumer and industrial products, including oleo-chemicals, soaps and leather goods, for use as ingredients in their products or for further processing.  Certain of our finished products are ingredients that compete with alternatives, such as corn, soybean oil, inedible corn oil, palm oils, soybean meal and heating oil, based on nutritional and functional values; therefore, the actual pricing for those finished products, as well as competing products, can be quite volatile. While the Company's principal finished products are generally sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale, the Company's ability to deliver large quantities of finished products from multiple locations and to coordinate sales from a central 
Page 10


location enables us to sell into the market with the highest return. The Company's premium, value-added and branded products command significantly higher pricing relative to the Company's principal finished product lines due to their enhanced nutritional content, which is a function of the Company's specialized processing techniques. Customers for our premium, value-added and branded products include feed mills, pet food manufacturers, integrated poultry producers, the dairy industry and golf courses. Feed mills purchase meals, fats, blood products, and Cookie Meal® for use as feed ingredients. Pet food manufacturers require stringent feed safety certifications and consistently demand premium additives that are high in protein and nutritional content. As a result, pet food manufacturers typically purchase only premium or value-added products under supply contracts with us. Oleo-chemical producers use fats as feedstocks to produce specialty ingredients used in paint, rubber, paper, concrete, plastics and a variety of other consumer and industrial products. Darling Ingredients International’s premium, value-added and branded products also command higher pricing, including with respect to collagen, natural casings, meat by-products, edible fat, heparin and specialty plasma products.
We obtain payment protection for most of our global export sales by requiring payment before shipment, either through bank letters of credit or cash against documents at the origin of the sale or guarantees of payment from government agencies. For U.S. sales, we are ordinarily paid for products in U.S. dollars and have not experienced any material currency translation losses or any material foreign exchange control difficulties. Darling Ingredients International’s product sales are generally denominated in the local currency. However, in certain markets (such as South America), some product sales are denominated in non-functional currencies, such as U.S. dollars and euros. Darling Ingredients International hedges a portion of its non-functional currency product sales.

Our management monitors market conditions and prices for our finished products on a daily basis.  If market conditions or prices were to significantly change, our management would evaluate and implement any measures that it may deem necessary to respond to the change in market conditions.  For larger formula-based pricing suppliers, the indexing of raw material cost to finished product prices effectively establishes the gross margin on finished product sales at a stable level, providing us some protection from finished product price declines.
Finished products produced by the Company are shipped primarily by truck or rail from our plants shortly following production. While there can be some temporary inventory accumulations at various North American and international locations, particularly port locations for export shipments, with the exception of collagen and natural casings, inventories rarely exceed three weeks’ production and, therefore, we use limited working capital to carry those inventories. Our limited inventories also reduce our exposure to fluctuations in finished-product prices. With respect to collagen and natural casings, Darling Ingredients International, in contrast, has historically carried much larger inventories due to the manufacturing process and market dynamics related to those products, which requires a greater amount of working capital to carry these investments. Other factors that influence competition, markets and the prices that we receive for our finished products include the quality of our finished products, consumer health consciousness, worldwide credit conditions, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and government aid and regulations.  From time to time, we enter into arrangements with our suppliers of raw materials pursuant to which these suppliers have the option to buy back our finished products at market prices.
The Company operates a fleet of trucks, trailers and railcars to transport raw materials from suppliers and finished products to customers or ports for transportation by ship.  It also utilizes third party freight companies to cost-effectively transfer materials and augment our in-house logistics fleet.  Within our bakery and international by-products divisions, except for Rendac, substantially all inbound and outbound freight is handled by third party logistics companies.
COMPETITION
We believe we are the only global ingredients company with products generated principally from animal-origin raw material types; however, we compete with a number of regional and local players in our various sub-segments and end markets.
The procurement of raw materials generally presents greater challenges to our business than the sale of finished products. In North America, consolidation within the meat processing industry has resulted in bigger and more efficient slaughtering operations, the majority of which utilize “captive” renderers (rendering operations integrated with the meat or poultry packing operation).  At the same time, there has been limited to no growth in the number of small meat processors, which have historically been a dependable source of supply for non-captive renderers, such as us.  In addition, the slaughter rates in the meat processing industry are subject to economic conditions and, as a result, during periods of economic decline, the availability, quantity and quality of raw materials available to the independent renderers decreases.  These factors have been offset, in part, however, by increasing environmental consciousness.  The need for food service establishments in the United States to comply with environmental regulations concerning the proper disposal of used restaurant cooking oil should continue to provide a growth area for this raw material source.  The rendering industry is highly fragmented with a number of local slaughtering operations that provide us with raw materials. In North America, we compete with other rendering, restaurant 
Page 11


services and bakery residual businesses, and alternative methods of disposal of animal processing by-products and used restaurant cooking oil provided by trash haulers, waste management companies, biodiesel companies, anaerobic digestion companies and others. In addition, U.S. food service establishments have increasingly experienced theft of used cooking oil.  A number of our competitors for the procurement of raw material are experienced, well-capitalized companies that have significant operating experience and historic supplier relationships.  Competition for available raw materials is based primarily on price and proximity to the supplier.
In marketing our finished products domestically and internationally, we face competition from other processors and from producers of other suitable ingredient alternatives.  However, we differentiate ourselves through the scope and depth of our product portfolio and geographic footprint. While we compete with a number of well capitalized companies across our business, such as Cargill, Inc., Tyson Foods, Inc. and JBS & Company in the U.S. products business, and others in the global collagen, bone products, and blood products business, we do not have a single competitor that we compete with across all of our products or geographies.
SEASONALITY AND SEVERE WEATHER
Although the amount of raw materials made available to us in each of our segments by our suppliers is relatively stable on a weekly basis, it is impacted by seasonal factors, including holidays, during which the availability of raw materials declines because major meat and poultry processors are not operating, and cold and other severe weather and natural disasters, which can hinder the collection of raw materials and may increase with the physical impacts of climate change.  Warm weather can also adversely affect the quality of raw materials processed and our yields on production because raw material deteriorates more rapidly in warm weather than in cooler weather.  Weather can vary significantly from one year to the next and may impact the comparability of our operating results between periods. The amount of bakery residuals we process generally increases during the summer from June to September.  Collagen sales generally decline in the summer.
CLIMATE CHANGE
There is a growing global concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency of extreme weather and natural disasters. We are subject to physical, operational, transitional and financial risks associated with climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions, as well as by legal, regulatory and market responses to climate change. We assess climate-related regulatory risks as part of our risk management process; however due to the level of uncertainty regarding what legislative or regulatory requirements may be enacted, we are unable to estimate the impact of climate-related developments on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information on the risks we face related to climate change, including potential regulatory developments that may increase our operating costs, please see the risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors, under the captions “Seasonal factors and weather, including the physical impacts of climate changes, can impact the availability, quality and volume of raw materials that we process and negatively affect our operations;” “Our operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety, and we could incur significant costs to comply with these requirements or be subject to sanctions or held liable for environmental damages;” and “We may not be able to achieve reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions and other sustainability goals.”
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Company maintains valuable trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property, and considers our intellectual property to be of material value.  We have registered or applied for registration of certain of our intellectual property, including the tricolor triangle used in our signage and logos and the names “Darling,” “Darling Ingredients”, “Griffin Industries,” “Dar Pro Solutions,” “Dar Pro,” “Rousselot,” “Sonac,” “FASA,” “Ecoson,” “Rendac,” “Rothsay,” “Nature Safe,” “CleanStar,” “Peptan,” “Cookie Meal,” and “Bakery Feeds,” and certain patents, both domestically and internationally, relating to the process for preparing nutritional supplements and the drying and processing of raw materials.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We are committed to having an engaged, diverse and inclusive workplace that fosters learning, development and innovation, and we are committed to building a culture and working environment that is inclusive and respectful for all, and where our employees can do their best work and feel valued for their contributions. We are keenly aware that our people are fundamental to the ongoing success of our business. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. In this regard, we have a strong health and safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self-audits, to ensure that our employees remain injury free. In addition, we continue to 
Page 12


monitor COVID-19 and will continue, as appropriate, to implement operational guidelines in our organization consistent with the applicable governmental and regulatory policies in the geographies we operate intended to protect our employees and prevent the spread of the virus.
We retain talent by providing employees with training, mentoring and career development. To facilitate growth and development, we’ve put several initiatives in place, including leadership training programs such as Darling Leadership Academy, Darling University and Darling Involve International Leadership Training.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed globally approximately 14,600 persons full-time. While we have no national or multi-plant union contracts, at December 31, 2022, approximately 16% of the Company's North American employees were covered by multiple collective bargaining agreements. In addition, approximately 30% of Darling Ingredients International's employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements.  Management believes that our relations with our employees and their representatives are satisfactory.  There can be no assurance, however, that these satisfactory arrangements will continue, or that new agreements will be reached without union action or on terms satisfactory to us.
REGULATIONS
We are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the following principal governmental agencies in the following countries:
United States
•The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which regulates pharmaceutical products and food and feed safety. The FDA is responsible for enforcement of rules (21 C.F.R. 589.2000 and 589.2001, referred to herein as the “BSE Feed Rule”) to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”), which is commonly referred to as “mad cow” disease. These regulations prohibit the use of mammalian proteins, with some exceptions, and tallow having more than 0.15% impurities in feeds for cattle, sheep and other ruminant animals. In addition, the BSE Feed Rule prohibits the use of brain and spinal cord material from cattle aged 30 months and older or the carcasses of such cattle, if the carcasses are not inspected and passed for human consumption and the brain and spinal cord are not removed, in the feed or food for all animals.  The FDA has also implemented restrictions on the use of specified risk materials (“SRM”), material from nonambulatory disabled cattle, and other specified cattle materials in human food (21 C.F.R. 189.5) and in cosmetics (21 C.F.R. 700.27). In addition, the FDA is responsible for implementing and enforcing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), which gives FDA a series of powers intended to better protect human and animal health by adopting a modern, preventive and risk-based approach to food safety regulation. In addition, to various authorities granted to the FDA by FSMA, the FDA has also finalized major rules under FSMA affecting the production, importation and transport of human and animal food. These authorities and regulations include:
▪Mandatory recall authority for adulterated or misbranded foods where the use of or exposure to such foods is likely to cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, if the responsible party fails to cease distribution and recall such adulterated or misbranded foods voluntarily. 
▪Regulations that define the FDA’s administrative detention authority to include the authority to detain an article of food if there is reason to believe the food is adulterated or misbranded.
▪Section 306 of the FSMA provides that the FDA must refuse admission of food into the United States if a foreign food establishment or foreign government refuses to permit entry for an inspection.

▪Section 102 of the FSMA amended facility registration requirements in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act for domestic and foreign manufacturers, processors, packers or holders of food for human or animal consumption, to require that facility registrations be renewed during the fourth quarter of each even-numbered year, beginning October 1, 2012, and that additional information be included in such registrations. FSMA also provides that, if the FDA determines that food manufactured, processed, packed, received, or held by a registered facility has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, the FDA may suspend the registration of a facility that created, caused, or was otherwise responsible for such reasonable probability, or knew or had reason to know of such probability and packed, received, or held the food.
Page 13


▪The FDA has issued final rules for preventive controls (“PCs”) for human food and animal feed (“Human Food PC Rule” and “Animal Food PC Rule,” respectively), which apply to registered FDA facilities that manufacture, process, pack and hold human or animal food and require these facilities to establish and implement written food safety plans, which include hazard analyses, PCs to ensure that significant hazards that are identified as needing to be controlled will be significantly reduced or prevented, monitoring of PCs, supply-chain controls if appropriate to control a significant hazard, recall plans, corrective action procedures, verification activities and record keeping standards. The Human Food PC Rule also updates existing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMPs”), and the Animal Food PC Rule establishes minimum CGMPs for the production, holding and distribution of the human or animal food.

▪The FDA has issued a regulation relating to Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (“FSVP Rule”) requiring that importers of both human and animal food must develop, follow and maintain written procedures verifying that their foreign suppliers produce food in a manner that provides the same level of public health protection as the Human Food PC Rule, Animal Food PC Rule, or FDA’s regulations established under FSMA regarding produce safety, as appropriate, and must ensure that the suppliers’ food is not adulterated and is not misbranded with respect to allergen labeling of human food. 
▪Under FSMA, the Sanitary Transportation Food Act of 2005, and FDA’s regulation, sanitary transportation practices must be used to transport human and animal foods to prevent such food from being adulterated during transport and applies to shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle or rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food.
▪The FDA has finalized a rule that requires registered human food facilities to conduct a vulnerability assessment and implement mitigation strategies, including a written food defense plan, to prevent or mitigate potential acts of intentional adulteration of food that could harm the public health.
▪The FDA issued a final rule establishing the Laboratory Accreditation for Analyses of Foods (“LAAF”) program as required by FSMA section 202(a). Under the LAAF program, FDA will recognize accreditation bodies that will accredit laboratories to the standards established in this final rule. Laboratories accredited to the LAAF standard (“LAAF-accredited laboratories”) are authorized to conduct certain food testing as described in the rule. In September 2022, FDA launched a LAAF Dashboard which maintains a list of FDA-recognized Accreditation Bodies for the LAAF Program.
▪The FDA has issued a final rule establishing additional traceability recordkeeping requirements for persons that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods that appear on a list of “high risk” foods. The list of high risk foods includes certain fruits and vegetables, shell eggs, and certain types of seafood, among other products. Entities that are subject to the rule will be required to establish and maintain traceability program records containing required information. The compliance date for all persons subject to the rule is January 20, 2026.
Management believes we are in compliance with these provisions of FSMA and the finalized rules. 
The FDA also has regulations governing food additives in animal feed and pet food, which could apply to the use of protein from black soldier fly larvae in such products. The FDA acknowledges that it considers the listing of animal feed and pet food ingredients in the Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) Official Publication to permit marketing of such ingredients in interstate commerce, provided there are no safety concerns regarding the use or composition of the ingredients. See Item 1A “Risk Factors - Our business may be affected by the impact of animal related disease, such as BSE and other food safety issues,” for more information regarding the BSE Feed Rule.

•The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), which has authority over meat, poultry, and egg products and inspects producers to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Within the USDA, two agencies exercise direct regulatory oversight of our activities:
Page 14


- Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) certifies facilities and claims made for exported materials to meet importing country requirements and establishes and enforces import requirements for live animals and animal by-products as well as plant products, and

- Food Safety and Inspection Service (“FSIS”) regulates sanitation and biosecurity of our facilities and our food safety programs at plants producing edible fats and meats, among other things.
In 2004, FSIS issued three interim final rules designed to enhance its BSE safeguards in order to minimize human exposure to BSE infective tissues and assure consumers of the safety of the meat supply.  These regulations prohibited non-ambulatory animals from entering the food chain, required removal of SRMs at slaughter and prohibited carcasses from cattle tested for BSE from entering the food chain until the animals tested negative for BSE, among other provisions. In 2007, FSIS published an affirmation of the interim final rules concerning prohibition of SRMs and non-ambulatory animals and the use of stunning devices, with several amendments.
In 2007, APHIS implemented revised import regulations to allow Canadian cattle 30 months of age and older and born on or after March 1, 1999, and bovine products derived from such cattle to be imported into the United States for any use, if such cattle and products complied with specific FDA and FSIS regulations. Imports of Canadian cattle younger than 30 months of age have been allowed since March 2005. Imports of SRMs from Canadian-born cattle slaughtered in Canada are not permitted. In 2014, APHIS implemented amended import regulations concerning cattle and bovine products. The final rule established a system for classifying regions as to BSE risk that is consistent with international standards set by the World Organization for Animal Health (“OIE”), and based importation requirements for cattle and beef products on: (i) the inherent risk of BSE infectivity in the commodity to be imported and (ii) the BSE risk status of the region from which the commodity originates.
•The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), which regulates air and water discharges and hazardous and solid waste requirements among other environmental requirements, as well as local and state environmental agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters affecting the Company's operations. The EPA also administers the National Renewable Fuel Standard Program (“RFS2”).
•The Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”), which is a voluntary membership association of state, and federal agencies that regulate the sale and distribution of animal feeds and animal drug remedies. Although, AAFCO has no regulatory authority, it brings together stakeholders and works to develop and implement uniform and equitable laws, regulations, standards, definitions, and enforcement polices for regulating the manufacture, labeling, distribution and sale of animal feeds. 
•State Departments of Agriculture, which regulate animal by-product collection and transportation procedures and animal feed quality.
•The United States Department of Transportation (“USDOT”), as well as local and state transportation agencies, which regulate the operation of our commercial vehicles.
