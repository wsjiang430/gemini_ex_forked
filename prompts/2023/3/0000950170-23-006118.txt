 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
We are a dermatology therapeutics company developing medications for skin diseases requiring medical intervention. We are primarily focused on developing clinician administered therapies in areas of high unmet need. Our current product pipeline consists of three product candidates: (i) VP-102, a propriety drug-device combination that contains a GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin which is being developed for potential use in treating molluscum contagiosum, external genital warts and common warts, (ii) VP-315, an oncolytic peptide-based injectable therapy for the potential treatment of dermatology oncologic conditions, including basal cell carcinoma, and (iii) VP-103, a second cantharidin based drug device combination for the potential treatment of plantar warts.
 Our lead product candidate, VP-102, is initially being developed for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum, a highly contagious and primarily pediatric viral skin disease. There are currently no products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, nor is there an established standard of care for any of these diseases, resulting in significant undertreated populations. Molluscum and common warts are two of the largest unmet needs in dermatology. VP-102 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for molluscum and for its active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, to be characterized as a new chemical entity, or NCE, with the five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity associated with that designation. We also believe VP-102 has the potential to qualify for pediatric exclusivity in common warts, which would provide for an additional six months of non-patent exclusivity. In addition, our granted patents and pending patent applications include claims drawn to our cantharidin formulations, applicator devices and related accessories, dosing regimens, methods of preparation including methods of synthesis, and methods of use.
 VP-102 - Treatment of Molluscum
 Molluscum is a highly contagious common skin disease caused by a pox virus that produces multiple raised flesh-colored papules, or skin lesions. Molluscum typically presents with 10 to 30 lesions and can present with over 100 lesions. If left untreated, molluscum lesions persist for an average of 13 months, with some cases remaining unresolved for more than two years. The symptoms of molluscum tend to cause considerable anxiety, and parents frequently seek treatment due to its highly contagious nature and physical appearance.
 We estimate approximately 6 million people in the United States have molluscum. Of the 6 million people with molluscum, we estimate that approximately 1 million are diagnosed annually. Molluscum has a 5% to 11% prevalence rate in children with the greatest incidence in individuals aged one to 14 years old. Accordingly, we estimate this represents a total addressable U.S. market of over $1 billion. We believe that the molluscum prevalence rate in the European Union and Asia is at least as high as in the United States.
 Compounded cantharidin has been used for many years by dermatologists to treat molluscum, but it has many limitations. Those limitations include that it is not FDA-approved, could have highly variable purity, is not readily available and is often not produced in accordance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP. In addition, the formulation and administration of compounded cantharidin is not standardized and is poorly controlled. Other existing therapies, such as cryotherapy, curettage and laser surgery are also used, but are often painful and may lead to scarring. The potential for scarring and pain makes many of these treatments particularly unsuitable for children. As a result, a significant need exists for a clinically proven and FDA-approved treatment for molluscum.
 We have designed VP-102 to address the significant limitations of current compounded cantharidin formulations, including with respect to safety, purity, efficacy, stability and ease of administration. VP-102 contains the first GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin with a defined pharmaceutical batch process and an API that is greater than 99% pure. We believe VP-102 addresses the shortcomings associated with current therapies, including pain and discomfort, potential scarring and inconsistent outcomes, and has the potential to be the first FDA-approved product for the treatment of molluscum.


In January 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. Based on the results from these trials, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in September 2019. In November 2019, we received notice that the FDA accepted the NDA for filing, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of July 13, 2020. In July 2020, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA for our NDA. We resubmitted our NDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in December 2020. In February 2021, we received notice that the FDA accepted the resubmitted NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of June 23, 2021. On May 28, 2021, the FDA extended the PDUFA date to September 23, 2021 to allow the Agency additional time to review information submitted by Verrica in response to comments from the agency regarding our human factors study.
 On September 17, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102. According to the CRL, the FDA identified deficiencies at a facility of Sterling Pharmaceutical Services, or Sterling, a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, which were unrelated to the manufacturing of VP-102 but instead raised general quality issues at the facility, predominately on the septic, or sterile side, of the facility. The FDA did not identify any clinical, safety or product specific CMC deficiencies related to VP-102. Following the CRL, on September 22, 2021, we received a General Advice Letter from the FDA with recommendations to improve VP-102’s user interface. On November 5, 2021, we were notified that the inspection of Sterling that had been classified as “voluntary action indicated”, or VAI, was closed and that the VAI classification would not directly negatively impact FDA’s assessment of our NDA regarding Sterling. With the satisfactory resolution of the facility inspection, we resubmitted the NDA for the approval of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum on November 29, 2021. The resubmission was limited to those sections and elements of the NDA that were identified as deficiencies in the CRL issued by the FDA in September 2021. The resubmission addressed the successful resolution of inspection deficiencies identified at Sterling in the CRL, as well as the recommendations included in the General Advice Letter received from the FDA that relate to VP-102’s user interface. On December 15, 2021 the FDA accepted our NDA resubmission for VP-102 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of May 24, 2022.
 On May 24, 2022, we announced that we received a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102 from the FDA. The only deficiency listed in the CRL was related to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection at a facility of Sterling that manufactured the bulk solution used in VP-102. Sterling received notice from the FDA on May 19, 2022 that as a result of the inspection, it is on "official action indicated", or OAI, status. This classification resulted from a week-long reinspection of Sterling conducted by the FDA in February 2022 but none of the issues identified by the FDA during the reinspection were specific to the manufacture of VP-102. We were also informed by the FDA that it had completed its review of our NDA and product label, there were no open questions on the NDA review, and the VP-102 label was ready to be communicated. On June 27, 2022 we held a Type A meeting with the FDA regarding the path forward for the resubmission and potential approval of the NDA for VP-102. During the Type A meeting the FDA indicated that it could not accept our NDA resubmission with Sterling listed as the primary manufacturer of the bulk solution for VP-102 if Sterling was on OAI status at the time of resubmission. Following the FDA’s commentary, we selected a new CMO partner to produce the bulk solution, Piramal Pharma Solutions, and the technology transfer process was completed in January 2023. On January 23, 2023 we resubmitted the NDA for VP-102 to the FDA. The FDA accepted our NDA resubmission on February 27, 2023 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of July 23, 2023.
 VP-102 - Treatment of External Genital Warts
 In addition, we are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of external genital warts, or EGW. EGW is a viral skin disease caused by the human papilloma virus, or HPV, which forms lesions on the surface of the skin. An estimated 17% of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of EGW. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the optimal dose regimen, efficacy, safety and tolerability of VP-102 in patients with EGW in June 2019. In November 2020, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of EGW. An end of Phase 2 meeting was held with the FDA in May 2021. We intend to initiate a Phase 3 trial of VP-102 for the treatment of EGW and to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024.
VP-102 - Treatment of Common Warts
 We are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. Common warts typically result in two to five lesions. We estimate approximately 22 million people in the United States have common warts and the total addressable U.S. market to be over $1 billion with an estimated 2 million patient visits for common warts each year. In the United States, approximately 50% of the patients who seek treatment for common warts are children, and approximately 25% of common warts patients are treated by pediatricians. We believe that the common wart patient opportunity in the European Union and Asia is at least as large as that in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved products indicated for the treatment of common warts. While common warts can be treated with slow acting, over-the-counter products, the warts tend to be highly refractory and a cause for multiple consultations. We believe that cantharidin’s role as a widely recognized and effective blistering agent for the treatment of skin lesions, coupled with VP-102’s safety and efficacy data in clinical trials for the treatment of molluscum and convenient ease of administration, will allow VP-102 to address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies. In June 2019, we announced positive topline results from our COVE-1 Phase 2 open label clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. COVE-1 included two cohorts that evaluated the safety and efficacy of VP-102 in subjects with up to six warts.
 Based on feedback from the FDA regarding our Phase 3 program in common warts, we are currently evaluating the benefits of conducting an additional Phase 2 clinical trial that would be designed to further evaluate the treatment indication, application time, or regimen and long-term sustainability.
VP-315 - Treatment of Dermatological Oncology
 We are also developing VP-315 for the treatment of dermatological oncology indications. We obtained an exclusive worldwide license from Lytix BioPharma AS, or Lytix, to develop and commercialize VP-315 for dermatologic oncology indications, including non-metastatic melanoma and non-metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, and we intend to focus initially on basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas as the lead indications for development. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of cancer in the U.S., and incidence is rising worldwide. There are approximately 3-4 million diagnoses of basal cell carcinomas in the U.S. each year, with a high unmet need for new treatment options.
The FDA accepted our IND in November 2021. We dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 trial of VP-315 in Basal Cell Carcinoma, in April 2022. The Phase 2 trial is a three-part, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept trial of VP-315 when administered intratumorally to adults with biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma. Part 1 of the trial is designed to evaluate VP-315’s safety profile when administered in escalating doses to individual subjects. Part 2 is designed to confirm the exploratory dose from Part 1 and identify the recommended dose for Part 3. Part 3 is designed to evaluate the efficacy profile of the two selected doses of VP-315 and determine the optimal therapeutic dose. We enrolled 10 patients in Part 1 of the trial. In Part 1, VP-315 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no reported serious adverse events. We expect to initiate Part 2 of the trial in the second quarter of 2023 and Part 3 of the trial in the second half of 2023.
VP-103 - Treatment of Plantar Warts
 We are developing our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts. An estimated one-third of the approximately 4.1 million annual patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of plantar warts, which are warts located on the bottom of the foot.
We are conducting necessary drug development activities for VP-103 and are evaluating when to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of plantar warts.
We believe we have the opportunity to expand our proprietary cantharidin formulations for the treatment of additional dermatological conditions with high unmet needs.

 License Agreements
 On March 17, 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Torii Agreement, with Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Torii, pursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan. Additionally, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation with respect to additional indications for the licensed products and certain additional products for use in the licensed field, in each case in Japan. Pursuant to the Torii Agreement, we received payments from Torii of $0.5 million in December 2020 and $11.5 million in April 2021. On July 25, 2022 Torii dosed the first patient in its Phase 3 trial of VP-102 (referred to as TO-208 in Japan) for molluscum contagiosum in Japan, triggering an $8.0 million milestone payment recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we are entitled to receive from Torii an additional $50.0 million in aggregate payments contingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales milestones, in addition to tiered transfer price payments for supply of product in the percentage range of the mid-30s to the mid-40s of net sales. We recognized collaboration revenue of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to supplies and development activity pursuant to this agreement.
 In August 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Lytix pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license for certain technology of Lytix to develop VP-315 for use in all malignant and pre-malignant dermatological indications, other than metastatic melanoma and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.

VP-102 for the Treatment of Molluscum
 We are developing VP-102 as a proprietary drug-device combination of a novel 0.7% w/v topical solution of cantharidin administered through our single-use precision applicator. VP-102 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved treatment for molluscum and we believe it will address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies, including pain and discomfort, scarring and lack of effectiveness.
 We have designed VP-102 to address the significant limitations of current compounded cantharidin formulations for the treatment of molluscum, with respect to safety, purity, efficacy, stability and ease of administration. VP-102 contains the first GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin with a defined pharmaceutical batch process and an API that is greater than 99% pure.
 Our proprietary single-use applicator allows for precise application to each lesion. Our applicator contains a sealed glass ampule providing long-term room temperature stability without the changes in concentration due to evaporation seen in compounded formulations.

Phase 3 Clinical Trials—CAMP-1 and CAMP-2
 In January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 pivotal trials with VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. The two trials, identical in design, were randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum. CAMP-1 was conducted under a SPA with the FDA. The primary objective of the trials was to evaluate the efficacy of dermal application of VP-102 relative to placebo in subjects 2 years of age and older with molluscum, when treated once every 21 days for up to four applications, by assessing the proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Day 84 (Week 12/End of Study visit). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects with complete clearance at study visits on Days 21 (Week 3), 42 (Week 6) and 63 (Week 9).
 CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 enrolled 528 subjects in total and were conducted at 31 centers in the United States. Results from CAMP-1 and CAMP-2 showed 46% and 54% of subjects treated with VP-102, respectively, achieved complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Day 84 versus 18% and 13% of subjects in the placebo groups (p<0.0001). By Day 84, VP-102 treated subjects had a 69% and 83% mean reduction in the number of molluscum lesions, a pre-specified endpoint, in CAMP-1 and CAMP-2, respectively, compared to a 20% increase and a 19% reduction for subjects on placebo.
 Consistent with the results from the Phase 2 clinical trials, VP-102 was also well-tolerated in the Phase 3 trials, with side effects that were primarily mild to moderate. The most frequently reported adverse events were application site reactions that are well-known, reversible side effects related to the mechanism of action of cantharidin, a blistering agent, which is the active ingredient in VP-102. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in CAMP-1 or CAMP-2.
 Based on the results of these trials, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in September 2019. In November 2019, we received notice that the FDA accepted the NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of July 13, 2020. In July 2020, we received a CRL, from the FDA for our NDA. We resubmitted our NDA for VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in December 2020. In February 2021, we received notice that the FDA accepted the resubmitted NDA for filing, with a PDUFA goal date of June 23, 2021. On May 28, 2021 the FDA extended the PDUFA date to September 23, 2021 to allow the Agency additional time to review information submitted by Verrica in response to comments from the agency regarding our human factors study.
 On September 17, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102. According to the CRL, the FDA identified deficiencies at a facility of Sterling, which were unrelated to the manufacturing of VP-102 but instead raised general quality issues at the facility. The FDA did not identify any clinical, safety or product specific CMC deficiencies related to VP-102. Following the CRL, on September 22, 2021 we received a General Advice Letter from the FDA with recommendations to improve VP-102’s user interface. On November 5, 2021, we were notified that the inspection of Sterling that had been classified as “voluntary action indicated”, or VAI, was closed and that the VAI classification would not directly negatively impact FDA’s assessment of our NDA regarding Sterling. With the satisfactory resolution of the facility inspection, we resubmitted the NDA for the approval of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum on November 29, 2021. The resubmission was limited to those sections and elements of the NDA that were identified as deficiencies in the CRL issued by the FDA in September 2021. The resubmission addressed the successful resolution of inspection deficiencies identified at Sterling in the CRL, as well as the recommendations included in the General Advice Letter received from the FDA that relate to VP-102’s user interface. On December 15, 2021 the FDA accepted our NDA resubmission for VP-102 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of May 24, 2022.
 On May 24, 2022, we announced that we received a CRL regarding our NDA for VP-102 from the FDA. The only deficiency listed in the CRL was related to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection at a facility of Sterling that manufactured the bulk solution used in VP-102. Sterling received notice from the FDA on May 19, 2022 that as a result of the inspection, it was on "official action indicated", or OAI, status. This classification resulted from a week-long reinspection of Sterling conducted by the FDA in February 2022 but none of the issues identified by the FDA during the reinspection were specific to the manufacture of VP-102. We were also informed by the FDA that it had completed its review of our NDA and product label, there were no open questions on the NDA review, and the VP-102 label was ready to be communicated. On June 27, 2022 we held a Type A meeting

with the FDA regarding the path forward for the resubmission and potential approval of the NDA for VP-102. During the Type A meeting the FDA indicated that it could not accept our NDA resubmission with Sterling listed as the primary manufacturer of the bulk solution for VP-102 if Sterling was on OAI status at the time of resubmission. Following the FDA’s commentary, we selected a new CMO partner to produce the bulk solution, Piramal Pharma Solutions, and the technology transfer process was completed in January 2023. We resubmitted the NDA on January 23, 2023. The FDA accepted our NDA resubmission on February 27, 2023 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of July 23, 2023.
 VP-102 for the Treatment of External Genital Warts
 We are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of EGW. EGW is a viral skin disease caused by HPV which forms lesions on the surface of the skin. An estimated 17% of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of EGW. We believe VP-102 may have the potential to offer a safe and effective treatment for EGW because of the shared characteristics with molluscum. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the optimal dose regimen, efficacy, safety and tolerability of VP-102 in patients with EGW in June 2019, as summarized in the table below. In November 2020, we announced positive results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of EGW.
The Phase 2 trial was comprised of two parts. The primary objective for Part A was to evaluate three regimens of application of VP-102 (2-hour, 6-hour, 24-hour duration of skin exposure) in subjects with EGW and identify the two best regimens by assessing safety and tolerability of VP-102 when administered topically after subjects completed a 48-hour assessment. The primary objective for Part B was to evaluate two regimens of application of VP-102 in subjects with EGW and identify the regimen with the best risk benefit profile when administered topically once every 21 days for up to 4 applications.
 For the Part A and B intent-to-treat, or ITT, population, statistically significant complete clearance of EGW was observed for both VP-102 treatment groups versus their respective placebo treatment groups by treatment visit 4 and was maintained through Day 84 end of treatment, or EOT. Complete clearance of EGW was observed for subjects treated with VP-102 through the Follow-up Study Day 112 and the Day 147, end of study visit, or EOS, but the differences were not statistically significant versus subjects treated with placebo. For all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed, VP-102 was effective in reducing the number and size of EGW in this subject population, demonstrating statistical significance versus placebo. Efficacy results were comparable between the VP-102 6-hour and VP-102 24-hour treatment groups at Day 84 EOT. However, results of secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses demonstrated trends suggesting earlier response and sustained response of the VP-102 24-hour treatment group. Both the VP-102 6-hour and VP-102 24-hour treatment groups presented comparable and favorable safety profiles, with most adverse events being local skin responses related to the mechanism of action of cantharidin. The adverse event profile and efficacy demonstrated in this trial support the conclusion that the 24-hour exposure regimen represents an acceptable risk benefit profile and the conduct of a larger placebo-controlled Phase 3 study is warranted.

 Based on the results of the Phase 2 trial, an end of Phase 2 meeting was held with the FDA in May 2021. We intend to initiate the Phase 3 trial of VP-102 for the treatment of EGW in the second half of 2024. The Phase 3 program (CARE-2) will consist of two identical trials as well as a pharmacokinetics, or PK study, as required for registration. The trials are designed to be double-blind, randomized and vehicle-controlled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VP-102 in subjects with EGW. The trials utilize a treatment interval of 21 days with a maximum of up to four treatments, which is consistent with the previous Phase 2 trial. We expect approximately 25 sites will be utilized for each of the two trials. We expect approximately 410 subjects will be enrolled in each trial with the goal to have an aggregate of approximately 532 subjects complete the trials.
 We are designing the PK study to determine any potential systemic exposure to cantharidin from a single 24-hour topical application of VP-102 using Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).
  VP-102 for the Treatment of Common Warts
 We are also developing VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. Published studies and clinical use provide support for cantharidin as a safe and effective treatment for common warts. We believe that VP-102 has the potential to address many of the shortcomings associated with current therapies, including pain and discomfort, scarring, and lack of effectiveness. In addition, we believe VP-102’s convenient ease of administration will differentiate it from existing alternative unapproved therapies.
 We conducted an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial (COVE-1) to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VP-102 in subjects with up to six common warts. In this study, there were two cohorts. Cohort 1 was conducted at a single site with 21 subjects age 2 years and older receiving up to 4 treatments with VP-102 at least 14 days between treatments with longer treatment intervals allowed at the discretion of the investigator depending on a specific subject’s clinical response. Cohort 2 was conducted at four sites with 35 subjects age 12 years and older receiving up to 4 treatments with VP-102 every 21 days. Paring of warts, a technique commonly used by dermatologists to prepare the wart for treatment, was allowed in Cohort 2 to remove any adherent thick scale from a wart prior to application of VP-102. The primary objective of both cohorts was to evaluate the efficacy of up to 4 dermal applications of VP-102 when applied to common warts by assessing the proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of all treatable warts at Day 84. Complete clearance of warts at Day 84 for Cohort 1 was observed in 19.0% of subjects, and for Cohort 2 complete clearance was observed in 51.4% of subjects. By Day 84, there was a mean decrease from baseline in the number of warts of 31.2% for Cohort 1 subjects and 53.8% for Cohort 2 subjects. In both cohorts, the most frequently reported adverse events were anticipated application site skin reactions that were primarily mild or moderate in intensity, including vesicles, pain, erythema, pruritus, scabbing, dryness, edema, and post-inflammatory pigmentation changes. There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported, and there were no adverse events leading to trial drug discontinuation.

Based on feedback from the FDA regarding a potential Phase 3 trial protocol, we are currently evaluating conducting an additional Phase 2 clinical trial of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts.
VP-315 for the Treatment of Dermatological Oncology Indications
We are developing our product candidate, VP-315, for the treatment of dermatological oncology indications. The FDA accepted our IND in November 2021. We dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 trial of VP-315 in Basal Cell Carcinoma in April 2022. The Phase 2 trial is a three-part, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept trial of VP-315 when administered intratumorally to adults with biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma. Part 1 of the trial is designed to evaluate VP-315’s safety profile when administered in escalating doses to individual subjects. Part 2 is designed to confirm the exploratory dose from Part 1 and identify the recommended dose for Part 3. Part 3 is designed to evaluate the efficacy profile of the two selected doses of VP-315 and determine the optimal therapeutic dose. We enrolled 10 patients in Part 1 of the trial. In Part 1, VP-315 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no reported serious adverse events. We expect to initiate Part 2 of the trial in the second quarter of 2023 and Part 3 of the trial in the second half of 2023.
 In total, the trial is expected to enroll approximately 66 adult subjects with a histological diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma in at least one eligible target lesion. Both clinical and histological clearance of treated lesion(s) at excision will be assessed
 VP-103 for the Treatment of Plantar Warts
 We are also developing our second cantharidin-based product candidate, VP-103, for the treatment of plantar warts, which are warts located on the bottom of the foot. An estimated one-third of the approximately 4.1 million patient visits for all types of warts are for the treatment of plantar warts. To date, plantar warts have been difficult to treat, as they are refractory and available treatments often lead to both pain and scarring. We are conducting necessary drug development activities for VP-103 and are evaluating when to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of plantar warts.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We have been relying on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and will continue to rely on these third parties in the near term for the commercial manufacture of our drug products if they are approved during the initial commercial phase. Manufacturing of the API for our product candidates requires a raw material that is derived from a natural source.


To date, we have obtained naturally-sourced cantharidin directly or indirectly from our supplier based in the People’s Republic of China. On July 16, 2018, we entered into a Supply Agreement, or the Supply Agreement, with Funing County Development Brucea Javanica Professional Cooperatives, or the Supplier, pursuant to which the Supplier has agreed to supply naturally-sourced cantharidin to us for a specified fixed price. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, the Supplier has agreed that it will not supply cantharidin, any beetles or other raw material from which cantharidin is derived to any other customer in North America, subject to specified minimum annual purchase orders and forecasts.
Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, we have provided the Supplier with purchase orders in 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 and may submit additional purchase orders from time to time, so long as the purchase orders are at least six months prior to the proposed delivery date. As of January 31, 2023, we held inventories of approximately 120,000 finished drug product applicators in various stages of completion and possessed total inventories in a combination of raw cantharidin and converted API adequate to produce over 17 million additional finished drug product applicators in the United States, with additional raw cantharidin already manufactured awaiting shipment.
The term of the Supply Agreement is five years and thereafter will be renewed automatically for 12-month periods, unless terminated by either party at least 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term. In addition, either party has the right to terminate the Supply Agreement under certain circumstances, including (i) upon a material breach of the Supply Agreement if the breaching party has failed to remedy the breach within 45 days or if the breach is not capable of remedy within 45 days or (ii) the other party becomes insolvent or goes into liquidation.
Our contract manufacturers and primary packaging vendor are FDA-registered establishments and have a history of supplying products to the pharmaceutical industry.
 We have demonstrated capability to successfully manufacture the API the bulk drug intermediate, filled ampules and assembled applicators at our proposed commercial batch sizes. Validation activities for the commercial manufacturing and assembly processes have been completed. Given the nature of both the API as well as several of the excipients, special handling will be required to minimize risks to personnel during processing. Analytical testing methods for both the API as well as the finished drug product have been developed and qualified. It is expected that these existing methods will prove appropriate for release of commercial product.
Our proprietary individual applicator and its parts are fabricated using common methods and materials and we currently plan to have our applicators built using semi-custom equipment performing well established automated assembly techniques. This equipment has successfully undergone initial engineering feasibility evaluations. As part of the proposed resolution to FDA comments in the CRL regarding the human factors validation, we have designed and developed an accessory to facilitate the preparation of the applicator assembly by the healthcare professional. The proposed commercial applicator assembly and this accessory have successfully undergone both engineering testing as well as evaluation in a simulated clinical setting.
 Commercialization
 We intend to commercialize VP-102, or any other product candidates that we may successfully develop, in the United States by building a specialized sales organization focused on pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists and select pediatricians. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 50 to 60 sales representatives would allow us to reach the approximately 400 pediatric dermatologists and 9,000 dermatologists in the United States with the highest potential for using VP-102. In the future, we may develop and commercialize VP-102 for additional geographic regions, independently or with a strategic partner. For instance, on March 17, 2021, we entered into the Torii Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of cantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including VP-102. Additionally, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation with respect to additional indications for the licensed products and certain additional products for use in the licensed field, in each case in Japan.
We intend to seek drug product reimbursement for VP-102. Based on a survey of 40 physicians that we commissioned, 87% of physicians reported they would use VP-102 if the cost of the drug were covered. Furthermore, we have commissioned market research and met with payor organizations representing over 205 million lives. The surveyed payors recognized that there is a significant unmet need for molluscum and a current lack of an effective treatment. Given the unmet need and the results of clinical trials of VP-102 to date, the surveyed payors anticipate the majority of patients would have access to VP-102, if approved, with minimal to no restrictions.

We believe dermatologists tend to be particularly focused on the safety of pharmaceutical products because, while skin diseases can have profound effects on patients’ quality of life, few are life-threatening. As a result, we believe that dermatologists, as well as their patients, often prefer to use topical treatments when possible to limit the risk of systemic side effects. Dermatologists also tend to place a high level of emphasis on products that are easy to use because they often manage high volumes of patients. We believe this also contributes to a general preference for topical treatments. Finally, in our experience, dermatologists tend to engage with sales and medical affairs personnel from the pharmaceutical industry regarding the scientific evidence supporting dermatology products and the challenges experienced by physicians and patients in the use of these products. Dermatologists often rely on trusted relationships with scientifically oriented, customer-focused sales representatives who can provide them with the necessary information to support their use of appropriate treatments.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, compounding facilities, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of VP-102, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and stability. With respect to VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, we will be primarily competing with therapies such as other topical products, curettage, cryotherapy, laser surgery, natural oils, off-label drugs, natural remedies and compounded unstandardized cantharidin. Under Section 503A of the FDCA, if VP-102 is approved, compounded topical cantharidin products with the same, similar or an easily substitutable dosage strength would be considered essentially copies of VP-102 and may not be compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts, subject to certain limited individual exceptions. These exceptions include if there is a difference between the compounded product and VP-102 that is made for an individual patient, and a prescribing practitioner determines produces a significant difference for that patient. In addition, pursuant to Section 503B of the FDCA, once VP-102 is approved, compounding facilities registered as outsourcing facilities would not be able to compound cantharidin products, unless there is a difference from VP-102 that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient, as determined by a prescribing practitioner. With respect to VP-102 for EGW, we will be competing with cryosurgery, laser surgery, and topical destructive therapies such as trichloroacetic acid. There are also several FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical therapies for EGW including imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins. In addition, EGW are caused by HPV and may be prevented or treated by HPV vaccines that are FDA-approved. With respect to VP-102 for common warts and VP-103 for plantar warts, we will primarily be competing with over-the-counter products, cryotherapy, curettage, laser surgery, or other off-label therapies. There are currently no FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of molluscum, common warts, or plantar warts.
 We are aware of several other product candidates in development as potential treatments for the indications we intend to target. Novan has submitted a NDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for the topical treatment of molluscum contagiosum. There are a number of other companies developing products for common warts. In addition, other drugs have been used off label as treatments for molluscum and common warts.
A number of other companies are in various stages of developing treatments for basal cell carcinoma. Although surgery is historically the most common treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma, several companies are working on non-surgical alternative treatments due to the risk of disfigurement, infection and scarring seen from more invasive treatments. At least three companies are currently conducting trials for superficial basal cell carcinoma and several companies who already have FDA approval to treat more advanced and metastatic cancers, are conducting trials to expand their indications to include locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma.
Intellectual Property
 In addition to our five year regulatory exclusivity, the extent of our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for VP-102, including our proprietary cantharidin formulation and applicator and any of our future product candidates, medical devices, synthetic methodologies, novel

discoveries, drug development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our product candidate and other proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 While we seek broad coverage under our pending patent applications, our granted patents and pending patent applications do not include any claims drawn to the active pharmaceutical agent cantharidin per se or for the broad use of our API alone for the treatment of warts or molluscum. However, our granted patents and pending patent applications do claim, for example, our cantharidin formulations, applicator devices and related accessories, dosing regimens, methods of preparation including methods of synthesis, and methods of use. Despite these patent filings, there is always a risk that modification of the specific formulation, manufacturing process, method of application of cantharidin to the skin and/or specific method of use may allow a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents, if granted, will expire, and we cannot provide any assurance that any additional patents will issue from our pending or any future patent applications.
 We currently have two issued United States patents covering the cantharidin formulation of VP-102, applicator devices and systems comprising the formulation, and methods of using the same, e.g., for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Excluding any patent term extension, these two U.S. patents will expire on May 28, 2035 and August 22, 2038, respectively. Additionally, we have granted patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Mexico covering our proprietary cantharidin formulations, applicator devices and systems comprising the formulations, and methods of using the same.
We also currently have one issued United States design patent covering the design of our VP-102 applicator. This issued U.S. design patent will expire on October 27, 2035. Additionally, we have granted design patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea and United Kingdom, as well as allowed design patent applications in the United States and Mexico, covering the design of our proprietary ampule crush tool for use with our VP-102 applicator.
 In addition, we currently have two United States patents covering methods of preparing and purifying cantharidin. We also have granted patents in Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, and Mexico, as well as an allowed patent application in Israel, covering methods of preparing cantharidin. Additionally, we have a granted patent in Japan covering methods of purifying cantharidin.
 As of February 2, 2023, we have nationalized six international PCT patent applications for utility patents, five of which have been nationalized in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico, and one of which has been nationalized in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Five of these European patent applications have been registered in Hong Kong. These patent applications relate to VP-102, including our proprietary cantharidin formulation and applicator, and other inventions related to VP-102. Our patent applications related to VP-102 include proposed claims relating to (i) methods for the synthesis of cantharidin, (ii) our specific formulations and preparations of VP-102, (iii) methods for purifying cantharidin, (iv) methods for detecting impurities in cantharidin, (v) the design of our proprietary applicator, including both the general design and specific design elements, (vi) claims related to safety features included in the VP-102 formulation, including colorants and bittering agents, and (vii) methods of administration of VP-102 for the treatment of skin lesions. In addition to the foregoing, we currently have one pending international PCT patent application covering our proprietary ampule crush tool for use with our VP-102 applicator. We have also filed a United States design patent covering the design of our VP-102 applicator, and design patent applications covering the design of the ampule crush tool in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and the United States. Excluding any patent term adjustment and patent term extension, any additional utility patents to issue from these patent applications are projected to expire between 2034 and 2041. Any additional design patents to issue from our pending design patent applications will each expire fifteen years from the date of issuance. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether any additional patents will issue from these patent applications or, if any patents do issue, the scope of the claims that will be allowed.


Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries, in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued from applications in the United States are granted for a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent’s term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in examining and issuing the patent, and extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the drug, and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Lytix License Agreement
 On August 7, 2020, we entered into the Lytix Agreement, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, for certain technology of Lytix to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize VP-315 for use in all malignant and pre-malignant dermatological indications, other than metastatic melanoma and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. Our right to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient is limited to certain instances, and Lytix is obligated to manufacture and supply our clinical and commercial needs for such active pharmaceutical ingredient. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to commercialize the product, which development and commercialization will be overseen by a joint steering committee. Lytix has agreed not to pursue any products in the field of dermatology other than VP-315 for use in metastatic melanoma and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. Lytix has granted us an exclusive option to negotiate for an exclusive license for use of the active ingredient in VP-315 in additional dermatological indications.
 In connection with entering the Lytix Agreement, we made initial payment of $250,000. We made additional payments of $2.25 million in February 2021 and $1.0 million in May 2022 upon the achievement by Lytix of a regulatory milestone. Additionally, we are obligated to pay up to $111.0 million contingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales milestones, and tiered royalties based on worldwide annual net sales ranging in the low double digits to the mid-teens, subject to certain customary reductions. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire licensed patent covering the active ingredient of VP-315 anywhere in the world and expiration of regulatory exclusivity for VP-315 in such country. Additionally, all upfront fees and milestone-based payments received by us from a sublicensee will be treated as net sales and will be subject to the royalty payment obligations under the Lytix Agreement, and all royalties received by us from a sublicensee shall be shared with Lytix at a rate that is initially 50% but decreases based on the stage of development of VP-315 at the time such sublicense is granted.


The Lytix Agreement expires on a product-by-product and a country-by-country basis upon expiration of the royalty term for such product in such country. At any time after the first anniversary of the execution of the Lytix Agreement, we have the right to terminate the agreement, either on a region-by-region basis or in its entirety, upon specified written notice to Lytix. Lytix may terminate the agreement, either on a region-by-region basis or in its entirety, if we develop or commercialize a competing product in the licensed field, or in its entirety if we challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent, subject in each case to certain cure rights. Either party may terminate the Lytix Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party.
 Torii Collaboration and License Agreement
 In August 2020, we entered into an option agreement with Torii for the development and commercialization of our product candidates for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including VP-102, or the Option Agreement. Torii paid us $0.5 million to secure the exclusive option. The $0.5 million is included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 in the balance sheet.
On March 2, 2021, Torii exercised the exclusive option in the Option Agreement. On March 17, 2021, we entered into the Torii Agreement with Torii, pursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of cantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including VP-102. Additionally, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation with respect to additional indications for the licensed products and certain additional products for use in the licensed field, in each case in Japan.
 Under the Torii Agreement, Torii is responsible for all development activities and specified costs in support of obtaining regulatory approval of the licensed products in Japan, provided, that Torii’s activities will be overseen by a joint steering committee. Torii is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all development necessary to obtain regulatory approval for licensed products in Japan, to obtain and maintain such approvals, and to commercialize licensed products upon receipt of such approvals.
 Pursuant to the Torii Agreement, we received payments from Torii of $0.5 million in December 2020 and $11.5 million in April 2021. On July 25, 2022 Torii dosed the first patient in its Phase 3 trial of VP-102 (referred to as TO-208 in Japan) for molluscum contagiosum in Japan, triggering an $8.0 million milestone payment recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we are entitled to receive from Torii an additional $50.0 million in aggregate payments contingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales milestones, in addition to tiered transfer price payments for supply of product in the percentage range of the mid-30s to the mid-40s of net sales. The transfer payments shall be payable, on a product-by-product basis, beginning on the first commercial sale of such product and ending on the latest of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim contained in certain licensed patents in Japan that cover such product, (b) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the first indication for such product in Japan, and, (c) (i) with respect to the first product, ten years after first commercial sale of such product, and, (ii) with respect to any other product, the later of (x) ten years after first commercial sale of the first product and (y) five years after first commercial sale of such product.
 On March 7, 2022, pursuant to the Torii Agreement, we entered into a Clinical Supply Agreement with Torii, whereby we are obligated to supply product to Torii for use in clinical trials and other development activities. We recognized billed and unbilled collaboration revenue of $0.9 million and $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, related to supplies and development activity pursuant to this agreement.
 The Torii Agreement expires on a product-by-product basis upon expiration of Torii’s obligation under the agreement to make transfer price payments for such product. Torii has the right to terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to us. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by, or insolvency of, the other party. We may terminate the agreement in the event that Torii commences a legal action challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patents.


Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various chemistry, manufacturing and controls, preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA together with payment of the applicable user fee;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing, an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 VP-102 is designed to be administered to patients via a proprietary applicator by a healthcare professional. In the United States, products composed of components that would normally be regulated by different centers at the FDA are known as combination products. Typically, the FDA’s Office of Combination Products assigns a combination product to a specific agency center as the lead reviewer. The FDA determines which center will lead a product’s review based upon the product’s primary mode of action. Depending on the type of combination product, its approval, clearance or licensure may usually be obtained through the submission of a single marketing application. VP-102 will be regulated as a drug device combination product, and the FDA has permitted a single regulatory submission seeking approval of VP-102 with the applicator in each indication for which we seek approval. Even when a single marketing application is required for a combination product, such as an NDA for a

combination pharmaceutical and device product, both the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health may participate in the review. An applicant will also need to discuss with the agency how to apply certain premarket requirements and post-marketing regulatory requirements, including conduct of clinical trials, adverse event reporting and good manufacturing practices, to their combination product.
 Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective and a clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.


Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls data and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has sixty days from receipt to make a decision as to whether the application has been accepted for filing.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthored, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.


After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional chemistry, manufacturing and controls documentation, clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, post approval submission, and FDA review and approval.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins for a SPA to be approved. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA and made part of the administrative record.
 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:
 •public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
 •a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
 •the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding by the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. A SPA, however, does not guarantee that a trial will be successful.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement

certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification.
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval.
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. Specifically, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. This exclusivity period may be extended by an additional six months if certain requirements are met to qualify the product for pediatric exclusivity, including the receipt of a written request from the FDA that we conduct certain pediatric studies, the submission of study reports from such studies to the FDA after receipt of the written request and satisfaction of the conditions specified in the written request.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.


Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market or if requested by the Sponsor. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential FDA enforcement actions include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. Companies may also share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgement, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Promotional materials distributed by companies must be submitted to the FDA on the date of first use.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and state laws that limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Regulation of Compounding Pharmacies
 Compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. Although we are not engaged in compounding, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our product candidate VP-102 has historically been used in the compounding of topical pharmaceutical products, and we could be subject to competition by compounders upon approval of VP-102, subject to the requirements set forth in Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA.
 Section 503A of the FDCA exempts licensed pharmacists or licensed physicians who compound products for identified, individual patients, based on the receipt of a valid prescription order, from the FDCA’s new drug approval requirements, cGMP requirements, and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions include that the pharmacist or physician does not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts any drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product, unless there is a difference between the compounded product and the commercially available product that is made for an individual patient, and which the prescribing practitioner determines produces a significant difference for that patient. The FDA has interpreted this prohibition to mean that the compounding of a product with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as a commercially available drug, that has the same, similar, or an easily substitutable dosage strength as the commercially available drug, and that can be used by the same route of administration as the commercially available drug, cannot be conducted under Section 503A usually, very often, or at regular times or intervals, or more frequently or in larger quantities than needed to address unanticipated emergency circumstance, unless the limited exception described above applies.


In addition, compounding under Section 503A may only use bulk drug substances that appear on a list issued by FDA through regulations, and/or that comply with certain other conditions specified in the statute.
 Unlike Section 503A, Section 503B of the FDCA allows certain entities to compound drugs that are not necessarily prepared in response to prescriptions for identified, individual patients. Such facilities must register with the FDA as outsourcing facilities, and once registered (including payment of a fee), the outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be exempt from the FDCA’s approval requirements and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use. Under Section 503B, a drug must be compounded in compliance with cGMP, by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in order to be so exempt. The outsourcing facility must also report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months, and information about the compounded products, such as the source of the active ingredients used to compound pursuant to Section 503B(b)(2). If the outsourcing facility compounds using bulk drug substances, the bulk drug substances must either appear on a list established by the FDA of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need or be used to compound drugs that appear on a list established by the FDA of drugs for which there is a shortage. Although the FDA has not yet established a list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need, the FDA has announced an interim policy pursuant to which bulk drug substances may be nominated for inclusion on such list and, provided certain conditions are met, outsourcing facilities may compound with such bulk drug substances pending evaluation of the substances for inclusion on the FDA’s list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. Cantharidin is currently listed among those nominated substances for which bulk drug substance may be used in compounding by outsourcing facilities pending FDA’s evaluation. In March 2019, the FDA issued Guidance for Industry addressing the criteria by which the FDA intends to evaluate whether there exists a clinical need for compounding with a bulk drug substance, including, in the case of a bulk drug substance that is a component of an FDA-approved drug, an evaluation of whether there exists an attribute of the approved drug that makes it medically unsuitable to treat certain patients; whether the drug product proposed to be compounded is intended to address that attribute; and whether the drug product proposed to be compounded must be compounded from a bulk drug substance rather than from the finished, FDA-approved drug product. As FDA has implemented these criteria as in the final Guidance for Industry, and if VP-102 is approved, an outsourcing facility would need to satisfy these criteria before being permitted to compound a cantharidin product using bulk cantharidin.
 In addition, an outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in Section 503B, including reporting adverse events and labeling compounded products with certain information. Registered outsourcing facilities are prohibited from selling compounded drugs through a wholesale distributor, or from compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs. A drug is “essentially a copy of an approved drug” if it is identical or nearly identical to an approved drug, which the FDA has interpreted to mean that it has the same active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, dosage strength and excipients as the approved drug, or if it has the same active ingredient as an approved drug and there is not a change from the approved drug that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient, as determined by the prescribing practitioner. Registered outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and FDA conducts inspections on a risk-based frequency under Section 503B(b)(4) of the FDCA.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.


The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and other individuals and entities on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
 In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute.
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, independent contractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access, or otherwise process individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), teaching hospitals, and other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.


We may also be subject to state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; as well as state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Market acceptance and sales of any drug products depend in part on coverage and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for drug products will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Coverage and reimbursement for our product also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum, external genital warts, and/or common warts. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-party payors may package the cost of the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our product. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Additionally, in the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided is made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement.
 Third-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures for the treatment of molluscum, external genital warts, and/or common warts in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement.
 Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.


Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the demand for our product candidates, to the extent that customers who are prescribed our product candidates, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates.
Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (i) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (ii) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (iii) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (iv) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; (v) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; (vi) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (vii) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, there have been a number of health reform initiatives by the Biden administration that have impacted the ACA. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of

2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, for example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. . It is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 22 full-time employees. All of our employees are located in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
