Our Mission
Improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.
Overview
Lyft, Inc (the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. 
We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massive societal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing drivers using our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.
We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility. 
Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership. Additionally, for those Lyft riders who have a car, we also offer car maintenance, roadside assistance, and parking to meet them where they are in their transportation journey.
Substantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive, Lyft Rentals renters, car owners that use services available in the Lyft app, and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In the second quarter of 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (“PBSC”). 
We have made focused and substantial investments in support of our mission. For example, to continually launch new innovations on our platform, we have invested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community, cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerful multimodal platform and scaled user network. 
To advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of car ownership and freedom to do and see more. Through our LyftUp initiatives, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We are also proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. 
Our values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time. As we recover from the impacts of COVID-19, we remain confident the demand for our offerings will continue to grow as more and more people discover new ways to experience Lyft, such as our bike and scooter offerings and even Lyft Pink, which offers riders exclusive perks and benefits.
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact communities globally. In March 2020, when it became apparent that COVID-19 was a pandemic, governments and private businesses - at the recommendation of public health officials - began enacting precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions and social distancing measures in many regions of the United States and Canada where we operate. Many enterprises instituted and maintained work from home programs and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for our platform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. 
Relative to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen a significant improvement in demand and in the health of our marketplace. The extent to which our operations will continue to be impacted by the pandemic and related changes in work, travel and lifestyle trends will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge. 
For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II.
Our Transportation Network
Our transportation network is comprised of:
•Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. In 2022, we launched Lyft Maps in an effort to optimize routing, improve safety, save riders and drivers time and add to our marketplace efficiency. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare offerings which include Wait & Save, Lux, Lux Black, Lux Black XL, and have access to Lyft Pink, Lyft’s transportation-focused membership.
•Express Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. 
•Lyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer a rental car option for users who have long-distance trips. Lyft Rentals is consumer facing and is therefore different from Express Drive, which is driver facing. Lyft Rentals is supported entirely by third-party partnerships. 
•Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are more active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit. 
•Public Transit. Available in select cities, our Transit offering integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is another step toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network. 
•Lyft Autonomous. Our partnership with Motional has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the safety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. 
Drivers
The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what matters most. Key benefits to drivers on our platform include:
•Flexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.
•Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis. 
•Transparent and Consistent Pay: We've released multiple features over the years aimed at providing transparency to drivers, including upfront pay, which enables drivers to see ride information and what they’ll earn before accepting a ride, and Weekly Pay Statement, which gives drivers a more clear and comprehensive view of earnings details. 
•Insurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while on the platform. 
•Community Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App. 
•Support. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.
Riders
Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile, or have used services for car owners available in the Lyft App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Key benefits to riders on our platform include:
•Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer riders more options for shorter trips. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to the trip being planned.
•Availability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. 
•Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time.
•Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policies and processes.
Business
Lyft is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people’s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education and government. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows clients to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and satisfaction while reducing cost and streamlining operations. 
Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic. We seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.
We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this agreement.
We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full backups are performed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.
Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform
Our robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities to predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the 
marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-related technology, micro-mobility, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. We hold numerous issued and pending patents in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we seek to register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Our Growth Strategy
Transportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:
•Increase Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and university ride smart programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizations to manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.
•Grow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to grow our rider base. We may make incremental investments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We strive to provide a full range of price points and ride experiences such as Wait & Save, which allows riders to save money by waiting for a ride, and Priority Pickup, which provides a premium experience by allowing riders to pay for prioritized pickup. We plan to continue to grow our ridesharing marketplace by prioritizing competitive service levels and attracting and retaining more drivers and riders on our network. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing percentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.
•Grow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network spans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.
•Deliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to a variety of economic opportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We also provide drivers with a suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources they need before taking the road. By making the driver experience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network. 
•Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers and riders. Our mapping technology, now known as Lyft Maps, optimizes routing, in-app navigation, and user matching to improve the rider and driver experience and our marketplace efficiency. Additional investments in our payments and data science capabilities have been central to making our network more efficient and seamless to use.
•Thoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. We have from time to time made strategic acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Bikeshare Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform in the United States at the time, Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners, and PBSC, a global leader in bikeshare that supplies stations and bikes to markets internationally. We will continue to selectively consider acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities to our network. In addition, we continue to expand our commercial partnerships. We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We have also built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursue partnerships that contribute to our growth.
Competition
The market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of supply and demand and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. Our main competitors in the vehicle rental market include Enterprise and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets outside of the United States.
Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS offerings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.
We believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Seasonality
The revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. Demand for our transportation network has historically declined over the winter season and demand for our network of Light Vehicles has historically increased during more temperate and dry seasons. 
Our Brand and Marketing
We believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketing efforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and social media engagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider and driver communities.
Our marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers and riders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, and outdoor advertisements. We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships, display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with current riders through a variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.
Our Commitment to Safety
A strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety. 
To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerly known as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. This dedication led our customer support to be recently named number one in Newsweek’s 2022 America’s Best Customer Service rankings for the E-mobility category. 
Some measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:
•Annual background checks and ongoing criminal monitoring. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered criminal background check before they drive and each year after that. In the United States, continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with disqualifying criminal convictions. Similarly, in the United States, we also continuously check driving records so that we can promptly identify and remove drivers from the platform upon detection of a disqualifying violation.
•Share location. The Lyft app provides real-time ride tracking, so riders can share their exact location and route with family and friends. Once a user enables this feature, a user’s trusted contacts (who they shared their location with) can see trip status and where they are on the map.
•Emergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with an ADT security professional, silently or by voice. If someone signals they need help and subsequently does not respond to a call or text from ADT, ADT will contact 911 and share the user’s location and other relevant information. 
•Smart trip check-in. We monitor rides, and in some instances, if we notice a ride irregularity, we reach out to riders and drivers directly. We will ask the rider or driver if they need help, and, if appropriate, connect them to emergency assistance or our own Safety team.
•Hidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While riders and drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not able to see a rider’s drop-off location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.
•Two-way ratings and feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or driver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never be matched with that individual again through the app. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.
The TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program”) to mandate that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms. Policymakers recently passed analogous legislation in Massachusetts and are considering similar rules in Oregon and New York City. 
See the section titled “Risk Factors,” including the subsection titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Human Capital
Our employees are our human capital and, together with our technology stack, are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. In early 2022, we implemented our flexible workplace strategy. A majority of employees were offered flexibility to work from an office location, home, or a hybrid combination that empowers them to do their best work. As of December 31, 2022, we had 4,419 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and internationally in Montreal, Canada, Munich, Germany and Minsk, Belarus. Approximately 41% of our employees work in our product management, engineering, design and science organizations. 
We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2022, our employee base was 58% male and 40% female, and women represented 40% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black, and 6% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable disclosure. As of December 31, 2022, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 1% of total U.S. employees. 
We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early candidate pipeline development as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization. In 2021, we set forth a road map and strategy to establish, launch and pilot new tools, partnerships, and outreach programs and in 2022, we implemented our roadmap strategy and held partnership events with BreakLine, Tribaja, and Disability:IN. We increased representation through our sourcing tool, hireEZ, and held disability and inclusion training for team members with the Inclusively and Direct Employers organizations.
We also include additional team member information in our 2022 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
In October 2022, we released our 2022 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report. We began publishing this report in 2020 and intend to continue to prepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.
Environmental
A world built around people, not cars. This is one of Lyft’s most powerful ideas: cities defined by public spaces that bring us together, not pavement and parking spots. Creating the transportation system that enables this is a big and long-term challenge — and it’s the one we wake up excited to work on every day. Our team operates with an authentic mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation. This mission shows up in a hundred different ways in the cities and communities we serve: in the ways we bring people together socially, offer economic independence, and take care of our planet. We work to meet each of these moments with integrity, humanity, and hospitality.
By making bikes and scooters easily available on our multimodal platform, and scaling ebikes as part of our shared fleets, we have empowered riders with affordable, convenient, and more sustainable ways to get around without cars. Today, we operate over 90,000 bikes and scooters across 10 markets in partnership with city governments and with our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions in 2022, have an additional 100,000+ bikes deployed in bikeshare systems in 46 markets in 15 countries.
Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. This is in line with the Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program which was approved by the California Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by 2030 and recently announced goals in New York City to get to 100% of rideshare miles in EVs by 2030. 
In 2021, Lyft continued to forge its path to 100% EVs by focusing on expanding on the Express Drive rental vehicle partner platform, advancing pilot programs to improve access to EVs and EV charging infrastructure, and advocating for public policies that will accelerate EV adoption. Additionally, in December 2022, Lyft announced a suite of offerings and partnerships to help drivers switch to EVs. The new offerings include a weekly earnings incentive for EV drivers, cashback on public EV charging, EV fast-charging discounts, and a Lyft-specific discount on home charging hardware and installation. We have also transitioned half of our driver rental rides to hybrid vehicles.
Social
Riders of all incomes and identities— including those who have been historically underserved—rely on the Lyft platform when they need a ride.
We approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust, respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. 
Through our LyftUp initiative, we aim to bridge the most serious transportation gaps across the U.S. by partnering with nonprofit organizations and governments to provide access to free and discounted transportation to individuals and families in need. In 2022, we estimate that we provided access to over 4.6 million discounted or donated car, bike and scooter rides to help under-resourced communities access key resources. Current LyftUp programs include:
•Jobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job to give unemployed and underemployed individuals a fairer chance at success;
•Grocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for individuals living in food-insecure areas to help ensure that transportation is not a barrier to healthy food;
•Vaccine Access - provides rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for at-risk communities; 
•Voting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such as seniors, veterans and communities of color.
•Disaster Response - provides rides to support communities in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters.
•Bikeshare Access - provides discounted bikeshare memberships and heavily discounted electric bike rides to income eligible riders across all Lyft-operated bikeshare systems.
Since 2017, our riders have been making their rides count for their community by rounding up their ride payments and donating the difference to an organization of their choice. To date, riders have donated more than $30 million to support nonprofits and communities across the U.S. and Canada.
Corporate Governance
Our board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating with the utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Corporate Information
