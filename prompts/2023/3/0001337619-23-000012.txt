Item 1. Business

Our mission is to empower financial advisors and service providers with innovative technology, solutions and intelligence. Envestnet has been a leader in helping transform wealth management, working towards its goal of expanding a holistic financial wellness ecosystem so that our clients can deliver an intelligent financial life to their clients ("Intelligent Financial Life").

Envestnet, a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1999, serves clients from its headquarters based in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, as well as other locations throughout the United States, India and other international locations. 
Segments
Envestnet is organized around two primary, complementary business segments. Financial information about each business segment is contained in Part II, Item 8, “Note 19—Segment Information”. Our business segments are as follows:
•Envestnet Wealth Solutions – a leading provider of unified wealth management software and services to empower financial advisors and institutions to enable them to deliver an Intelligent Financial Life to their clients.
•Envestnet Data & Analytics – a leading data aggregation, intelligence, and experiences platform that powers data connectivity and business intelligence across digital financial services to enable them to deliver an Intelligent Financial Life to their clients.
Envestnet Wealth Solutions Segment
Envestnet Wealth Solutions empowers financial advisors at broker-dealers, banks and RIAs with all the tools they require to deliver holistic wealth management to their end clients, enabling them to deliver an Intelligent Financial Life to their clients. In addition, the firm provides advisors with practice management support so that they can grow their practices and operate more efficiently. At the end of 2022, Envestnet Wealth Solutions’ platform assets are approximately $5.1 trillion in more than 18.3 million accounts overseen by approximately 106,000 advisors.
Services provided to advisors include: financial planning, risk assessment tools, investment strategies and solutions, asset allocation models, research, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork preparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services covering asset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing, aggregated multi‑custodian performance reporting and communication tools, plus data analytics. We have access to a wide range of leading third‑party asset custodians.
We offer these solutions principally through the following product and service suites:
•Envestnet | Enterprise provides an end-to-end open architecture wealth management platform, through which advisors can construct portfolios for clients. It begins with aggregated household data which then leads to the creation of a financial plan, asset allocation, investment strategy, portfolio management, rebalancing and performance reporting. Advisors have access to nearly 23,000 investment products. Envestnet | Enterprise also sells data aggregation and reporting, data analytics and digital advice capabilities to customers.

•Envestnet | MoneyGuide provides leading goals-based financial planning solutions to the financial services industry. The highly adaptable software helps financial advisors add significant value for their clients using best-in-class technology with enhanced integrations to generate financial plans.
•Envestnet | Retirement Solutions (“ERS & 401kplans.com”) offers a comprehensive suite of services for advisor-sold retirement plans. Our retirement solutions address the regulatory, data, and investment needs of retirement plans and delivers the information holistically. 401kplans.com is a digital 401(k) retirement plan marketplace that streamlines retirement plan distribution and due diligence among financial advisors and third-party administrators.

As the tables below indicate, Envestnet Wealth Solutions has experienced steady and significant growth over the last several years. We believe this growth is attributable to secular trends in the wealth management industry, the uniqueness and comprehensiveness of our products, as well as acquisitions. Periodically clients choose to change the way they pay for our solution, whereby they switch from an asset-based pricing model to a subscription-based model.
The following charts show growth in assets, number of accounts and advisors supported by Envestnet Wealth Solutions, distinguishing those metrics between assets under management or administration (“AUM/A”) and subscription.

Envestnet Data & Analytics Segment
Envestnet Data & Analytics is a leading data aggregation, data intelligence, and experiences platform. Envestnet Data & Analytics enables consumers to aggregate financial accounts within client applications and provides to clients the functionality to gather, refine, and aggregate massive sets of consumer permissioned data for use in financial applications, reports, market research analysis, and application programming interfaces (“APIs”).
Over 1,800 clients, including financial institutions, financial technology innovators and financial advisory firms, including 13 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, subscribe to the Envestnet Data & Analytics platform to underpin personalized financial apps and services for approximately 37 million paid end-users.
Envestnet Data & Analytics serves four main client groups: financial institutions (“Banking”), financial advisors and institutions (“Wealth”), market intelligence and analytics providers (“Research”) and financial technology innovators (“Tech”).
These groups serve the following customers:
•Banking – Retail Banks, Credit Unions and credit card providers
•Wealth – Wealth management financial advisors and institutions
•Research – Research and analyst firms
•Tech – Personal financial management, small business accounting, e-commerce, payment solutions providers, small business lending and authentication
With the exception of the Tech Group, we provide clients with secure access to open APIs, user facing applications powered by our platform, APIs and reports. We aggregate and cleanse client permission consumer data elements. Envestnet Data & Analytics also enables clients to develop their own applications through its open APIs, which deliver secure data, payments solutions, and other functionality.
The Tech group enables clients to develop new applications and enhance existing solutions through our APIs. These clients operate in a number of sub-vertical markets, including FinTech, wealth management, personal financial management, small business accounting, small business lending and authentication.
We believe that our brand recognition, innovative technology and intellectual property, large client base, and unique data gathering and enrichment provide us with competitive advantages that have enabled us to grow.
Market Opportunity
The wealth management industry has experienced significant growth in terms of assets invested by retail investors in the past several years. According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household financial assets totaled approximately $108 trillion as of September 30, 2022, representing a sizeable wealth management opportunity. According to Boston Consulting Group's Global Wealth Report 2022, total net wealth in North America is expected to grow by 4.9% annually between 2021 and 2026 to exceed $200 trillion. Based on data from Cerulli Associates, invested assets comprised an estimated 55% of overall U.S. household financial assets in 2021, advisor-directed assets totaled $30.7 trillion in 2021, and advisors had discretion over 58% of managed account assets as of September 30, 2022.
In the next 5-10 years, we believe the wealth management industry will continue to consolidate with fewer firms and fewer advisors managing more assets, making scale and operational efficiency increasingly important. This will require firms to integrate technology into all areas of their business.
The following trends are impacting our business and creating a large and growing market opportunity for data, technology, and investment solutions and services like ours:
•Scale: Scale is a defining theme across the financial services landscape, including wealth management. For example, in the independent broker-dealer channel, the ten largest firms are now 3.5 times larger than the next 40 firms, as measured by assets. In the RIA channel, firms with at least $1 billion of assets represented 75% of assets in 2021. We expect consolidation of firms and assets to continue, driven by factors including advisor succession needs, private capital attracted to the space, and the growing expectations of end-investors for modern digital experiences and holistic advice relationships. We are well positioned for this future. More specific, as of December 31, 2022, the company served approximately 106,000 financial advisors, including those at 47 of the top 50 wealth management and brokerage firms and over 500 RIAs. Envestnet | MoneyGuide is the leading financial planning software provider, according to a 2022 T3/Inside Information Survey; more than 2.5 million plans were created or updated in 2022. Envestnet Data & Analytics has over 400 million linked accounts and approximately 37 million paid end-users. From an operations standpoint, we handled over 200 million trades in 2022 and over 10 million service requests across more than 30 trading and custody partners.
•Personalization: Consumers are increasingly demanding personalization in both their technology and their investments. On the technology front, Envestnet Data & Analytics is delivering over 20 million insights per day to financial advisors, home offices, and financial institutions. By surfacing actionable opportunities, we are enabling our customers to create a better client experience and drive business efficiency and growth. Also, in 2022, we introduced a new, modern, highly configurable client portal with features such as account aggregation, a spending and budgeting experience, an Envestnet | MoneyGuide goal-planning page, and various widgets and performance reports. On the investment side, direct indexing, tax overlay, and sustainable investing enable advisors to tailor portfolios to meet specific client needs. We have invested in each of these capabilities for years and continue to enhance our offerings. For instance, in late 2021, our direct indexing solution received GIPS verification and it currently has a 9-year, GIPS-compliant track record. In 2022, our overlay services team introduced an after-tax reporting capability.
•Integrated technology: Financial advisors and enterprises are looking for integrated, seamless WealthTech workflows; as such, spending on technology continues to climb. According to the 2022 InvestmentNews Advisor Technology Study, the median wealth management firm spent 3.7% of revenue on technology in 2021, up from 3.2% in 2016. We are delivering a cloud-based, open architecture, end-to-end technology stack to the marketplace. Our offering is broad and integrated, encompassing portfolio management capabilities from proposal to planning to reporting and billing. We have also invested in and connected its core technology offerings to the Envestnet Insurance Exchange, the Envestnet Credit Exchange, and the Envestnet Trust Exchange, among other offerings, to create a comprehensive digital ecosystem for advisors and their clients. During 2021, we opened up our UMA technology to Envestnet | Tamarac users, which should benefit from and drive growing adoption of managed accounts among RIAs. In 2022, we introduced the next generation proposal tool, which provides enhanced features, streamlined workflows, and seamless access to managed accounts. We plan to continue to invest in software, APIs, developer tools, and integration points.
•Leveraging data: Enterprises, advisors, and financial institutions need to leverage in-house and third-party data to make better, more timely decisions. According to NewVantage Partners’ Data and AI Leadership Executive Survey 2022, 92% of senior executives respondents stated their organizations were increasing investments in data and artificial intelligence. As part of our Wealth Data Platform, we gather and ingest advisor client accounts, classifying them using a uniform process across account types and sources. Data comes from our portfolio accounting system, a client-permissioned source via account aggregation, or an account assigned to a firm within an institutional feed from a custodian, recordkeeper, trust accounting system, or data provider. All accounts are fully reconciled and packaged at the enterprise level. These offerings and related tools provide our customers with a single source of truth for wealth data. Further, our ecosystem brings together a diverse group of constituents—consumers, product manufacturers, technology providers, developers and advisors—to create a network where consumer-permissioned data can be leveraged to optimize experiences.
•Independent and fee-based advice: We are a driver and beneficiary of the growth of financial advice, movement to independent channels, fee-based pricing, and managed accounts. Beginning with financial advice industry growth, in an annual survey by MarketCast and Cerulli Associates, 60% of affluent investors stated they are willing to pay for advice in 2022, up from 58% in 2017. Cerulli forecasts independent advice channels to expand from 39% of advisor-mediated assets in 2021 to 45% in 2026, driven by growth in the RIA and hybrid RIA channels. Advice delivered with fee-based pricing—as opposed to commission-based pricing—also continues to take share, growing from 43% of industry assets in 2016 to 54% in 2021, according to Cerulli. Lastly, using data from Cerulli Lodestar, managed account assets have grown organically (excluding market appreciation) at a 10% annualized rate from December 31, 2016 through September 30, 2022. Our managed account annualized organic asset growth rate, as measured by organic AUM growth, has been approximately double that of the industry over the same time period.
Business Model
Our business model lends itself to a high degree of recurring and predictable revenues. We provide asset-based, subscription-based and professional services on a business-to-business-to-consumer basis to financial services clients, whereby customers offer solutions based on our platform to their end users. On a business-to-business basis, we deliver an open platform to customers and third-party developers through an open API framework. We believe that a number of characteristics contribute to the success of our business model, including:
•Favorable trends with respect to growth in fee-based assets and need for advanced technology; 
•Recurring and resilient revenue base; and
•Strong customer retention.
Our revenues are generated in the following manners:
Asset-based Recurring Revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to platform services through the Company’s uniquely customized platforms. These platform services include investment manager research, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio performance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing and back office and middle-office operations and administration and are made available to customers throughout the contractual term from the date the customized platform is launched. 
The asset-based fees the Company earns are generally based upon variable percentages of assets managed or administered on our platforms. The fee percentage varies based on the level and type of services the Company provides to its customers, as well as the values of existing customer accounts. The values of the customer accounts are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.
For approximately 80% of our asset‑based fee arrangements, customers are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our wealth management platforms as of the end of the prior quarter, providing for a high degree of revenue visibility in the current quarter. Revenue may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on changes in asset values, fee rates on those asset values and asset flows.
Subscription-based Recurring Revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to the Company’s technology platforms for wealth management and financial wellness. The subscription-based fees generally include fixed fees and or usage-based fees.
Subscription fees vary based on the scope of technology solutions and services being used, and are priced in a variety of constructs based on the size of the business, number of users or number of accounts, and in many cases can increase over time based on the growth of these factors.
Despite this potential variance, we believe that our subscription fees are also highly predictable because they are generally established in multi‑year contracts providing longer‑term visibility regarding that portion of total revenues.
Professional Services and Other
We also generate revenue from professional services for client onboarding, technology development and other project related work.
 Growth Strategy
We intend to increase revenue and profitability by pursuing the following strategies:
•Capture addressable market:
◦Enterprise clients in wealth management. We provide enterprise clients with customized, private‑labeled technology platforms that enable them to support their affiliated financial advisors with a broad range of investment solutions and services. 
◦Financial advisors that are working alone or as part of financial advisory firms. Our principal value proposition aimed at financial advisors working alone or as part of financial advisory firms is that our technology platforms allow them to compete effectively with financial advisors employed by large financial institutions. 
◦Financial institutions. We serve global banks through financial applications. Envestnet Data & Analytics Retail Banking solution is a set of innovative FinApps providing consumers with a clear picture and greater insight into their financial lives. It enables customers to consolidate all their financial account information in one place which allows customers to manage and meet their financial goals, which in turn leads to increased engagement.
◦Other financial technology providers. We work with a variety of firms who provide technology to the financial services industry. We provide FinApps, personal financial management tools and data aggregation capabilities to companies in online lending, e-commerce and payments, digital advice and wealth management and other web development firms.
•Modernize the digital engagement marketplace:
◦We have made significant investments in platform development in order to enhance and expand our technology platforms and expect these investments to continue in the future.
◦We expect to continue focusing our technology development efforts principally on adding features to increase our market competitiveness, enhancements to improve operating efficiency, address regulatory demands and reduce risk and client‑driven requests for new capabilities. 
•Open the platform:
◦As we connect with more firms and developers, our product offerings continue to expand and vitalize our environment, which we believe drives more benefit for our customers. 
We also continue to pursue strategic transactions and other relationships to support our growth strategies.
Technology Platforms
We are composed of technology platforms that are primarily multi-tenant SAAS-based hybrid cloud offerings that afford us the flexibility to offer a highly scalable consolidated workflow via a web-based user interface that is complemented by an API led open strategy that enables us to offer an integrated omnichannel flexibility and collaboration ecosystem. This open ecosystem strategy has enabled us to abstract, integrate and modernize our offerings at a rapid pace while also enabling our customers and partners to add incremental value on top of our platform via a fit for a purpose managed open ecosystem model.
We are committed to our operational and information security capabilities as strategic differentiators. We undergo annual SSAE 16 SOC 2 Type II audits to validate the continued operation of our internal controls for our flagship offerings within the ecosystem; the Unified Managed Platform, Envestnet Data & Analytics Platform and Envestnet | Tamarac platforms. The SOC reports confirm design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. We maintain multiple redundancies, back up our databases and safeguard technologies and proprietary information consistent with industry best practices. We also maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and company‑wide risk assessment program that is consistent with industry best practices and that complies with applicable regulatory requirements.
Our proprietary ecosystem provides Enterprise clients in wealth management, financial advisors that are working alone or as part of financial advisory firms, financial institutions, and FinTech firms along with their respective customers, access to investment solutions and services, enriched financial data, analytics, and workflows that enable the foundational orchestration of an Intelligent Financial Life via one unified experience, with the widest range of front‑, middle‑ and back‑office needs. The “open architecture” design of our ecosystem and platforms provide our customers and their customers with flexibility in terms of the investment solutions, services they access, data they leverage, and configurability to meet their unique needs. The multi‑tenant platform architecture ensures that this level of flexibility and customization is achieved without requiring us to create unique applications for each client, thereby enabling improved efficacy and efficiency vs other offerings. In addition, though our technology platforms are designed to deliver a breadth of functions, our customers can select from the various investment solutions, services, data, and analytics we offer; without being required to subscribe to or purchase more than what they believe is necessary.
An integral part of our strategy is an open architecture approach to integration via our OpenENV integration platform. This strategy allows for robust integrations with 3rd party technology platforms and service providers and enables client firms to create unique client and advisor experiences powered by the Envestnet ecosystem.
Our data aggregation platform collects a wide variety of end user-permissioned transaction-level data from approximately 17,000 sources, including banking, investment, loan and credit card information, and puts this data in a common repository. Envestnet Data & Analytics has developed robust proprietary technology and processes and established relationships that allows us to curate these data sources and expand our access to new data sources. Over 75% of this data is collected through structured feeds from our customers. These structured feeds, which consist of either batch files pushed to us or real-time access, provide this critical data efficiently and at scale. Where we do not have direct connections, we capture data using our proprietary information-gathering techniques.
Beyond collecting data, our data aggregation platform performs a data refining process and augments the data with additional information from a variety of other sources. We enrich the data with a proprietary process, adding such elements as categorization and merchant identification for bank or credit card account data and security identification, classification and normalization for investment data. As our ecosystem usage grows and is exposed to more users, use cases and related data, the system benefits from machine learning algorithms to better normalize, categorize and process large amounts of data, allowing our network to become more effective, efficient and valuable to our customers. Utilizing this enhanced data, including consolidated data from within our customers, our data intelligence organizes, analyzes and presents it in a manner that helps our customers offer personalized solutions that enable their consumers to achieve better financial outcomes.
Our analytics platform provides a highly scalable cloud-based environment that supports a cost effective and secure way of handling very large data sets, permitting us to develop and test new machine learning algorithms and transform these data sets using the resulting models. The results of the computations can be accessed interactively, as insights, suggestions, or next best actions within our workflow offerings, as files, or via API access for use in third-party or proprietary customer applications and environments to create competitive advantage for our customers and their customers.
In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred technology development costs for all our technology platforms totaling approximately $112 million, $80 million and $72 million, respectively. Of these costs, we capitalized approximately $89 million, $65 million and $55 million, respectively, as internally developed software.
Sales and Marketing 
We are putting forth an extensive effort in partnering sales and marketing to deliver a cohesive and holistic message to the wealth management industry. Efforts to increase the use of technology and sales enablement tools allows for more predictive and effective conversations with our advisor client-base as well as prospective customers.
•Our advisor-facing sales teams are both field sales and internal consultants. Depending on the specific business unit, they are organized regionally or by firm segmentation. They help advisors understand and access our investment solutions, create investment proposals, navigate our wealth management platform and facilitate new business. As an example, our Platform Consulting Group and Business Development Directors help advisors utilize our wealth management platform effectively and efficiently. They are subject matter experts on advisor managed programs, unified managed accounts (“UMA”), proposal guidance and site navigation. They provide consulting services to a number of large clients. Our PMC Consulting team of investment professionals provide a variety of portfolio and investment management consulting services to advisors using our wealth management platform. 
•Enterprise Consultants are the main point of contact for enterprise clients with respect to day-to-day platform matters as well as contractual and pricing efforts. This includes support for advisors and firm management with regard to the overall relationship. The enterprise consultant is essentially the client’s relationship manager who serves as the liaison between the firm and Envestnet.
•We have a direct sales and pre-sales team servicing the leading global financial institutions. The sales team is divided geographically. Each regional sales and pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new customers. Within the North America region, direct sales and pre-sales representatives are further divided into teams that focus on specific accounts, on a named-account basis, depending on size, location, product specialization and/or brand. Our current customers work most closely with our Client Partner teams who specialize in customer account management and expansion. Together, sales, pre-sales and Client Partners are responsible for growing our customer relationships in terms of establishing new customers, deepening our relationships with existing customers (cross-selling additional products and services into the same or additional groups) and expanding use of existing products and services (increasing usage).
•We have a direct sales and technical pre-sales team covering financial technology providers in each region. Each regional sales and technical pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new customers and channel partners. From time to time, we assign specific accounts based upon sales or domain expertise. These teams are supported by a customer success and developer relations team who specialize in customer API integration, and account management and expansion, including services to our channel partners. Together, sales, technical pre-sales, customer success and developer relations representatives are responsible for growing our direct customer and channel partner relationships in terms of account penetration and API usage.
Our marketing efforts are focused on initiatives to drive global brand and ecosystem awareness and significant demand generation and sales acceleration across our whole business. Our marketing strategy uses data driven integrated efforts across paid, earned and owned media in order to reach our targeted clients and prospects with the right message at the right time.
To support and expand our current addressable market, our goal is to educate the market and our clients about our solutions and achieve recognition as the industry leader. We drive ongoing communication through thought leadership content, media interviews speaking engagements and industry analyst relations. We also employ a variety of integrated sales and marketing initiatives, including hosting demand generated webinars, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences, as well as executing our own events.
Additionally, as practice management and support is important to our advisors' business, we partner on direct email campaigns, conduct proprietary research and produce collateral for financial advisors to use with their clients.
Our digital marketing efforts are increasing and are designed to support our clients and to engage audiences in actual and measurable ways. We use digital media for search optimization, account base marketing and to drive traffic to our digital solutions and websites. Our integrated creative campaigns consist of online performance advertising, social media, podcasts and digital content marketing. 
During 2022, we further enhanced our use of digital, and continued virtual events as a response to limitations of in person contacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and remote work changes.
Competition
Our competitors offer a variety of products and services that compete with one or more of the investment solutions and services provided through our ecosystem of technology platforms; although, based on our industry experience, we believe that none offers a more comprehensive set of products and services than we do.
Within Envestnet Wealth Solutions, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:
•The breadth and quality of investment solutions and services to which we provide access through our technology platform;
•The number of custodians that are connected through our technology platforms;
•The price of our investment solutions and services;
•The ease of use of our technology platforms; and
•The nature and scope of investment solutions and services that each wealth management provider believes are necessary to address their needs.
Our Envestnet Data & Analytics group competes with other financial technology companies, credit bureaus and data, analytics and digital providers. Based on our global and multi-industry experience, we do not believe any other single company in the data aggregation, analytics and digital experiences space offers a diverse, comprehensive set of platforms with features such as ours.
Within Envestnet Data & Analytics, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:
•Reputation;
•Global and multi-market and segments reach;
•Cloud-based delivery model;
•Data aggregation capability;
•Access to data through direct structured data feeds;
•Scale (size of customer base and level of user adoption);
•Security and open banking infrastructure;
•Time to market;
•Unique analytics capability;
•Breadth and depth of application functionality user experience;
•Access and integration to/with third-party applications;
•Ease of use, ease of integration, flexibility and configurability; and
•Competitive pricing.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
Regulation
The financial services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory and mutual fund advisory businesses, each of which is subject to a specific regulatory scheme, including regulation at the federal and state level, as well as regulation by self-regulatory organizations and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations of general application.
Our subsidiaries Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. (“EAM”), Envestnet Portfolio Solutions, Inc. (“EPS”), FDX Advisors, Inc., QRG Capital Management, Inc. (“QRG”), Envestnet Embedded Advisory, Inc., and Envestnet Retirement Solutions, LLC operate investment advisory businesses. These subsidiaries are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as “investment advisers” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and are regulated thereunder. They may also provide fiduciary services as defined in Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), including acting as an “investment manager” (as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA). As described further below, many of our investment advisory programs are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an “investment company” provided for under Rule 3a-4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). EAM serves as the investment adviser to two mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as “investment companies” under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act, Investment Company Act and ERISA, together with related regulations and interpretations of the SEC and the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including recordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities and the requirement that conflicts of interest be monitored, mitigated, and disclosed. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the investment products and advice they provide, seek “best execution” for their clients’ securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party products offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser’s fees and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Advisers Act, ERISA and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder.
Envestnet Data & Analytics is examined on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies. For example, Envestnet Data & Analytics is a supervised third-party technology service provider subject to multi-agency supervisory examinations in a wide variety of areas based on published guidance by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. These examinations include reviews of Envestnet Data & Analytics’ management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT and disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) is the agency in charge of these examinations.
Either as a result of direct regulation or obligations under customer agreements, our subsidiaries are required to comply with certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, related to the privacy of consumer information and may be subject to other privacy and data security laws because of the solutions we provide. In addition, numerous regulations continue to be proposed and promulgated that necessitate the implementation of additional controls of companies like ours.
Many of the laws and regulations to which our subsidiaries are subject are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. We continually develop improvements to our existing products and services as well as new products and services. 
Investment Advisory Program Conducted Under Rule 3a-4
Under the Investment Company Act, an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed an “investment company,” in which case the issuer may be subject to registration requirements and regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In order to provide assurance that certain discretionary investment advisory programs would not be considered investment companies, the SEC adopted Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act, which provides a non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an investment company for programs that meet the requirements of the rule. We conduct and support the following programs pursuant to the Rule 3a-4 safe harbor:
•Separately managed accounts;
•Unified managed account portfolios;
•Mutual fund portfolios and exchange-traded fund portfolios; and
•Advisor as portfolio manager.

COLLABORATION is critical to Envestnet’s ability to stay ahead of the demands of our ever-changing industry. Together, through a culture of generosity, open communication and sharing, we can uphold our mission and shape our industry.
ACCOUNTABILITY is intrinsic to maintaining our clients’ trust, our colleagues’ confidence and our own integrity. At Envestnet we aim for transparency and responsibility in all that we do. By standing behind our work, we can build a stronger business and more lasting client relationships. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)
We recognize that our workforce is made up of people of different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs. We welcome and encourage this diversity and inclusion. Respecting each person as an individual and welcoming the richness of ideas that come from such diversity help us meet our objective of being a great place to work.
We value the creative ideas and broader perspective that comes with a diverse workforce. We seek the best talent from the widest possible pool, and we continue to offer opportunities for people willing and able to perform in a challenging and competitive environment. We value employee diversity, equity and inclusion, and are committed to providing our employees with the resources and support they need to achieve their full potential. 
DEI - Professional Development
In June 2022 we launched mandatory DEI training which provided a safe space for employees to explore their varied experiences and perspectives. The Foundations of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is an interactive training that addresses a wide spectrum of topics, increasing awareness of how we engage across our differences. Over 1,500 employees completed this training, including our CEO and his direct reports. This mandatory training will continue as a requirement in 2023. 
Also in 2022, we also introduced a “Share Your Pronouns” campaign that was accompanied by training that focused on why sharing pronouns at work is important. Additional sessions had to be added given its popularity. Over 900 employees completed this training.
Since 2021, we have partnered with the University of Delaware Women’s Leadership program to provide women tools and resources to succeed in their leadership journey. Approximately 40 women have participated to date and graduates of the program have created an alumni group to continue their learning journey and help encourage and develop other women.
DEI - Talent Acquisition
In 2022, all members of our Talent Acquisition team completed their certifications as Diversity and Inclusion Recruiters. The program offers talent acquisition professionals the opportunity to learn strategies to create or improve their diversity and inclusion recruiting practices. Topics include building a strategy to locate under-represented candidates, using online data resources that support inclusive hiring, and analyzing opportunities for improving job descriptions to reach a more inclusive candidate pool. 
Also in 2022, we began utilizing a national job board service which provides us with access to target diverse groups through a network of 15,500 community-based organizations and niche diversity sites. This increases our applications and helps us to access to an expansive talent pool of underrepresented groups.
DEI - Employee Resource Groups
The recognition of Juneteenth at Envestnet included the introduction of our third official employee resource group. The resource group, “Enclusion,” was created by African American and Black-American employees to celebrate our differences in background, ethnicity, and perspectives. This group will champion initiatives that elevate voices, networking, and professional development for all employees.
The resource group “Bridges” continues to encourage all employees to participate in conversations regarding diversity and differences, building greater understanding and enhancing our Envestnet community. 
Our Women’s Initiative Network (“WIN”) continues to provide women with the tools, training, and networking connections to advance in their careers and build a platform for them to succeed. In 2022, WIN hosted a Women in Wealth Forum at the Advisor Summit with over 200 participants.
We continue to be an ambassador for Money Management Institute, an organization with a mission to prepare under-represented talent for the financial tech industry.
In 2022, we were recognized by ThinkAdvisor for our efforts in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion with a Luminary Award.
Workforce Demographics
In 2022, our employee population primarily remains based in the United States and India, 57% and 42%, respectively, with less than 1% of employees in Australia and Great Britain. Our global workforce decreased 16% from 4,335 full-time employees to 3,429 full-time employees in 2022. During the fourth quarter of this year, Envestnet entered into a partnership with Tata Consultancy Services, outsourcing 94% of our Yodlee Bangalore workforce, reducing our overall India population by 35%.
In 2021, we launched “People Manager Dashboards” which provide U.S.-based managers with anonymous information regarding the race/ethnicity and gender demographics of their teams, as well as information regarding open positions, promotions, terminations. This data helps managers pinpoint opportunities to increase diversity when hiring, promoting, and developing employees. No employee is represented in a collective bargaining agreement.
Learning & Development
Through our global learning management system, employees have access to over 19,000 learning courses, including management and skills development; and U.S. based employees receive reimbursement for training, certifications, and degrees. In 2022, there were approximately 80,000 training completions by employees in Cornerstone. Additionally, approximately 3,000 unique courses were completed. Major enhancements were also conducted which included improving our data feed process from Workday, updating our catalog, and developing processes to improve our user and client experience.
The Envestnet Scholarship Program has expanded its partnership with the CFP Board to offer scholarships to undergraduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the financial planning profession who are pursuing their Certified Financial Planner™ designation. Women and minorities who are undergraduates can apply for these scholarships. As of June 30, 2022, 74 scholarships totaling over $413,000 have been granted.
In 2022, we hosted a diverse group of approximately 60 interns in our Berwyn, Raleigh, Denver, and San Mateo offices, in addition to a small number of interns who participated remotely. Of our interns, 53% self-identified as Black, Asian, Hispanic or Two or More Races, and 39% as female or other. During the 10-week program, interns spent half their time working on team-specific related items, which included projects and assignments coming from their managers and departments, and the other half their time was spent on program-related items. Interns worked on a project presented to leadership at the end of the summer. Eligible 2022 interns were given an opportunity to apply for a full-time position post-graduation via our Rotational program. 
The Delegates Program is a nine-month professional development program for a diverse pool of high performing employees. Of these program participants, 40% self-identify as Black, Asian, Hispanic, or Two or More Races, and 46% as female. This program allows us to build a strong bench of future leaders by increasing the leadership skills and competencies of its participants. In 2022, 15 employees graduated from the program.
Engagement
We conduct global surveys every other year, and other surveys throughout the year. We also participate in “Best Places to Work in FinTech” which surveys up to 400 employees selected at random. We were rated 41st in 2021, which was our first year of participation. In 2022, we moved up to 29th.
The Best Places to Work survey takes into consideration Envestnet’s policies, practices, philosophy, systems, and demographics; Envestnet improved overall, including two areas of great importance:
•Envestnet leaders are open to input from employees
•Employees feel they can express their honest opinions without fear of negative consequences, and are valued by Envestnet
In our last Global Survey conducted at the end of 2021, we rated 4 points above the standard for employee satisfaction and received positive feedback in the areas of leadership, development, and inclusion from employees:
•84% of employees surveyed responded favorably to “I have confidence in the Leadership team.”
•82% of employees surveyed responded favorably to “I am excited about Envestnet’s future.”
•83% of employees surveyed responded favorably to “Envestnet takes a genuine interest in employees--
We have quarterly live all-hands meetings and survey employees following these meetings, encouraging employee feedback so that we can continually increase and improve our communication between leaders and employees.
In Our Community
The Envestnet Institute on Campus (“EIOC”) is a program for motivated university students designed to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and the application of this knowledge in the Wealth and Asset Management industries. Many of our employees have graduated from this key Learning and Development program. The curriculum is currently offered at 47 universities and colleges, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities such as Howard University. The program includes mentoring, job placement, and financial literacy initiatives. As of June 30, 2022, over 6,000 students have completed the program averaging an approximate 72% completion rate. More than 2,000 women and over 2,000 students of color have completed the program. EIOC continues to support job and internship placements through its résumé database, which contains 3,000 résumés for employers seeking workforce-ready employees for internships and entry-level positions
The Envestnet Cares program empowers our employees to engage in their local communities with paid time off for volunteer activities, charitable donation matching, and partnerships with several non-profit organizations. U.S. employees receive an annual match of up to $3,000, as well as increased match and limits for special match campaigns. We donated approximately $1.3 million and $1 million worldwide in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In 2022, our employees received three paid Volunteer Days for use when volunteering for a non-profit organization of their choice during the workweek, or as part of a Company-organized volunteering event. Despite canceling in person volunteer events early in 2022 due to the Pandemic, our employees still volunteered 371 days as employees participated in several virtual events such as writing notes to veterans and the elderly, making toys for dogs in shelters, and assembling skateboards for kids in the community.
Total Rewards
To attract and retain top talent in our highly competitive industry, we offer employees a comprehensive total rewards package. For U.S. based employees, this includes competitive base pay, annual bonus consideration, long-term incentive grants, employer-subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance, employer match for retirement savings, paid time off, group term life and disability insurance, college tuition reimbursement and scholarships, as well as paid parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, parental stipend for children under age 6 and military leave with pay differential. During 2021, we added adoption and surrogacy to further support our employees in balancing work and life as well as After Tax Retirement contributions, and in 2022, we added a student loan repayment benefit to help our employees improve their financial wellness by paying down their loan balances. All U.S. based, full-time employees also receive ten paid holidays, a minimum of three weeks paid time off, six sick/personal emergency days, three floating holidays, and three paid volunteer days per year. 
India-based employees receive standard health and welfare benefits, as well as additional family medical coverage, an internet stipend, and free transportation home from late shifts. We support our employees’ physical and mental health with a no-cost Wellness Program; and provide legal, financial, and work-life solutions with our Employee Assistance Program.
Pandemic Response
We care about our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace. Our continuing focus on the health and well-being of our colleagues has enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Pandemic Response Team, which includes our CEO and other senior members of management, meets as needed to assess the risks and status for each office location and to ensure business continuity.
All of our employees began working remotely in March 2020. Our Pandemic Response Team established protocols to ensure the safety of our employees while working remotely and upon return to our office locations. This included mandatory COVID-19 training, advanced cleaning protocols for all offices, modified workspaces, and communication that provides employees with regular updates regarding Envestnet’s response to the impact of the pandemic. Beginning in early 2022, employees were welcomed back to the office once their proof of vaccination was received. Later in 2022, we reopened our offices to full staffing, regardless of vaccine status.
During the pandemic, our employees also received additional benefits to support home-office set-up (U.S. and India), parental stipend (U.S.), additional health insurance (India), and utility stipend (India), as well as multiple initiatives and organized activities to support mental wellness, morale and team building.
