ITEM 1.BUSINESS
THE COMPANY
Overview 
PNMR is an investor-owned holding company with two regulated utilities serving approximately 815,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and end-users of electricity in New Mexico and Texas. PNMR’s electric utilities are PNM and TNMP. PNMR strives to create a clean and bright energy future for customers, communities, and shareholders. PNMR’s strategy and decision-making are focused on safely providing reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible power built on a foundation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles. 
PNMR is focused on achieving three key financial objectives:

•Earning authorized returns on regulated businesses
•Delivering at or above industry-average earnings and dividend growth
•Maintaining investment grade credit ratings
In conjunction with these objectives, PNM and TNMP are dedicated to:
•Maintaining strong employee safety, plant performance, and system reliability
•Delivering a superior customer experience
•Demonstrating environmental stewardship in business operations, including transitioning to an emissions-free generating portfolio by 2040
•Supporting the communities in their service territories
PNMR’s success in accomplishing its financial objectives is highly dependent on two key factors: fair and timely regulatory treatment for its utilities and the utilities’ strong operating performance. The Company has multiple strategies in place to achieve favorable regulatory treatment, all of which have as their foundation a focus on the basics: safety, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction, while engaging stakeholders to build productive relationships. The Company believes that maintaining strong and modern electric infrastructure is critical to ensuring reliability and supporting economic growth. PNM and TNMP strive to balance service affordability with infrastructure investment to maintain a high level of electric reliability and to deliver a safe and superior customer experience.
Both PNM and TNMP seek cost recovery for their investments through general rate cases, periodic cost of service filings, and various rate riders. Additional information about rate filings is provided in Operations and Regulation below and in Note 17.

OPERATIONS AND REGULATION
Regulated Operations
Electric power demand is generally seasonal. Power consumption in both New Mexico and Texas peaks during the hot summer months with revenues traditionally peaking during that period. The seasonality of demand for electricity in turn impacts the timing of plant maintenance and operating expense throughout the year. As a result, the quarterly operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries vary throughout the year. In addition, unusually mild or extreme weather patterns may cause the overall operating results of the Company to fluctuate.
PNM

Operational Information
PNM is an electric utility that provides electric generation, transmission, and distribution service to its rate-regulated customers. PNM was incorporated in the State of New Mexico in 1917. PNM’s retail electric service territory covers a large area of north-central New Mexico, including the cities of Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe, and certain areas of southern New Mexico. Service to retail electric customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the NMPRC. The largest retail electric customer served by PNM accounted for 3.6% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other services provided by PNM include wholesale transmission services to third parties. Regulation encompasses the utility’s electric rates, service, accounting, issuances of securities, construction of major new generation, abandonment of existing generation, types of generation resources, transmission and distribution facilities, and other matters. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information on rate cases and other regulatory matters. 
A - 2


Weather-normalized retail electric KWh sales increased by 1.5% in 2022 and by 0.3% in 2021. The system peak demands for retail customers are as follows:
System Peak Demands

 | 2022 | 2021 | | 2020
 | (Megawatts)
Summer | 2,139 | | 1,968 | | 1,974
Winter | 1,526 | | 1,518 | | 1,460

PNM holds long-term, non-exclusive franchise agreements for its electric retail operations, with varying expiration dates. These franchise agreements allow the utility to access public rights-of-way for placement of its electric facilities. Franchise agreements have expired in some areas PNM serves. Because PNM remains obligated under New Mexico state law to provide service to customers in these areas, the expirations should not have a material adverse impact. The Albuquerque and Rio Rancho metropolitan areas accounted for 31.7% and 5.5% of PNM’s 2022 revenues and no other franchise area represents more than 5%. PNM also earns revenues from its electric retail operations in its service areas that do not require franchise agreements.
PNM owns 3,428 miles of electric transmission lines that interconnect with other utilities in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, and Utah. New Mexico is frequently characterized by its high potential for solar and wind capacity. PNM owns transmission capacity in an area of eastern New Mexico with large wind generation potential and in recent years there has been substantial interest by developers of wind generation to interconnect to PNM’s transmission system in this area. In 2021, PNM invested approximately $285 million for the expansion of PNM’s transmission system reflecting the purchase of the Western Spirit Line to provide additional service to transmit power from these generation resources to customers in New Mexico and California. Services under related transmission agreements were initiated using an incremental rate in December 2021, which significantly increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2021. See Note 4. 
PNM began participating in the EIM on April 1, 2021 which has generated cost savings that are passed through to customers in PNM’s FPPAC. PNM also engages in activities to optimize its existing jurisdictional assets and long-term power agreements through spot market, hour-ahead, day-ahead, week-ahead, and other sales of excess generation not required to fulfill retail load and contractual commitments. These activities have significantly increased Electric operating revenues and are passed on to customers under PNM’s FPPAC with no impact to net earnings. PNM continues to evaluate opportunities that benefit customers and is exploring opportunities with the expectation of reliably achieving incrementally greater cost savings and using the region’s increasing renewable resources more efficiently. PNM supports efforts in the Western United States to expand regional market opportunities by participating in day-ahead market design initiatives and discussions on Regional Transmission Organization formation. As PNM transitions its system to achieve 100% carbon emission-free generation, PNM is faced with resource adequacy concerns in the summer peak periods to reliably service its customers. See Note 17 for further discussion on summer peak resource adequacy.
Regulatory Activities
NMPRC Regulated Retail Rate Proceedings
The rates PNM charges retail customers are subject to traditional rate regulation by the NMPRC. In December 2022, PNM filed the 2024 Rate Change with the NMPRC. The application proposes an increase of $63.8 million in base non-fuel revenues. The requested increase is based on a calendar year 2024 FTY and the request reflects an ROE of 10.25%. The requested change primarily reflects investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure, largely offset by cost reductions resulting from PNM’s transition to lower-cost, clean generation resources including the retirement of the SJGS and expiration of leased capacity from PVNGS. The request also includes updated depreciation rates for natural gas plants to align with the Company’s 2040 carbon-free portfolio goal. See Note 17.
In October 2022, PNM filed its Grid Modernization Application with the NMPRC. PNM’s proposal to modernize its electricity grid through infrastructure and technology improvements increases the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and security of PNM’s electric system. PNM's application seeks approval of grid modernization investments of approximately $344 million for the first six years of a broader 11-year strategy. See Note 17.
PNM has a NMPRC-approved rate rider to collect costs for renewable energy procurements that are not otherwise being collected in rates. If PNM’s earned return on jurisdictional equity in a calendar year, adjusted for weather and other items not representative of normal operation, exceeds the NMPRC-approved rate by 0.5%, the rider provides that PNM would refund the excess to customers during the following year. PNM slightly exceeded the limitation in 2022 but not in 2021. See Note 17. The NMPRC has also approved riders designed to allow PNM to bill and collect substantially all fuel and purchased power costs, costs of approved energy efficiency initiatives, and costs associated with enhancing transportation electrification in New Mexico.
A - 3


FERC Regulated Wholesale Transmission
Rates charged to wholesale electric transmission customers, other than customers on the Western Spirit Line described below, are based on a formula rate mechanism pursuant to which rates for wholesale transmission service are calculated annually in accordance with an approved formula. The formula includes updating cost of service components, including investment in plant and operating expenses, based on information contained in PNM’s annual financial report filed with FERC, as well as including projected transmission capital projects to be placed into service in the following year. The projections included are subject to true-up in the formula rate for the following year. Certain items, including changes to return on equity and depreciation rates, require a separate filing to be made with FERC before being included in the formula rate. In December 2021, PNM completed the purchase of the Western Spirit Line and service under related transmission agreements was initiated using an incremental rate that is separate from the formula rate mechanism described above.
The Energy Transition Act (“ETA”)
The ETA became effective on June 14, 2019. As discussed below, the ETA amends the REA and requires utilities operating in New Mexico to provide 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045. The ETA also provides for a transition from fossil-fueled generating resources to renewable and other carbon-free resources by allowing utilities to issue to qualified investors securitized bonds, or “energy transition bonds,” related to the retirement of certain coal-fired generating facilities. Proceeds from the energy transition bonds must be used to provide utility service to customers and for other costs as defined by the ETA. On January 29, 2020, the NM Supreme Court issued a ruling requiring the NMPRC apply the ETA to all aspects of PNM’s SJGS Abandonment Application. On April 1, 2020, the NMPRC unanimously approved the hearing examiners’ recommended decisions regarding the abandonment of SJGS and the related securitized financing under the ETA.
In early 2021, PNM filed the Four Corners Abandonment Application, which sought NMPRC approval to exit PNM’s 13% share of Four Corners as of December 31, 2024, and to issue approximately $300 million of energy transition bonds as provided by the ETA. PNM's request provided background on the prudence of PNM's investment in Four Corners and explained how the proposed sale and abandonment provides a net public benefit. On December 15, 2021, the NMPRC issued a final order denying approval of the Four Corners Abandonment Application and the corresponding request for issuance of securitized financing. On December 22, 2021, PNM filed a Notice of Appeal with the NM Supreme Court of the NMPRC decision to deny the application.
The ETA has and will have a significant impact on PNM’s future generation portfolio, including PNM’s retirement of SJGS in 2022 and the planned Four Corners exit in 2024 (subject to regulatory approval). PNM cannot predict the full impact of the ETA or the outcome of its pending and potential future generating resource abandonment and replacement resource filings with the NMPRC. See additional discussion of the ETA and PNM’s SJGS and Four Corners Abandonment Applications in Notes 16 and 17.
Renewable Energy
The REA was enacted to encourage the development of renewable energy in New Mexico. The ETA amended the REA and requires utilities operating in New Mexico to have renewable portfolios equal to 20% by 2020, 40% by 2025, 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040, and 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045. The REA provides for streamlined proceedings for approval of utilities’ renewable energy procurement plans, provides utilities recovery of costs incurred consistent with approved procurement plans, and sets a RCT for the procurement of renewable resources to prevent excessive costs being added to rates. PNM files required renewable energy plans with the NMPRC annually and makes procurements consistent with the plans approved by the NMPRC. See Note 17.
TNMP 
Operational Information
TNMP is a regulated utility operating and incorporated in the State of Texas. TNMP’s predecessor was organized in 1925. TNMP provides transmission and distribution services in Texas under the provisions of TECA and the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act. TNMP is subject to traditional cost-of-service regulation with respect to rates and service under the jurisdiction of the PUCT and certain municipalities. TNMP’s transmission and distribution activities are solely within ERCOT, which is the independent system operator responsible for maintaining reliable operations for the bulk electric power supply system in most of Texas. Therefore, TNMP is not subject to traditional rate regulation by FERC. TNMP serves a market of small to medium sized communities, most of which have populations of less than 50,000. TNMP is the exclusive provider of transmission and distribution services in most areas it serves. 
TNMP’s service territory consists of three non-contiguous areas. One portion of this territory extends from Lewisville, which is approximately 10 miles north of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, eastward to municipalities near the Red River, and to communities north, west, and south of Fort Worth. The second portion of its service territory includes the area along the Texas Gulf Coast between Houston and Galveston, and the third portion includes areas of far west Texas between Midland and El Paso. TNMP owns 992 miles of electric transmission lines that interconnect with other utilities in Texas. 
A - 4


There has been a significant increase in interconnection requests and cryptocurrency mining applications on the TNMP system, which has necessitated new transmission stations, upgrades at existing stations, and transmission line capacity upgrades.
TNMP provides transmission and distribution services at regulated rates to various REPs that, in turn, provide retail electric service to consumers within TNMP’s service area. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information on rate cases and other regulatory matters.
In mid-February 2021, Texas experienced a severe winter storm delivering the coldest temperatures in 100 years for many parts of the state. As a result, the ERCOT market was not able to deliver sufficient generation load to the grid resulting in significant, statewide outages as ERCOT directed transmission operators to curtail thousands of firm load megawatts. TNMP complied with ERCOT directives to curtail the delivery of electricity in its service territory and did not experience significant outages on its system outside of the ERCOT directed curtailments. For additional information on the Texas winter storm, see Note 16.
For its volumetric load consumers billed on KWh usage, TNMP experienced an increase in weather normalized retail KWh sales of 2.4% in 2022 and a decrease of 0.8% in 2021. For its weather normalized demand-based load, excluding retail transmission consumers, TNMP experienced an increase of 17.3% in 2022 and an increase of 1.8% in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, 109 active REPs receive transmission and distribution services from TNMP. In 2022, the two largest REPs accounted for 27% and 20% of TNMP’s operating revenues. No other consumer accounted for more than 10% of revenues.
TNMP holds long-term, non-exclusive franchise agreements for its electric transmission and distribution services. These agreements have varying expiration dates and some have expired. TNMP intends to negotiate and execute new or amended franchise agreements with municipalities where the agreements have expired or will be expiring. Since TNMP is the exclusive provider of transmission and distribution services in most areas that it serves, the need to renew or renegotiate franchise agreements should not have a material adverse impact. TNMP also earns revenues from service provided to facilities in its service area that lie outside the territorial jurisdiction of the municipalities with which TNMP has franchise agreements.
Regulatory Activities
The rates TNMP charges customers are subject to traditional rate regulation by the PUCT. On January 1, 2019, TNMP implemented a PUCT order in TNMP’s 2018 Rate Case to increase annual base rates by $10.0 million based on a ROE of 9.65%, a cost of debt of 6.44%, and a capital structure comprised of 55% debt and 45% equity. The increase reflects the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. Under the approved settlement stipulation TNMP was granted authority to update depreciation rates and refund the regulatory liability related to federal tax reform to customers.
The PUCT has approved mechanisms that allow TNMP to recover capital invested in transmission and distribution projects without having to file a general rate case. The PUCT approved interim adjustments to TNMP’s transmission rates of $14.1 million in March 2021, $6.3 million in September 2021, $14.2 million in March 2022, and $5.3 million in September 2022. On January 23, 2023, TNMP filed an application to further update its transmission rates, which would increase revenues by $19.4 million annually. The application is pending before the PUCT. The PUCT approved interim adjustments to TNMP’s distribution revenue requirement of $13.5 million in September 2021 and $6.8 million in September 2022. The PUCT also approved rate riders that allow TNMP to recover amounts related to energy efficiency and third-party transmission costs.
Corporate and Other
The Corporate and Other segment includes PNMR holding company activities, primarily related to corporate level debt and the activities of PNMR Services Company. PNMR Services Company provides corporate services through shared services agreements to PNMR and all of PNMR’s business units, including PNM and TNMP. These services are charged and billed at cost on a monthly basis to the business units. The activities of PNMR Development and NMRD are also included in Corporate and Other.
SOURCES OF POWER

1 Represents 10.2% of the power and energy generated by PVNGS. In January 2023, leased capacity of 104 MW in PVNGS Unit 1 expired and the rights to the capacity were acquired by SRP from the lessors. Subsequently, PNM’s interest in PVNGS represents 7.6% and 298 MW.
The NMPRC has approved plans for PNM to procure energy and RECs from additional solar-PV renewable resources totaling 1,090 MW to serve retail customers and a data center located in PNM’s service territory, including the portfolio to replace SJGS with solar PPAs of 550 MW combined with 270 MW of battery storage agreements. The PVNGS Leased Interest Abandonment Application approved by the NMPRC includes solar PPAs of 300 MW combined with 300 MW of battery storage agreements. The majority of these renewable resources are key means for PNM to meet the RPS and related regulations that require PNM to achieve prescribed levels of energy sales from renewable sources, including those set by the recently enacted ETA, without exceeding cost requirements. If adjusted for these plans, the table above would reflect the percentage of generation capacity from fossil-fueled resources of 28.2%, from nuclear resources of 6.8%, and from renewable and battery storage resources of 65.0%. In addition, PNM also has a customer distributed solar generation program that represented 239.1 MW at December 31, 2022.
Fossil‑Fueled Plants
SJGS was a four-unit coal-fired plant operated by PNM. SJGS Units 2 and 3 were retired in December 2017. SJGS Unit 1 was retired in June 2022, and Unit 4 was retired in September 2022.
Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are 13% owned by PNM. These units are jointly owned with APS, SRP, Tucson, and NTEC, and are operated by APS. PNM had no ownership interest in Four Corners Units 1, 2, or 3, which were shut down by APS in 2013. The Four Corners plant site is located on land within the Navajo Nation and is subject to an easement from the federal government. APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to extend the owners’ right to operate the plant on the site to July 2041. In June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into agreements to operate Four Corners seasonally beginning in Fall 2023, subject to the necessary approvals including PNM’s Four Corners Abandonment Application at the NMPRC. Under seasonal operations, a single unit will remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages. In addition, the other unit will be operational throughout the summer season when customer demand is the highest. PNM filed the Four Corners Abandonment Application, which sought NMPRC approval to exit PNM’s 13% share of Four Corners as of December 31, 2024. See Note 17.
A - 6


PNM owns 100% of Reeves, Afton, Rio Bravo, Lordsburg, and La Luz and one-third of Luna. The remaining interests in Luna are owned equally by Tucson and Samchully Power & Utilities 1, LLC. PNM is also entitled to the entire output of Valencia under a PPA. Reeves, Lordsburg, Rio Bravo, La Luz, and Valencia are used primarily for peaking power and transmission support. As discussed in Note 10, Valencia is a variable interest entity and is consolidated by PNM.
Nuclear Plant 
PNM is participating in the three units of PVNGS with APS (the operating agent), SRP, EPE, SCE, SCPPA, and the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles. Currently, PNM has ownership interests of 2.3% in Unit 1, 9.4% in Unit 2, and 10.2% in Unit 3 and has leasehold interests of 0.8% in Unit 2. The lease payments for the leased portions of PVNGS are recovered through retail rates approved by the NMPRC. 
On April 5, 2021, PNM and SRP entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, pursuant to which PNM agreed to sell to SRP certain PNM-owned assets and nuclear fuel necessary to the ongoing operation and maintenance of leased capacity in PVNGS Unit 1 and Unit 2, which SRP has agreed to acquire from the lessors upon termination of the existing leases. The proposed transaction between PNM and SRP received all necessary approvals, and in January 2023, the Unit 1 leases expired and PNM relinquished the associated 7.9% entitlement share of the power and energy generated by Unit 1. The remaining Unit 2 lease will expire in January 2024. See Notes 16 and 17 for information on other PVNGS matters including the PVNGS Leased Interest Abandonment Application and Note 8 for additional information concerning the PVNGS leases.
Renewables
At December 31, 2022, PNM owns 158 MW of solar facilities in commercial operation. In addition, PNM purchases renewable power under long-term PPAs to serve New Mexico retail customers, including a data center located in PNM’s service territory. At December 31, 2022, renewable energy procured under these agreements from wind, solar-PV, and geothermal facilities aggregated to 658 MW, 230 MW, and 11 MW. These agreements currently have expiration dates beginning in January 2035 and extending through May 2047. The NMPRC has approved PNM’s request to enter into additional PPAs for renewable energy for an additional 1,090 MW of energy from solar-PV facilities combined with 620 MW of battery storage agreements with an anticipated 350 MW expected to come online in 2023. The entire portfolio of replacement resources approved by the NMPRC in PNM’s SJGS Abandonment Application includes replacement of SJGS capacity with the procurement of 550 MW of solar PPAs combined with 270 MW of battery storage agreements. The PVNGS Leased Interest Abandonment Application approved by the NMPRC for replacement of 114 MW of PVNGS capacity and to ensure system reliability and load needs are met includes procurement of 300 MW of solar PPAs combined with 300 MW of battery storage agreements. In addition, the NMPRC issued an order that will allow PNM to service a data center for an additional 190 MW of solar PPA combined with 50 MW of battery storage and a 50 MW solar PPA expected to be operational in 2023. See Note 17.
A summary of purchased power, excluding Valencia, is as follows:

Joint Projects
SJGS, PVNGS, Four Corners, and Luna are joint projects each owned or leased by several different entities. Some participants in the joint projects are investor-owned entities, while others are privately, municipally, or co-operatively owned. Furthermore, participants in SJGS had varying percentage interest in different generating units within the project and have different percentage interest with respect to plant decommissioning and coal mine reclamation obligations. On April 1, 2020, 
A - 7


the NMPRC approved the abandonment of PNM’s remaining interest in SJGS on June 30, 2022. On February 17 2022, PNM filed a request with the NMPRC to extend operation of SJGS Unit 4 until September 30, 2022. The filing provided that PNM had obtained agreement from the SJGS owners to extend operation of Unit 4, but was unable to secure the extended operation of Unit 1. See Note 17 for additional information about PNM’s SJGS Abandonment Application.
The primary operating or participation agreements for the other joint projects expire July 2041 for Four Corners, December 2046 for Luna, and November 2047 for PVNGS. As described above, Four Corners is located on land within the Navajo Nation and is subject to an easement from the federal government. On January 8, 2021, PNM filed the Four Corners Abandonment Application, which sought NMPRC approval to exit PNM’s 13% share of Four Corners as of December 31, 2024. See Note 17 for additional information about PNM’s Four Corners Abandonment Application. Portions of PNM’s interests in PVNGS are held under leases. See Nuclear Plant above and Note 8 regarding PNM’s actions related to these leases. 
It is possible that other participants in the joint projects have circumstances and objectives that have changed from those existing at the time of becoming participants. The status of these joint projects is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the form of potential legislation and/or regulation of GHG, other air emissions, and CCRs, as well as the impacts of the costs of compliance and operational viability of all or certain units within the joint projects. It is unclear how these factors will enter into discussions and negotiations concerning the status of the joint projects as the expiration of basic operational agreements approaches. PNM can provide no assurance that its participation in the joint projects will continue in the manner that currently exists.
TNMP
TNMP provides only transmission and distribution services and does not sell power.
FUEL 
PNM
The percentages (on the basis of KWh) of PNM’s generation of electricity, including Valencia, fueled by coal, nuclear fuel, and gas and oil, and the average costs to PNM of those fuels per MMBTU were as follows:

 | Coal | | Nuclear | | Gas 
 | Percent ofGeneration | | AverageCost | | Percent ofGeneration | AverageCost | | Percent ofGeneration | AverageCost
2022 | 36.7 | % | | $ | 2.97 | | 35.4 | % | $ | 0.73 | 23.9 | % | $ | 7.61
2021 | 44.3 | % | | $ | 3.02 | | 34.8 | % | $ | 0.68 | 16.8 | % | $ | 6.02

In both 2022 and 2021, 4.1% of PNM’s generation was from utility-owned solar, which has no fuel cost. The generation mix for 2023, including power procured under long-term PPAs, is expected to be 12.4% coal, 26.7% nuclear, 30.9% gas, and 30.0% from renewable resources, including solar, wind, and geothermal. Due to locally available natural gas, the utilization of locally available coal deposits, and the generally adequate supply of nuclear fuel, PNM believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future. See Sources of Power – PNM – Renewables for information concerning the cost of purchased power. PNM recovers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power costs through the FPPAC.
Coal
SJGS and Four Corners are coal-fired generating plants that obtain their coal requirements from mines near the plants. Substantially all of PNM’s coal costs are passed on to PNM’s customers under the FPPAC. The coal supply contract for SJGS expired on September 30, 2022. The coal supply arrangement for Four Corners runs through July 6, 2031 and provides for pricing adjustments over its term based on economic indices. In connection with the proposed exit of Four Corners, PNM would make payments totaling $75.0 million to NTEC for relief from its obligations under the coal supply agreement for Four Corners after December 31, 2024. 
See Note 16 for additional information about PNM’s coal supply arrangements. See Note 17 for additional information about PNM’s SJGS Abandonment Application, PNM’s Four Corners Abandonment Application, and PNM’s IRP, which all focus on a carbon-free electricity portfolio by 2040 that would eliminate coal at the end of 2024.
Natural Gas
The natural gas used as fuel for the electric generating plants is procured on the open market and delivered by third-party transportation providers. The supply of natural gas can be subject to disruptions due to extreme weather events and/or pipeline or facility outages. PNM has contracted for firm gas transmission capacity to minimize the potential for disruptions due to extreme weather events. Certain of PNM’s natural gas plants are generally used as peaking resources that are highly relied upon during seasonally high load periods and/or during periods of extreme weather, which also may be the times natural gas has the highest demand from other users. Substantially all of PNM’s natural gas costs are recovered through the FPPAC.

Nuclear Fuel and Waste
PNM is one of several participants in PVNGS. The PVNGS participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The PVNGS participants have contracted for 100% of PVNGS’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2025 and an average of 61% through 2030. Additional needed supplies are covered through existing inventories or spot market transactions. For conversion services, 100% are contracted through 2025 and an average of 90% through 2030. Additional needed conversion services are covered through existing inventories or spot market transactions. For enrichment services, 80% is contracted through 2026. For fuel assembly fabrication 100% is contracted through 2027.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the DOE to begin to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998. The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a contract with each nuclear power plant. The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998. APS (on behalf of itself and the other PVNGS participants) pursued legal actions for which settlements were reached. See Note 16 for information concerning these actions. 
The DOE had planned to meet its disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the NRC. Several legal proceedings followed challenging DOE’s withdrawal of its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. None of these lawsuits have been conclusively decided. However, the DC Circuit ordered the NRC to resume its review of the application. The results of the NRC’s review publications do not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository.
All spent nuclear fuel from PVNGS is being stored on-site. PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license periods, which end in December 2027. Additionally, PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the extended license periods, which end in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the U.S. government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, the PVNGS participants will evaluate alternative storage solutions. These may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the extended license periods. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Electric utilities are subject to stringent laws and regulations for protection of the environment by local, state, federal, and tribal authorities. In addition, PVNGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC, which has the authority to issue permits and licenses and to regulate nuclear facilities in order to protect the health and safety of the public from radioactive hazards and to conduct environmental reviews. The liabilities under these laws and regulations can be material. In some instances, liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault, or may be imposed for past acts, whether or not such acts were lawful at the time they occurred. See MD&A – Other Issues Facing the Company – Climate Change Issues for information on GHG. In addition, Note 16 contains information related to the following matters, incorporated in this item by reference:
•PVNGS Decommissioning Funding
•Nuclear Spent Fuel and Waste Disposal
•The Energy Transition Act
•Environmental Matters under the caption “The Clean Air Act”
•Cooling Water Intake Structures
•Effluent Limitation Guidelines
•Santa Fe Generating Station
•Environmental Matters under the caption “Coal Combustion Residuals Waste Disposal”
COMPETITION
Regulated utilities are generally not subject to competition from other utilities in areas that are under the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions. In New Mexico, PNM does not have direct competition for services provided to its retail electric customers. In Texas, TNMP is not currently in any direct retail competition with any other regulated electric utility. However, PNM and TNMP are subject to customer conservation and energy efficiency activities, as well as initiatives to utilize alternative energy sources, including self-generation, or otherwise bypass the PNM and TNMP systems.
PNM is subject to varying degrees of competition in certain territories adjacent to or within the areas it serves. This competition comes from other utilities in its region as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities.  PNM is involved in the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market to serve its New Mexico retail customers.  PNM is subject to competition from regional utilities and merchant power suppliers with similar opportunities to generate and sell energy at market-based prices and larger trading entities that do not own or operate generating assets.
