ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
We are a global life sciences company focused on providing innovative preparedness and response solutions addressing accidental, deliberate and naturally occurring public health threats ("PHTs"). Our solutions include a product portfolio, a product development portfolio, and a contract development and manufacturing ("CDMO") services portfolio. The types of PHTs we are currently addressing are focused on the following five categories:
•chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives ("CBRNE"); 
•emerging infectious diseases ("EID"); 
•travel health, which we have agreed to sell to Bavarian Nordic, as described below; 
•public health crises (such as the opioid crisis and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic); and 
•acute, emergency, and community care. 
Our revenues are derived from a combination of the sale and procurement of our product/product candidate portfolio (described below), the provision of our CDMO services to external customers, and non-dilutive contract and grant funding for research and development ("R&D") projects from various third-party sources.
OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS
Beginning in 2022, we report financial results for our business under the following two operating segments:
•our Products Segment consisting of Government - MCM and Commercial products; and 
•our Services Segment consisting of our CDMO services portfolio.
Additionally, we have a centralized R&D organization and an enterprise-wide governance approach to managing our portfolio of R&D projects.
Products Segment
Government - MCM Products
Our Government - MCM business focuses primarily on procurement of MCM products and procured product candidates by domestic and international government customers, with an emphasis on the United States ("U.S.") Government ("USG"), which is our largest customer. We also sell MCM products and procured product candidates to domestic and international non-government organizations and to governments outside of the U.S.
Commercial Products
In the U.S. and international markets, our Commercial business primarily focuses on sales of NARCAN® (naloxone HCI) Nasal Spray and our travelers' vaccines. NARCAN® Nasal Spray is sold commercially through physician-directed or standing order prescriptions at retail pharmacies and to state and local governments and first responders including police, firefighters and emergency medical teams. Our travelers' vaccines include Vaxchora® (Cholera Vaccine, Live, Oral) and Vivotif® (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a), which are approved for use in the U.S. and other territories, and are sold primarily to travel clinics, retail pharmacies, vaccination centers, health departments, and integrated hospital networks. 
On February 15, 2023, we entered into the Sale Agreement with Bavarian Nordic, under which we agreed to sell our travel health business, including rights to Vaxchora and Vivotif, as well as our development-stage chikungunya vaccine candidate CHIKV VLP, our manufacturing site in Bern, Switzerland and certain of our development facilities in San Diego, California for a cash purchase price of $270.0 million, subject to certain customary adjustments. In addition, we may receive milestone payments of up to $80.0 million related to the development of CHIKV VLP and receipt of marketing approval and authorization in the U.S. and Europe, and sales-based milestones payments of up to $30.0 million based on aggregate net sales of Vaxchora and Vivotif in calendar year 2026. Approximately 280 employees are expected to join Bavarian Nordic as part of the transaction.
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to certain customary closing conditions, including (1) the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (2) receipt of required clearances and approvals under Spain’s competition laws, (3) receipt of certain Swiss real property approvals, (4) no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to the business, and (5) certain other customary conditions.
Services Segment
CDMO Services
Our portfolio of CDMO services consists of three distinct but interrelated service pillars: development services (process and analytical development); drug substance manufacturing; and drug product manufacturing (fill/finish). These services, which we collectively refer to as a “molecule-to-market” offering, employ diverse technology platforms across a network of development and manufacturing sites operated by us. These CDMO services support all phases of the drug development life cycle, from pre-clinical development programs through commercial manufacturing of approved pharmaceutical products. The customer base for CDMO services is primarily innovators in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical segments.
OUR STRATEGY
In second half of 2022, we conducted an evaluation of our corporate performance relative to our 2020-2024 Strategic Plan and of changes to the external environment in which the Company operates. We decided to replace the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan with a new three-year strategy (2023-2025). Our management believes this three-year plan is necessary to strengthen the Company’s financial position and adapt to new strategic priorities. We expect that this strategy will refocus the business and increase the Company’s ability to make more aggressive investments for future growth.
For 2023-2025, our priorities will align with a sharpened focus on:
MCMs and Commercial Products — We will focus on products including NARCAN Nasal Spray and on public health preparedness and response, which will leverage our longstanding relationship as a reliable partner to the U.S. and allied governments helping protect against chemical, biological and man-made threats.
Contract Development and Manufacturing Services — We will focus our investments in our existing network of manufacturing sites to strengthen operational, quality, and compliance systems across the enterprise to provide reliable delivery of products and services for both our own products and those of our CDMO customers. 
Align R&D Portfolio to focus on areas of leadership — We will continue to focus on advancing our pipeline of vaccines and therapeutic product candidates, with the aim of developing differentiated products that address unmet needs in the PHT space. We fund our pipeline development by investing our own funds and through securing government contracts, grants, or other non-dilutive funding.

Description of MCM Products
ACAM2000®. ACAM2000 vaccine is a smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA and comprises the largest percentage of the current USG stockpile in the Strategic National Stockpile ("SNS") designated for use in a bioterrorism emergency. ACAM2000 vaccine is currently stockpiled both in the U.S. and internationally. Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the Variola virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC"), smallpox is a devastating disease, with a mortality rate as high as 30%. The vaccine stimulates a person's immune system to develop antibodies and cells in the blood and elsewhere that can then help the body fight off a smallpox infection if exposure to smallpox occurs. On September 3, 2019, we announced the award by the USG of a contract valued at up to approximately $2 billion over 10 years for the continued supply of ACAM2000 vaccine into the SNS, assuming all contract options are exercised. This multiple-year contract is intended to support the replacement of the smallpox vaccine stockpile and included a one-year base period of performance in 2019 valued at approximately $170.0 million, and nine option years. The number of doses under the base period were delivered by year end 2019. On May 28, 2020, we announced the exercise by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") of the first contract option, valued at $176.0 million, to procure doses of ACAM2000 vaccine. The number of doses under the first contract option were delivered by year end 2020. On July 13, 2021, we announced the exercise by HHS of the second contract option, valued at $182.2 million, to procure doses of ACAM2000 vaccine. We completed the delivery of all ACAM2000 doses in 2022. The USG chose to not exercise its option year in 2022. Therefore, we are currently in discussions with HHS regarding future procurement of ACAM2000 vaccine and what is necessary for the USG to maintain ACAM2000 in the SNS. The actual number of ACAM2000 doses to be procured in the future are subject to the outcome of our discussions.
Anthrasil®. Anthrasil [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] ("Anthrasil Anthrax IGIV") is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. We currently have two contracts with HHS for Anthrasil Anthrax IGIV: a development and procurement contract that expires in September 2023, and a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, as well as the manufacture of such plasma into bulk drug substance and finished drug product and delivery of finished product into the SNS. This contract covers extended plasma storage, and the options for manufacturing and product delivery, which are available to be exercised by HHS through September 2023. In addition to domestic USG sales, Anthrasil Anthrax IGIV has been sold to several foreign governments, including the Canadian government. 
BAT®. BAT antitoxin is the only equine plasma antitoxin licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of all seven botulinum neurotoxin serotypes. BAT antitoxin is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic botulism following suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C, D, E, F or G in adults and pediatric patients. It is also licensed in Canada pursuant to Health Canada’s Extraordinary Use New Drugs regulations. BAT antitoxin is the only heptavalent botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. and Canada for treating naturally occurring botulism in adults or pediatric patients. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness. On May 8, 2020, we announced the finalization of a previously announced contract with HHS, valued at up to $550.0 million, if all options under the contract are exercised. The contract has two deliverables. The first deliverable, negotiated in September 2019 and valued at up to approximately $90.0 million, is to supply annual doses of BAT antitoxin into the SNS for 10 years by converting existing bulk drug substance into final drug product. This deliverable also includes options for additional doses valued at up to approximately $94.0 million over 10 years. The second deliverable, valued at up to approximately $366.0 million, is for the production of additional doses of bulk drug substance over 10 years to maintain the plasma collection and production capability for botulism response planning. In addition to domestic government sales, BAT antitoxin continues to be sold internationally, with deliveries to over 17 foreign governments in 2022.
BioThrax®. BioThrax vaccine is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for pre-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease in persons at high risk of exposure. BioThrax vaccine is also approved by the FDA for post-exposure prophylaxis administration in combination with antimicrobial therapy in the event of suspected or confirmed exposure to Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax. In the U.S., BioThrax vaccine is administered in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting by intramuscular injection as a three-dose primary series over a six-month period. Per the U.S. label, booster doses are administered six and 12 months after completion of the primary series and at 12- month intervals thereafter. BioThrax vaccine is administered in a post-exposure prophylaxis setting as three subcutaneous injections two weeks apart in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs following suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure. When we report the revenue associated with “anthrax vaccines,” it reflects the combined revenue from the procurement and sale of BioThrax vaccine as well as the product candidate AV7909 (described below).
In December 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC for the supply of up to approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax vaccine for delivery into the SNS, over a five-year period ending in September 2021. On September 29, 2021, we were granted a no-cost contract extension, which extended the date through which the USG procured BioThrax vaccine to March 31, 2022. On June 16, 2022, the contract's period of performance was extended to June 30, 2022. All deliveries under this contract were completed in August 2022.
Ebanga™ (Ansuvimab-zykl), a monoclonal antibody. Ebanga™ (Ansuvimab-zykl) is a monoclonal antibody with antiviral activity provided through a single IV infusion (over 60 minutes) for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for Zaire ebolavirus. On July 1, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics (“Ridgeback”) in which the parties agreed to negotiate a Collaboration Agreement to expand the availability of Ebanga™ (Ansuvimab-zykl). We will be responsible for manufacturing, selling and distributing Ebanga™ (Ansuvimab-zykl) in the U.S. and Canada and Ridgeback will serve as the global access partner.
Raxibacumab injection, a fully human monoclonal antibody. Our raxibacumab product is the first fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Our raxibacumab product is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or appropriate.
RSDL®. RSDL kit is cleared by the FDA that is intended to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents from the skin, including tabun, sarin, soman, cyclohexyl sarin, VR, VX, mustard gas and T-2 toxin. RSDL kit has also been cleared as a medical device by Health Canada, has a current European Conformity ("CE") mark under European Directives, and is licensed by the Israel Ministry of Health and by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. To date, the principal customers for RSDL kits have been agencies of the USG, including the Department of Defense ("DoD") and the National Guard. In addition to the DoD and other USG agencies, beginning in 2017, we made RSDL kit available for the first time for purchase by civilians in the U.S. Our current contract with the DoD awarded in December 2022 is a five-year contract including a base year period and four single year option periods, valued at up to $379.6 million to supply RSDL kits for use by all branches of the U.S. military. We also sold RSDL kits to nine foreign countries outside the U.S. in 2022. In November 2022, a specific batch of our RSDL kits was recalled due to leakage, which could cause the product not to perform as effectively as intended. There have been no reports of injuries or death related to this recall of which we are aware.
TEMBEXA® (brincidofovir). TEMBEXA is the first oral antiviral approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox disease caused by variola virus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates. On September 26, 2022, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to brincidofovir from Chimerix Inc. for the treatment of any human smallpox disease or any other disease caused by any orthopox virus. Following the acquisition, the 10-year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA"), valued at up to $680.0 million, to supply up to 1.7 million tablet and suspension formulations of TEMBEXA was novated to the Company.
Trobigard® atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride auto-injector. TROBIGARD auto-injector was approved by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products of the Belgium Health Authority on February 18, 2021. TROBIGARD auto-injector is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA. TROBIGARD auto-injector is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the U.S. In Belgium, the TROBIGARD auto-injector is indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected exposure to nerve agents or toxic organophosphates in adults (> 18 years of age). In February 2019, Emergent was awarded a 10-year contract, valued at up to approximately $100.0 million, by the U.S. Department of State, to procure our TROBIGARD product, training auto-injectors and RSDL kits for emergency use outside of the U.S. The contract consists of a five-year base period of performance with five one-year option periods. 
VIGIV CNJ-016®. VIGIV is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada to address certain complications from replicating virus smallpox vaccination. The principal customer for VIGIV is the USG, specifically HHS. In June 2019, we announced a contract award by HHS valued at approximately $535.0 million over 10 years for the continued supply of VIGIV into the SNS for smallpox preparedness. VIGIV has also been procured by a limited number of foreign governments.

Description of Commercial Products
NARCAN®. NARCAN Nasal Spray, a product we obtained in connection with our acquisition of Adapt Pharma Inc. in 2018, is an intranasal formulation of naloxone approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose as demonstrated by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. The primary customers for NARCAN Nasal Spray are state health departments, local law enforcement agencies, community-based organizations, substance abuse centers, federal agencies and consumers through pharmacies fulfilling physician-directed or standing order prescriptions. We completed two important product life cycle improvements in 2020. First, we launched the Generation II NARCAN device, which has a claim for enhanced temperature excursions and storage below 25°C. Second, we gained FDA approval for an extension of the shelf life of NARCAN Nasal Spray from 24 months to 36 months.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we filed our supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for NARCAN® (naloxone HCI) Nasal Spray, as an over-the-counter ("OTC") emergency treatment for known or suspected opioid overdose. The FDA accepted the application and also granted Priority Review. If approved, it would be the first 4 mg naloxone nasal spray available OTC in the U.S. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") goal date is March 29, 2023. On February, 15, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee unanimously voted in favor (a total of 19 votes) that the benefit-risk profile of NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray was supportive of its use as a nonprescription opioid overdose reversal agent. The FDA is not bound by the committees’ guidance but will take its advice into consideration. 
Vaxchora®. Vaxchora vaccine is a live attenuated cholera vaccine for oral administration and the first vaccine approved by the FDA for the prevention of cholera infection. Cholera is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. It has a low incidence in the U.S. and Europe, but a high incidence in Africa, Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas have historically drawn travelers 
from the U.S. and Europe, so cholera can occur in patients who return to the U.S. or Europe from visits to these regions. Vaxchora vaccine is approved in the U.S. for active immunization against disease caused by V. cholerae serogroup 01 in persons two to 64 years of age traveling to cholera-affected areas. Vaxchora vaccine is indicated in the European Union ("EU") for active immunization against disease caused by V. cholerae serogroup 01 in adults and children aged two years and older.
We have marketed Vaxchora vaccine to travelers primarily from the U.S. to cholera at-risk destinations. Our sales of Vaxchora vaccine were diminished in 2020 and 2021 due to the broad disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaxchora vaccine was launched in the EU in August 2022. In February 2023, we agreed to sell Vaxchora as part of the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic.
Vivotif®. Vivotif vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine for oral administration to prevent typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening febrile illness caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, a bacterium that only lives in humans. It is usually acquired by consumption of water or food that has been contaminated by feces of an infected person. Travelers from North America and Europe going to Asia, Africa, and Latin America have historically been particularly at risk. In February 2023 we agreed to sell Vivotif as part of the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic.
We have marketed Vivotif vaccine to travelers primarily from the U.S. and the EU traveling to at-risk destinations. Our sales of Vivotif vaccine were diminished in 2020 and 2021 due to the broad disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales of Vivotif vaccine resumed in 2022 and we expect that global travel will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023.

Description of Product Candidates
AV7909. We are developing AV7909, an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on anthrax vaccine adsorbed combined with an adjuvant for post-exposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed exposure to Bacillus anthracis in persons 18 through 65 years of age when administered in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs. In 2021, AV7909 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA. Studies have shown that AV7909 elicits a stronger immune response using fewer doses than BioThrax vaccine, which is expected to allow patients to reach a protective level 
of immunity more rapidly. AV7909 is designed to provide protection with a two-dose regimen (versus the BioThrax three-dose regimen) for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease, when administered in combination with the recommended antibacterial drugs. In September 2016, we signed a combination development and procurement contract with BARDA, which included a five-year base period of performance to develop AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses, subsequently modified to three million doses in March 2017. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50.0 million doses of AV7909 into the SNS and options for an additional clinical study and post marketing commitments. In 2019, we initiated and completed enrollment of a Phase 3 study; the 3,850 subject trial evaluating safety, immunogenicity and lot consistency was completed in 2020. In collaboration with us, the CDC filed with the FDA a pre-EUA submission package related to AV7909. Following this submission, BARDA began procuring AV7909, exercising its first contract option in July 2019 (valued at approximately $261.0 million) to procure doses to be delivered to the SNS through June of 2020, its second contract option in June 2020 (valued at $258.0 million) to procure additional doses of AV7909 for delivery into the SNS over 12 months and, most recently, in September 2021 funding another contract option (valued at approximately $399.0 million) to deliver doses of AV7909 to the SNS over 18 months. In April 2022, we completed our submission of a Biologics License Application ("BLA") for AV7909 to the FDA. When we report the revenue associated with “anthrax vaccines,” it reflects the combined revenue from the procurement and sale of AV7909 as well as BioThrax (described above).
CGRD-001. The CGRD-001 auto-injector is being developed for treatment of poisoning by organophosphorus nerve agents, as well as organophosphorus compounds for use by military personnel. CGRD-001 is being developed as an auto-injector for delivery of 600 mg of pralidoxime and 2 mg of atropine for intramuscular injection following nerve agent exposure. The product is being designed for injection by non-medical personnel, including self-injection or buddy aid by service members. Currently we are manufacturing registration batches and undergoing design verification. 
CHIKV VLP. We are developing a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate, CHIKV VLP, to be administered as a single dose for active immunization against chikungunya disease. There is currently no licensed vaccine, VLP or otherwise, to prevent chikungunya virus disease. The structure of the CHIKV VLP vaccine is nearly identical to the wild-type virus but does not pose a risk of replication. Studies conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ("NIAID") Vaccine Research Center and Emergent have shown that the CHIKV VLP vaccine is well-tolerated and elicits high titer neutralizing antibodies, which are needed to protect against chikungunya virus. CHIKV VLP is currently being investigated in two pivotal phase 3 trials. Our CHIKV VLP vaccine candidate received Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation from the FDA in October 2020 and May 2018, respectively, and PRIME designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2019. In February 2023, we agreed to sell CHIKV VLP as part of the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic.
EBS-LASV. This vaccine candidate is a recombinant, vesicular stomatitis virus vectored, monovalent vaccine encoding the surface glycoprotein precursor gene of Lassa virus. The development program is partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ("CEPI") and is currently in Phase 1 with the trial ongoing in Ghana. CEPI will decide on Phase 2 funding in the second quarter of 2023. A correlate of protection is not yet identified. 
EGRD-001. The EGRD-001 auto-injector is being developed for treatment of status epilepticus and severe recurrent convulsive seizures caused by nerve agent poisoning, for use by military personnel and first responders. EGRD-001 is being developed as an auto-injector for the intramuscular delivery of 10 mg of diazepam in individuals who are actively seizing.
SIAN. We are developing SIAN (stabilized Isoamyl nitrate) as an antidote for initial treatment of acute poisoning of cyanide that is judged to be serious or life threatening. The USG consistently identifies cyanide ("CN") as a high-priority threat, most recently in the Public Health Emergency medical Countermeasure Enterprise 2022 Strategy and Implementation Plan. Historically, CN has been used as a chemical warfare agent and could be an agent for a terrorist attack. CN also represents a threat from accidental poisoning, such as industrial accidents or exposure during building fires. The SIAN program is funded by BARDA and is focused on the development of a single-use intranasal spray device that can be rapidly deployed and easily dispensed so that it will deliver SIAN following a cyanide incident or in a mass exposure setting. In 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of our SIAN product candidate.
UniFlu. We are developing a universal influenza vaccine candidate based on a nanoparticle technology involving a cross-reactive hemagglutinin (HA) antigen for active immunization against influenza virus A and B. The nanoparticle technology was developed by and licensed from the NIAID Vaccine Research Center. Using this technology, we are seeking to develop a universal influenza vaccine designed to confer protection against numerous strains and subtypes of influenza virus. In 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 study designed to assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the influenza virus A 
components of the vaccine candidate with future studies planned to investigate additional components, including for full coverage against all influenza virus A and B strains.

Marketing and Sales
We have dedicated sales channels for each of our products and service offerings.
Government - MCM Products.
We partner with stakeholders in the USG and domestic NGOs to support procurement of our MCM products and procured product candidates.
We also partner with foreign governments and international NGOs to support procurement of MCM products and procured product candidates internationally.
Our specialized team has expertise and experience in the public and private sector, dealing with counter terrorism, CBRNE preparedness and public health. 
Commercial Products.
In the U.S. market, NARCAN (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray is sold directly to state and local governments and used by first responders, including: police, firefighters and emergency medical teams. In addition, NARCAN Nasal Spray is dispensed to patients at risk of an opioid overdose through retail pharmacies as prescribed by a physician. In 2022, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) requesting that FDA switch Narcan (4mg) from a prescription drug to an over-the-counter medicine. The PDUFA goal date for that application is March 29, 2023. On February, 15, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee unanimously voted in favor (a total of 19 votes) that the benefit-risk profile of NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray was supportive of its use as a nonprescription opioid overdose reversal agent. The FDA is not bound by the committees’ guidance but will take its advice into consideration. 
Vivotif® and Vaxchora® vaccines are intended for use by travelers heading to regions where there is a risk of exposure to certain infectious diseases and, therefore, are sold to channels that address travel health. We sell to both wholesalers and distributors. The primary commercial customers of Vivotif and Vaxchora vaccines are travel clinics, retail pharmacies, vaccination centers, health departments and integrated hospital networks. Sales of these products were significantly reduced in 2020 and 2021 due to the broader disruption to travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales of Vivotif vaccine fully resumed in 2022. Vaxchora vaccine was launched in the EU and sales of Vaxchora vaccine are expected in the first quarter of 2023 in the U.S. We expect sales to be influenced by the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global travel.
CDMO Services.
We market our CDMO services to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, governments and NGOs. We also provided CDMO services to the USG, which ended in 2021. Our CDMO services are supported by a dedicated group of professionals qualified to represent the full breadth of our service offerings.
Competition
 Our products and any product or product candidate that we acquire or successfully develop and commercialize are likely to compete with current products and product candidates that are in development for the same indications. The competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:
•ACAM2000®. ACAM2000 vaccine remains the primary smallpox vaccine stockpiled by the USG and offers key features for public health mass vaccination programs that are critical, including a single dose vaccination schedule and multi-dose vial presentation. ACAM2000 vaccine faces competition from JYNNEOSTM vaccine, which is licensed by the FDA for the prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or mpox infection. JYNNEOS vaccine is also approved in Canada and in the EU under the trade names IMVAMUNE® and IMVANEX®, respectively. 
•AV7909 and BioThrax. AV7909 and BioThrax vaccines are currently procured, primarily by the USG, for prevention of anthrax disease. BioThrax vaccine is currently the only anthrax vaccine approved by the FDA for prevention of anthrax disease, and AV7909 and BioThrax are the only anthrax vaccines procured by the USG for the SNS to date. We face potential future competition for the supply of anthrax vaccines if the USG chooses to procure alternative products or product candidates. Altimmune, Inc., GC Pharma, Blue Willow Biologics, and Greffex are each currently developing anthrax vaccine product candidates, which are in various stages of clinical development. Of these product candidates, Altimmune and Blue Willow Biologics have completed Phase 1 trials.
•BAT®. Our botulinum antitoxin immune globulin product is the only heptavalent antitoxin licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of symptomatic botulism for all seven botulinum neurotoxin serotypes. Direct competition is currently limited.
•CNJ-016®. Our VIGIV product is the only therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada to address adverse events from smallpox vaccination with replicating virus smallpox vaccines. While direct competition in terms of the treatment of smallpox vaccination side effects is limited, SIGA has obtained EU approval for TPOXX® (tecovirimat), an oral therapy, for the treatment of complications following vaccination against smallpox. TPOXX is currently procured by the USG for the SNS.
•EbangaTM (Ansuvimab-zykl). A monoclonal antibody therapeutic approved by the FDA in December 2020 for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire Ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to RT-PCR+ mother for Zaire Ebolavirus infection. Ebanga faces competition from another monoclonal antibody, Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn), which was approved by the FDA in October 2020 with the same indication. Inmazeb is currently procured by the USG for the SNS.
•NARCAN®. NARCAN Nasal Spray is the first FDA-approved intranasal naloxone spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and its Canadian affiliate (collectively, Teva) have generic versions of an intranasal naloxone spray based on NARCAN approved by the FDA and Health Canada. Teva launched its generic naloxone nasal spray in the U.S. In 2021 Padagis Pharmaceuticals also has a generic version of an intranasal naloxone spray based on NARCAN approved by the FDA. Padagis launched its generic naloxone nasal spray. NARCAN Nasal Spray also faces branded competition: Kloxxado™ (naloxone HCI) nasal spray 8 mg, a branded product developed by Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s naloxone injection product, Teleflex Medical Inc's Intranasal Mucosal Atomization Device and Zimhi™ (naloxone), a branded injectable product developed by Adamis. In addition, Harm Reduction Therapeutics has announced filing of an OTC NDA application for a 3mg naloxone nasal spray formulation intended for use in opioid overdose reversal. NARCAN may face additional generic and branded competition in the future.
•Raxibacumab and Anthrasil® [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (human)]. Our raxibacumab product is the first FDA-licensed fully human anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic and Anthrasil [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (human)] is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. has obtained FDA licensure for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) injection, a chimeric (or partially human) antibody indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Obiltoxaximab is also approved in Canada and the EU.
•RSDL®. In the U.S., the RSDL Kit is one of only two medical device cleared by the FDA to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin. Internationally, various Ministries of Defense have procured Fullers Earth, Dutch Powder and French Powder as a preparedness countermeasure for the decontamination of liquid chemical weapons from the skin.
•TEMBEXA® (brincidofovir). TEMBEXA is the first oral antiviral approved by the FDA, in June 2021, for all age groups for the treatment of smallpox. TEMBEXA faces competition from TPOXX® (tecovirimat), an oral therapy for the treatment of smallpox disease that was approved by the FDA in July 2018 and is currently procured by the USG for the SNS. TPOXX is also approved in Canada and the EU. In the EU, TPOXX is indicated for the treatment of smallpox, mpox and cowpox, as well as the treatment of complications following vaccination against smallpox.
•Trobigard® atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride auto-injector. In the U.S., Meridian Medical Technologies has been the primary supplier of nerve-agent antidote auto-injectors. The USG has funded the development of a number of nerve agent antidote auto-injectors including development programs at Aktiv Pharma Group, Kaleo and others. Outside of the U.S. there are a number of suppliers of these devices though few with approvals from national or regional regulatory authorities.
•Vaxchora®. In the U.S., Vaxchora vaccine is the only FDA-licensed vaccine available indicated to prevent cholera. Vaxchora vaccine is the only single-dose cholera vaccine in the EU and is subject to competition by Valneva’s Dukoral® two-dose cholera vaccine in the EU. In February 2023, we agreed to sell Vaxchora as part of the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic.
•Vivotif®. Vivotif vaccine is the only FDA-approved oral typhoid vaccine. In the markets where Vivotif vaccine is licensed, it competes primarily with Sanofi Pasteur’s Typhim VI® vaccine, an injectable polysaccharide typhoid vaccine. In February 2023, we agreed to sell Vivotif as part of the sale of our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic.
CDMO Services
We also compete for CDMO services with a number of biopharmaceutical product R&D organizations, contract manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products, other CDMO organizations, and university research laboratories. 
Companies with which we compete to provide CDMO services include, among others: Lonza Group Ltd., Catalent, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Curia Global, Inc., Charles River Laboratories, Avid Bioservices, KBI Biopharma, Vetter Pharma, and FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies. We also compete with in-house research, development and support service departments of other biopharmaceutical companies.
MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
Our development and manufacturing network allows us to deploy capabilities and capacity for clinical and commercial supply needs. 
Supplies and Raw Materials
We currently rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to manufacture some of the supplies we require for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as supplies and raw materials used in the production of our products. Typically, we acquire these supplies and raw materials on a purchase order basis and, when possible, in quantities we believe adequate to meet our needs. We obtain Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, used to manufacture AV7909 and BioThrax vaccines, from a single-source supplier for which we currently have no alternative source of supply. However, we maintain stored supplies of this adjuvant in quantities believed to be sufficient to meet our expected manufacturing needs. We also utilize single-source suppliers for other raw materials in our manufacturing processes.
We utilize single source suppliers for all components of NARCAN Nasal Spray. It is manufactured by a third party, which operates a full service offering from formulation to final packaging. Materials for production of NARCAN Nasal Spray, such as the naloxone active pharmaceutical ingredient and other excipients, along with the vial, stopper and device are produced around the world by other third parties and delivered to the primary manufacturer and released to manufacturing following appropriate testing.
We rely on single source suppliers for our plasma collection to support the Anthrasil, VIGIV and BAT programs. We work closely with our suppliers for these specialty programs and operate under long-term agreements. We order quantities of material in advance in quantities believed to be sufficient to meet upcoming demand requirements.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We actively seek to protect intellectual property related to our assets, including patent rights, trademark rights, trade secrets and proprietary confidential information, through defense and enforcement of existing rights and pursuit of protection on new and arising innovations. The duration of and the type of protection for patent rights depends upon many factors including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions or administrative term adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patents. We are a party to various license agreements, including those under which we license patents, patent applications, trademarks, materials and other intellectual property rights. It is our policy to ethically consider the enforcement and defense of our intellectual property rights, and to respect the intellectual property rights of others.
REGULATION
Regulations in the U.S. and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
Government Contracting
Our status as a USG contractor means that we are subject to various statutes and regulations, including:
•the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;
•the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations ("DFARs") and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of DoD government contracts;
•the Department of State Acquisition Regulation which regulates the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor;
•business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
•export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations and International Traffic in Arms Regulations; and
•laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
USG agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. Our role and status as a large government supplier to HHS, particularly BARDA increases the likelihood of Congressional review and oversight. The legal framework we are subject to as a government contractor imposes stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various laws, our government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience, detailed auditing and accounting systems requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes. 
The Project BioShield Act of 2004. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (Project BioShield) was enacted to augment market incentives for companies pursuing the development of MCMs of which the government is the only significant market. Project BioShield provided $5.6 billion over 10 years to develop, purchase, and stockpile MCMs for use in a public health emergency against CBRNE agents.
The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 and Reauthorization Acts. The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 established the role of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response ("ASPR") within HHS and provided statutory authorities for a number of programs, including the creation of BARDA to support the development and procurement of MCMs to respond to CBRNE. The Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 ("PAHPRA") continued BARDA’s role and reauthorized Project BioShield funding through fiscal year 2018 and provided BARDA with additional appropriations to support advanced research and development. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 reauthorized Project BioShield’s special reserve fund and authorized 10-year funding for product development. BARDA has used the incentives under Project BioShield and subsequent reauthorizations of it to build a robust pipeline of MCMs for multiple CBRNE agents. It has also procured and stockpiled many of our related products for potential use in the event of a PHT emergency, including BioThrax, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT, VIGIV and raxibacumab products.
Funding for BARDA is provided by annual appropriations by Congress. Congress appropriates annual funding for procurement of MCMs for the SNS (currently managed by ASPR) and for the NIAID to conduct biodefense research. This appropriation funding supplements amounts available under Project BioShield.
Emergency Use Authorization
Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act ("FDCA") authorizes FDA to issue EUAs to permit the introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved MCMs, or approved MCMs for unapproved uses, in the context of certain potential or actual public health emergencies. Several actions are required to trigger FDA’s authority to issue EUAs. First, there must be a determination by certain federal officials that a particular threat or emergency exists. This can be (1) a determination by the Secretary of HHS that there is a public health emergency, or a significant potential for a public health emergency, that affects, or has a significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves CBRN agents; (2) a determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security (“DHS”) that there is a domestic emergency, or a significant potential for a domestic emergency, involving a heightened risk of attack with a CBRN agent; (3) a determination by the Secretary of Defense that there is a military emergency, or a significant potential for a military emergency, involving a heightened risk to United States military forces from a CBRN agent; or (4) the identification of a material threat pursuant to section 319F–2 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad. Based on one of these determinations, the Secretary of HHS may make a declaration that circumstances exist justifying EUAs for MCMs to respond to the threat or emergency at issue. Once the relevant determination and declaration are issued, FDA has the authority to issue EUAs for the use of specific medical products based on criteria established by statute, including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions related to the threat or emergency and that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives to the issuance of an EUA. EUAs are subject to additional conditions and restrictions, are product-specific, and terminate when the EUA is revoked or the emergency determination or declaration underlying the EUA terminates.
Under PAHPRA, the USG may purchase certain MCMs for the SNS prior to FDA approval, licensure or authorization, under certain circumstances. BARDA is currently procuring AV7909, a product candidate that has not been approved or authorized by FDA under these authorities.
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ("PREP Act") creates liability immunity for manufacturers of MCMs when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration related to a specific disease, condition or public health threat. A PREP Act declaration is intended to provide liability immunity from claims under federal or state law for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration or use of a covered MCM. The only statutory exception to this immunity is for actions or failures to act that constitute willful misconduct. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations covering MCMs for smallpox, mpox, and other orthopox; anthrax; and botulinum toxin. These declarations could apply to BioThrax, ACAM2000, raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV products, as covered MCMs. The declarations for anthrax and botulism expire on December 31, 2027. The declaration for smallpox, mpox, and other orthopox expires on December 31, 2032. 
Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002. The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (“SAFETY Act”) was enacted to create certain liability limitations for Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technologies (“QATTs”) for claims arising out of, related to, or resulting from an act of terrorism. DHS administers the SAFETY Act program, which provides two potential categories of liability protections – designation and certification. If DHS deems an MCM a “Designated Technology,” then the company’s liability is limited to the amount of liability insurance that DHS determines the company must maintain. To receive “certification,” a QATT must first be “designated” and also be shown to perform as intended, conform to the manufacturer’s specifications, and be safe for use as intended. Certification allows the company to assert the Government Contractor defense for claims arising from acts of terrorism. 
DHS granted SAFETY Act designation and certification for BioThrax and RSDL in 2006 and has continued to renew those determinations. Any future renewals of the SAFETY Act designation and certification for BioThrax and RSDL products may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
Product Development for Therapeutics and Vaccines
Pre-Clinical Testing. We generally perform pre-clinical safety and efficacy testing on our product candidates before we initiate clinical trials.
Animal Rule. Conducting controlled human clinical trials to determine efficacy of MCMs against dangerous pathogens may sometimes be unethical or unfeasible. In such circumstances, products may be approved under the FDA’s “Animal Rule.” According to the FDA, this regulatory pathway can only be pursued if conducting human efficacy studies would be unethical and field trials to study the product’s effectiveness, after an accidental or deliberate exposure, are not feasible. Under the “Animal Rule,” under some circumstances, approval of product candidates can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy subjects that demonstrate adequate safety and immunogenicity and efficacy data from animal studies. These approvals generally are associated with a requirement for post-approval trials that would be conducted in the event of an act of bioterrorism, a pandemic, or other natural exposure to the pathogen at issue.
Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing and other available clinical data and manufacturing information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application. The data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies. The FDA may impose a full or partial clinical hold on the effectiveness of an IND pending receipt of additional information.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve administration of a product candidate to healthy human volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified physician under a regulatory agency approved protocol for the country in which the human trial is to be conducted. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in the following three sequential phases.
▪Phase 1 involves introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects and early evidence of effectiveness.
▪Phase 2 involves studies to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, explore tolerance, optimal dosage, and safety.
▪Phase 3 trials must assess clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of healthy subjects or patients, are intended to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product and provide adequate information for drug labeling. 
In addition, in certain circumstances Phase 4 studies may be conducted following marketing approval in order to provide additional data related to drug use. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that a clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects.
Good Clinical Practice. All phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting clinical trials.
Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines
Biologics License Application/New Drug Application. For large molecule products, such as vaccines, products derived from blood and blood components, and antibodies, all data obtained from a development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a BLA to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. For small molecule drugs, this information is submitted in a NDA filing. The submission of an application, either a BLA or an NDA, is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may issue a refuse to file, or RTF, letter to the applicant and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted. Most applications are subject to a substantial application fee and, if approved, will be assessed an annual fee. Under the FDCA, the FDA has the authority to grant waivers of certain user fees.
In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant approval, request more information or data, or decline to approve the application if, if among other potential deficiencies, the FDA determines that the application does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness, the drug is not safe for use under the conditions of use in the proposed labeling, or there are deficiencies in manufacturing quality. If the FDA decides not to approve an application, it will issue a complete response letter, or CRL. During the application, the FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure compliance with GCPs as well as the facility or facilities at which the candidate is manufactured to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMPs").
The receipt of regulatory approval may take many years, and typically involves the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval or significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, packaging, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on consumer advertising, which could negatively impact the commercial success of a product.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval under a full NDA for innovator products, or an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") for generic products. The Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (reference listed drugs, or RLDs). Because the safety and efficacy of RLDs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require ANDA applicants to independently demonstrate safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is required to demonstrate that its product contains the same active ingredient as, and is bioequivalent to, the innovator product, among other requirements. For a systemically absorbed drug, bioequivalence generally is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent of absorption of the generic product and the listed drug.
A third alternative for approval of a drug product is commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant might rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or submit other information to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for certain label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the applicant.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents for which the applicant has submitted information in connection with the NDA is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning each patent for which the RLD sponsor was required to submit information in connection with the RLD: (1) the patent information has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) has expired; (3) the date on which the patent will expire; or (4) the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as 
a paragraph IV certification. Alternatively, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may submit a statement that there are no relevant patents or that a method-of-use patent does not claim a proposed indication or other condition of use for which the applicant is seeking approval.
If the RLD’s NDA holder or patent owner initiates patent litigation to enforce an Orange Book-listed patent within 45 days after receiving notice of a paragraph IV certification, the FDA generally is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of receipt of the paragraph IV notice, although this stay may terminate earlier depending upon the resolution of the litigation, if the court issues an order terminating the stay, or if the patent owner or exclusive patent licensee consents to approval of the application before the expiration of the stay. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired. 
Biosimilar Products. When a biological product is licensed for marketing by FDA through the approval of a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHSA, the product may be entitled to exclusivity barring FDA from accepting or approving an application under section 351(k) of the PHSA for a competing products for certain periods of time. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the "BPCIA") added Section 351(k) of the PHSA, which provides an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA may approve a biosimilar product if it finds that the product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve an interchangeable biosimilar product, it must conclude that the product is biosimilar to the reference product, can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and—for a product that is administered more than once to an individual—alternating or switching between the proposed interchangeable product and the reference product would not create an increased risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy compared to using the reference product only.
FDA will not accept a biosimilar application until four years after the date of first licensure of a biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHSA, and FDA will not approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after such date of first licensure. This type of exclusivity is known as reference product exclusivity. The approval of a supplemental BLA or certain subsequent BLAs does not give rise to a new date of first licensure, and, consequently, does not yield an additional period of reference product exclusivity. from the date of first licensure of a biological product approved under section 351(a), Moreover, reference product exclusivity does not affect the timing of FDA’s acceptance or approval of a competing sponsor’s section 351(a) BLA containing the sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of its product. There have been recent legislative proposals to reduce the duration of the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. Moreover, many states have enacted laws that address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug, biologic or medical device product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events, providing FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, restrictions on advertising and promotion, and FDA inspections. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. The FDA may also require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes.
Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to be registered with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
A company that is found to have improperly promoted unapproved or off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under both the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act.
Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug" in the U.S. if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. or there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug and making it available in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States. A manufacturer must request orphan drug designation prior to submitting a BLA or NDA. Products designated as orphan drugs may be eligible for special grant funding for R&D, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, 
an exemption from the application fee for marketing applications and a seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity after marketing approval. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved.
Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug for a particular rare disease or condition) generally prevents FDA approval of another sponsor’s application for the same drug or for the same rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of the same product marketed by a different manufacturer under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care.
Vaccine and Therapeutic Product Lot Protocol. Because the manufacturing process for biological products is complex, the FDA requires for many biologics, including most vaccines and immune globulin products, that each product lot undergo thorough testing for purity, potency, identity and sterility. FDA may request samples of any lot and, when deemed necessary for the safety, purity, and potency of the product, FDA may prohibit us from distributing a lot until FDA releases the lot. Several of our vaccines are subject to lot release protocols by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.
Marketing Approval – Devices
Devices may be marketed as stand-alone devices or as constituent parts of a Combination Product, such as a device for delivery of a drug product. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”) or issuance of a de novo classification order. 
Medical devices are classified into one of three classes -- Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk and the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device. Medical devices deemed to pose lower risks are generally placed in either Class I or II. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining life-supporting or many implantable devices, or devices that have been found not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or Class II predicate device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA.
All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of study review and approval, informed consent, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. All clinical device studies, including non-significant risk studies, must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the study and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study.
Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations, including, for example, establishment registration and device listing; compliance with the requirements of the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”); compliance with requirements regarding the labeling and marketing of devices; medical device reporting regulations; correction and removal reporting regulations; compliance with requirements for Unique Device Identification (“UDI”); and post-market surveillance activities and requirements. 
Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reports of adverse events, labeling and other information to ensure compliance with the QSR and other applicable requirements, and to identify potential problems with manufacturing processes and marketed medical devices.
A combination product is a product comprised of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and device) that are combined into a single product, co-packaged, or sold separately but intended for co-administration, as evidenced by the labeling for the products (cross-labeling). Like their constituent parts—e.g., drugs and devices—combination products are highly regulated and subject to a broad range of pre- and post-market requirements including premarket review, cGMPs, or QSRs, adverse event reporting, periodic reports, labeling and advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions, market withdrawal and recall. Combination products are typically reviewed through a marketing submission that corresponds to the constituent part which provides the primary mode of action (“PMOA”) for the combination product. For 
example, if the PMOA of a device-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic, the agency center that reviews biologics would have the primary jurisdiction for the review.
The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices from the U.S., and medical devices that have not received FDA approval, or clearance or are exempt from premarket review requirements, are subject to FDA export requirements.
Manufacturing Requirements
The FDA's regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization and personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned and salvaged products. The manufacturing processes for devices must likewise be performed in compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, which covers the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of cleared, approved, or otherwise authorized products are required to register their establishments with the FDA, and in some instances state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements.
Inspections must follow a "risk-based schedule" that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Likewise, FDA’s regulations require clearance of a new 510(k) premarket notification for modifications to 510(k) cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, and approval of a PMA supplement for certain modifications to PMA-approved devices that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. The FDA's regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or failures to follow the QSR and the maintenance of applicable documentation by the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved, cleared, or otherwise authorized product.
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the U.S. and Canada as well as certain other countries. In the EU, medicinal products are authorized following a process that is similarly demanding as the process required in the U.S. Drug products may be authorized in one of two ways, either through the mutual recognition/decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the EU Member States or through the centralized procedure, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Each foreign country has its own regulatory requirements to medical devices. Before a medical device can be placed on the market in the EU compliance with the requirements of the Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 must be demonstrated in order to affix the CE Mark to the product. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the U.S. (e.g., good manufacturing practices).
As of January 1, 2021, the UK is no longer part of the EU following “Brexit”. All existing EU law in force on December 31, 2020 has been retained in UK law, subject to certain revisions that have become necessary as a result of Brexit. Thus, at least initially, the UK and the EU laws were aligned. Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules governing medicines and medical devices under the Northern Ireland Protocol. However, EU laws that took effect after January 1, 2021, including the EU Medical Devices Regulation, are not effective in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales, and the national laws applicable in Great Britain may further diverge from EU law in the future.
Potential Sanctions
For all FDA-regulated products, if the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or that a product is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, including but not limited to:
•restrictions on products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;
•restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;
•restrictions on distribution or use of a product;
•requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;
•warning letters or untitled letters;
•withdrawal of the products from the market;
•refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that are submitted;
•recall of products;
•fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;
•suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;
•refusal to permit the import or export of our products;
•product seizure; and
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Health regulatory authorities in other countries have similar rules and regulations although the specifics vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Fraud, Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws
The U.S. and most other jurisdictions have detailed requirements that apply to government and private health care programs, and a broad range of fraud and abuse laws, transparency laws, and other laws. Relevant U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
•The False Claims Act;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ("HITECH") Act;
•The price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992;
•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program; and
•Analogous and similar state laws and regulations.
Our operations are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") which prohibits corporations and individuals from corruptly paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or party official, or political candidate, directly or indirectly, in an attempt to influence a person working in an official capacity or otherwise obtain an improper advantage. We also may be impacted under the FCPA by the activities of our distributors, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors, consultants, agents, or other business partners. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries. 
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil penalties.
Regulations Governing Reimbursement
The marketing practices of U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws related to government funded healthcare programs.
In the U.S., certain of our products are reimbursed under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and or state pharmaceutical assistance programs. Many foreign countries have similar laws.
Various U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally funded health care programs, including federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and anti-self-referral laws, which may apply to federal and state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil penalties.
Additionally, drug pricing is an active area for regulatory reform at the federal and state levels, and significant changes to current drug pricing and reimbursement structures in the U.S. continue to be considered and enacted. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), was signed into law on August 16, 2022. As written, the IRA will, among other provisions, give HHS the ability and authority to directly negotiate with manufacturers the price that Medicare will pay for certain single-source drugs that account for the highest total Medicare spending. The IRA will also require manufacturers of certain Part B and Part D drugs to issue to HHS rebates based on certain calculations and triggers (i.e., when drug prices increase and outpace the rate of inflation). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is in the process of implementing a Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, and this program may affect future Medicare reimbursement for certain of our products.
Data Privacy Laws
A number of states in the U.S. have passed or introduced bills, which, if passed, impose operational requirements on U.S. companies similar to the requirements reflected in the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in the EU. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), which came into effect on January 1, 2020, requires covered companies that process personal information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private right of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorney generals are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The compliance and other burdens imposed by the EU's GDPR, CCPA and similar privacy laws and regulations may be substantial as they are subject to differing interpretations and implementation among jurisdictions. The restrictions imposed by such laws may require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional compliance costs and burdens.
Other Industry Regulation
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We value our employees and the contributions each of them makes to achieving our mission to protect and enhance life. We are committed to working together toward our long-term aspiration to protect and enhance one billion lives by 2030. We strive to create an environment that is professionally and personally rewarding by offering challenging work and projects for individual and team contribution, and opportunities for professional and personal development. Ongoing investments in employee engagement and leadership development remain essential to building the capabilities needed to realize our business strategy. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,500 employees.
In January 2023, we announced an organizational restructuring as part of our sharpened strategic focus, which resulted in the elimination of 132 roles. In February 2023, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our travel health business to Bavarian Nordic and approximately 280 employees are expected to join Bavarian Nordic as part of the transaction.
Health and Wellness
Employee health and well-being remain a priority of acute importance to our company. As 2022 progressed and regional health risks and safety requirements changed, we continued to adjust our approach to ensure that operation-critical development and manufacturing employees working on-site had access to appropriate personal protective equipment, enhanced facility procedures, and other resources. Additionally, we transitioned many employees who had been working remotely back into our facilities in a full-time or part-time manner to support business priorities. Other employees 
maintain a full-time remote work status and we continue to equip them with productivity and collaboration tools and resources.
Hiring and Talent Management 
We focus on building leaders at every level with the requisite scientific, technical and professional skills to develop and deliver products and services that protect life. We have consistent talent processes and systems across the company including performance management, training and development and succession planning. We recognize the need for ongoing skill enhancement and support continued learning through on-the-job assignments, training programs, tuition assistance professional memberships and professional conference attendance. We use the Gallup Q12 instrument to measure employee engagement and inclusion and administer “pulse surveys” throughout the year to gather feedback on matters of interest and importance to our employees and our business.
Compensation and Benefits
Our total rewards plan consists of competitive salaries, bonuses, and for employees in eligible roles, equity awards based on company, group and individual performance. We focus on results and behavior because we value how we do things as much as getting them done. This approach is core to our pay-for-performance philosophy. We continue to provide employees access to country-specific salary range information so that they may have greater visibility to their current compensation levels and more context as they explore developing their careers through new roles within our company. In our industry ongoing skill enhancement is essential and we continue to support continuous learning through on-the-job assignments, training programs, tuition assistance, professional memberships and professional conference attendance.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Commitment 
Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") is integral to how we operate and our success. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent reflecting a diversity of ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives. DEI fuels our business growth, drives innovation in the products and services we develop, in the way we solve problems, and how we serve the needs of a global and diverse patient, customer and partner base. We recognize the value that diversity contributes to our global organization and the competitive advantage we can maintain by cultivating a culture of inclusion to benefit from our broad range of talents, perspectives, and ideas. We demonstrate respect for the individual by providing fair and equal treatment to all our employees and continuously identifying ways to recognize their various needs and interests. One example of our commitment is demonstrated by our first three inaugural Emergent Resource Groups ("ERGs") for black, women and veteran employees. While aligned by constituency, our ERGs are open to all employees and are another way we will look to catalyze a sense of belonging and connection to the organization. These groups open pathways of communication, help to expand learning opportunities, and offer avenues to advance our business strategy.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
Our mission to protect and enhance life has motivated us to explore our impact at a broader scale — environmental, social and governance ("ESG") stewardship, corporate responsibility, and ethics. Our approach to these issues is the foundation of good governance and strengthens accountability in all aspects of our business activities and relationships. Our ESG efforts are led by a cross-functional working group, overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, guided by our Internal Executive Steering Committee, and under the responsibility of the Vice President, Assistant Treasurer reporting into the Chief Financial Officer. 
Each year, we assess our ESG priority areas and develop action items to advance progress in these areas. These areas include access to medicine, community engagement, compliance, corporate governance, diversity, equity and inclusion, employee engagement, environmental, health and employee safety, governmental relationship, innovation, manufacturing and product quality, patient and drug safety, scientific integrity, and supply chain management. Our strategy is influenced by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures framework as well as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s standards focused on the healthcare, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries. The annual ESG Report can be found at: www.emergentbiosolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2021-Emergent-ESG-Report.pdf. The information contained in the ESG report is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our ESG strategy is influenced by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") framework as well as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s ("SASB") standards focused on the healthcare, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries. The SASB standards provide guidelines on key sustainability issues that directly impact the operational performance and financial condition of our company.
Strengthening our culture and the quality of products and services we offer is an ongoing endeavor. Open and transparent communication with employees, customers, government officials, and community partners is vital to our success.
ESG Priority Issues
Each year, we will conduct an assessment of these priorities and develop action items to advance progress in these areas. Our board will provide oversight and governance over the implementation and disclosures relating to our ESG strategy:
•Access to Medicine
•Community Engagement
•Compliance
•Corporate Governance
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
•Employee Engagement
•Environmental, Health and Employee Safety
•Governmental Relationships
•Innovation
•Manufacturing and Product Quality
•Patient and Drug Safety
•Scientific Integrity
•Supply Chain Management
Sustainability and Environmental Management
We recognize that our operations have an impact on our local and global communities from the waste we generate, the energy we source, and the water we discharge. Environmental sustainability is a central consideration when improving and innovating our operational infrastructure across our enterprise and we must do out part to reverse the impacts of climate change which threaten environmental and human health. 
We evaluate ESG risks and opportunities related to climate change through the framework that the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") recommends: (i) governance, (ii) strategy, and (iii) risk management. As we further develop our environmental sustainability strategies, we intend to collect data on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our material operations. Doing so will enable Emergent to establish an energy baseline and prioritize future footprint reductions. 
This will also allow us to make informed decisions on setting targets and creating an accompanying strategy and road map for meeting our goals. In congruence, Emergent will determine the relevance of disclosure related to the quantifiable financial impact to our company under various global warming scenarios in line with TCFD recommendations.
Board Committee Oversight
The primary oversight of ESG issues is delegated to the Audit Committee, with active involvement and participation in the oversight activities from both the Compensation and the Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. Our management provides regular updates on ESG initiatives and progress at both the committee and full board meetings. Each director serves on at lease one committee. The composition of the committees, biographies of our directors, and other relevant corporate governance information are available on the investor section of our website under “Governance.” In addition, we also provide detailed corporate governance information, disclosures, and data in our annual proxy statement.
