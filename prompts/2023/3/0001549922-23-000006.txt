ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Summit Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, “SMLP”, or “the Partnership”), is a value-driven limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States. Our common units are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SMLP.”
The Partnership was formed in May 2012. The Partnership’s executive offices are located at 910 Louisiana Street, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002, and can be reached by phone at 832-413-4770. The Partnership also maintains regional field offices in close proximity to our areas of operation to support the operation and development of our midstream assets.
Our Business Strategies
We operate a differentiated midstream platform that is built for long-term, sustainable value creation. Our integrated assets are strategically located in production basins including the Williston Basin, DJ Basin, Utica Shale, Marcellus Shale, Barnett Shale, Piceance Basin and Permian Basin. Our primary business objective is to maximize cash flow and provide cash flow stability for our stakeholders while growing prudently and profitably. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:
•Capital structure optimization. We seek to maximize unitholder value. Our capital structure currently consists of common equity, preferred equity, and indebtedness that is comprised of debt securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, a portion of which is secured by substantially all of the Partnership's assets. We intend to optimize our capital structure in the future by reducing our indebtedness with free cash flow, and when appropriate, we may pursue opportunistic capital markets transactions with the objective of increasing long-term unitholder value.
•Portfolio management. We seek to maximize unitholder value by strategically managing our portfolio of midstream assets and allocating capital based on appropriate risk-informed cash flow assumptions. This may include opportunistic divestitures, re-allocation of capital to new or existing areas, and development of joint ventures involving our existing midstream assets or new investment opportunities.
•Maintaining our focus on fee-based revenue with minimal direct commodity price exposure. We intend to maintain our focus on providing midstream services under primarily long-term and fee-based contracts. We believe that our focus on fee-based revenues with minimal direct commodity price exposure is essential to maintaining stable cash flows.
•Maintaining strong producer relationships to maximize utilization of all of our midstream assets. We have cultivated strong producer relationships by focusing on customer service and reliable project execution and by operating our assets safely and reliably over time. We believe that our strong producer relationships will create future opportunities to expand our midstream services reach and optimize the utilization of our midstream assets for our customers.
•Continuing to prioritize safe and reliable operations. We believe that providing safe, reliable and efficient operations is a key component of our business strategy. We place a strong emphasis on employee training, operational procedures and enterprise technology, and we intend to continue promoting a high standard with respect to the efficiency of our operations and the safety of all of our constituents.
Recent Developments and Highlights
The following is a brief listing of significant developments and highlights for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additional information regarding these items may be found elsewhere in this Annual Report.
•Simultaneously completed the strategic 2022 DJ Acquisitions for $305.0 million. In December 2022, we acquired Outrigger DJ for cash consideration of $165.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, and Sterling DJ for cash consideration of $140.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. These acquisitions were a strategic step in our overall corporate strategy to establish a franchise position in the DJ Basin and expand our footprint for the benefit of our customers. The 2022 DJ Acquisitions significantly increased our gas processing capacity in the DJ Basin and diversified our customer base with a combination of long-term fixed fee and percentage-of-proceeds contracts. We funded these acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the credit facility and the issuance of $85.0 million of Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due in 2026.

•Portfolio optimization – Permian Midstream Divestiture. In June 2022, we completed the disposition of all the equity interests in Summit Permian, which owns the Lane Gathering and Processing System (“Lane G&P System”), and Permian Finance to Longwood Gathering and Disposal Systems, LP (“Longwood”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Matador ͏Resources Company (“Matador”), for cash consideration of $75.0 million. In connection with the transaction, we released, to a subsidiary of Matador, and Matador agreed to assume, take or-pay firm capacity on the Double E Pipeline.
•Portfolio optimization – Bison Midstream Divestiture. In September 2022, we completed the sale of Bison Midstream, LLC (“Bison Midstream”) and its gas gathering system in Burke and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota to a subsidiary of Steel Reef Infrastructure Corp. (“Steel Reef”) for cash consideration of $40.0 million.
•Issued inaugural Environmental, Social and Governance Report (“ESG Report”). In June 2022, we published our initial ESG Report. The report showcases our commitment to core principles that drive operational excellence, sustainability and value for our business. These principles include prioritizing safe and reliable operations, minimizing our environmental impact, protecting our employees’ health and wellbeing, and following responsible and ethical business practices. The ESG Report can be found at www.summitmidstream.com/esg but is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our Midstream Assets
Our midstream assets primarily gather natural gas produced from pad sites, wells and central receipt points connected to our systems. Gathered natural gas volumes are then compressed, dehydrated, treated and/or processed for delivery to downstream pipelines serving processing plants or end users. We also contract with producers to gather crude oil and produced water from wells connected to our systems for delivery to downstream pipelines and to third-party rail terminals in the case of crude oil and to third-party disposal wells in the case of produced water. We generally refer to most of the services our systems provide as gathering services. We also provide natural gas transmission services via Double E, a long-haul natural gas pipeline in which we indirectly own a 70% equity interest and serve as the pipeline’s operator. Double E provides natural gas transportation services from multiple receipt points in the Permian Basin to various delivery points in and around the Waha hub in Texas.
Reportable Segments. As of December 31, 2022, our reportable segments are below along with management’s categorization of the primary commodity driving customer drilling and completion decisions for each segment:
Oil price driven. Our cash flows in the Rockies and Permian segments are primarily influenced by the prevailing price of crude oil because the drilling and completion decisions by our customers in these segments are based on well economics most heavily tied to crude oil prices. Our customers’ decisions to drill and complete wells in these segments therefore result in higher volume throughput and cash flows for our midstream assets in which we collect fixed fees for gathering or processing hydrocarbons, gathering produced water, or transporting residue natural gas. 
•Rockies – Includes our wholly owned midstream assets located in the Williston Basin and the DJ Basin. 
•Permian – Includes our equity method investment in Double E. 
Natural gas price driven. Our cash flows in the Northeast, Piceance and Barnett segments are primarily influenced by the prevailing price of natural gas because the drilling, completion and recompletion decisions by our customers in these segments are based on well economics most heavily tied to natural gas and NGL prices. Our customers’ decisions to drill, complete or recomplete wells in these segments therefore result in higher throughput and cash flows for those segments in which we collect fixed fees for gathering natural gas. 
•Northeast – Includes our wholly owned midstream assets located in the Utica and Marcellus shale plays and our equity method investment in Ohio Gathering that is focused on the Utica Shale.
•Piceance – Includes our wholly owned midstream assets located in the Piceance Basin.
•Barnett – Includes our wholly owned midstream assets located in the Barnett Shale.
Industry Overview and Commercial Arrangements
We compete with other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, acreage dedications, service levels, access to end-use markets, geographic proximity of existing assets to a producer's acreage and available gathering and processing capacity. We may also face competition to gather production outside of our AMIs and attract producer volumes to our gathering systems.
We earn revenue by providing gathering, compression, treating and/or processing services pursuant to primarily long-term and fee-based gathering and processing agreements with some of the largest and most active producers in North America. Through 
Table of Contents

our equity method investment in the Double E Pipeline, we earn revenue by providing high pressure transportation services, as both firm and interruptible service, for residue natural gas in the Permian Basin. The fee-based nature of these agreements enhances the stability of our cash flows by limiting our direct commodity price exposure.
The significant features of our transportation and gathering and processing agreements, and the gathering and transportation systems to which they relate, are discussed in more detail below. For additional operating and financial performance information, on a consolidated basis and by reportable segment, see the "Results of Operations" section in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Areas of Mutual Interest. The vast majority of our gathering and processing agreements contain AMIs, some of which extend through 2039. The AMIs generally require that any production by our customers within the AMIs will be gathered and/or processed by our assets. In general, our customers have not leased acreage that cover our entire AMIs but, to the extent that they have leased acreage within our AMI, or lease additional acreage within our AMIs, any production from wells within that AMI will be dedicated to our systems.
Under certain of our gathering agreements, we have agreed to construct pipeline laterals to connect our gathering systems to producer pad sites located within the AMI. However, in certain circumstances we may choose not to pursue a pad connection opportunity presented by a customer if we believe that the investment would not meet our internal return expectations. Under this scenario, the customer may, in certain circumstances, construct the gathering infrastructure itself and sell it to us at a price equal to their cost plus an applicable profit margin, or, in some cases, we may release the relevant acreage dedication from the AMI. 
Our AMIs cover approximately 3.9 million surface acres in the aggregate, which includes more than 0.8 million surface acres associated with Ohio Gathering.
Minimum Volume Commitments. Certain of our gathering and/or processing agreements contain MVCs which, like AMIs, benefit from the development and ongoing operation of a gathering system because they provide a minimum contracted monthly or annual revenue stream. Some of our MVCs, including those of affiliates, extend through 2031. To the extent a customer does not meet its contractual MVC, it is obligated to make an MVC shortfall payment to us to cover the shortfall of required volume throughput not shipped or processed, either on a monthly or annual basis. We have designed our MVC provisions to ensure that we will generate a minimum amount of revenue from each customer over the life of the associated gathering and/or processing agreement, by either collecting gathering or processing fees on actual throughput or from cash payments to cover any MVC shortfall. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had remaining MVCs totaling 0.7 Tcfe, our MVCs had a weighted-average remaining life of 4.1 years, and these MVC's average approximately 408 MMcfe/d through 2027. 
For additional information on our MVCs, see Note 4 – Revenue and Note 8 – Deferred Revenue to the consolidated financial statements.
Throughput and Commodity Price Exposure. Our financial results are primarily driven by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. During 2022, aggregate natural gas volume throughput averaged 1,208 MMcf/d and crude oil and produced water volume throughput averaged 62 Mbbl/d. A majority of the volumes that we gather, compress, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure, which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk or volatility. We also earn a portion of our revenues from the following activities that directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices: (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds or other processing arrangements with certain of our customers in the Rockies, Permian and Piceance segments, (ii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain Barnett customers, (iii) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services in the Rockies and Piceance segments and (iv) additional gathering fees that are tied to performance of certain commodity price indexes, which are then added to the fixed gathering rates. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these additional activities accounted for approximately 18% of total revenues.
Equity Method Investment – Ohio Gathering. We have an equity method investment in Ohio Gathering, which comprises a natural gas gathering system and condensate stabilization facility located in the core of the Utica Shale in southeastern Ohio. Our joint venture partner in Ohio Gathering may elect to fund 100% of a capital call if we choose not to fund our proportionate share of such capital call. In 2022 and 2021, we chose to not fund capital calls in Ohio Gathering because the investment did not meet our corporate objectives and as a result, our ownership interest in that venture was reduced to 37.2% as of December 31, 2022 from 37.8% as of December 31, 2021. MPLX LP (“MPLX”) is the operator of the Ohio Gathering joint venture and our joint venture partner.
Equity Method Investment – Double E. We have an equity method investment in Double E, a 1.35 Bcf/d FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline that commenced operations in November 2021 and provides transportation service from multiple receipt points in the Delaware Basin to various delivery points in and around the Waha hub in Texas. We are the 
Table of Contents

operator of the joint venture and have made all required capital contributions to Double E. As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership owns a 70% interest in Double E. A subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation is our joint venture partner.

(2) Presented on a gross basis. As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately a 37.2% interest in OGC and approximately a 38.2% interest in OCC.
Our Northeast segment is comprised of our Summit Utica system, our Mountaineer Midstream system, and our equity method investments in Ohio Gathering.
Summit Utica system. The Summit Utica system is a natural gas gathering system located in Belmont and Monroe counties in southeastern Ohio and serves producers targeting the dry gas reserves of the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations. The Summit Utica system gathers and delivers natural gas, primarily under long-term, fee-based gathering agreements, which include acreage dedications. Ascent Resources is the key customer of Summit Utica, and the AMIs from our customers for this system cover approximately 115,000 surface acres in the aggregate.
We have connected a substantial number of our customers’ pad sites to our Summit Utica system and we expect to benefit from incremental volumes arising from drilling and completion activity that is occurring and will continue to occur on new and previously connected pad sites in our service area. Over time, we intend to expand our midstream service offerings for the Summit Utica system to connect additional customer pad sites and install centralized compression facilities. Centralized compression services have been dedicated to us in our gathering agreements and will eventually constitute a new revenue stream from our customers; however, to date, this service has not been required given the relatively high downhole pressures exhibited by dry gas wells in the Utica Shale compared to other unconventional shale plays.
The Summit Utica system interconnects with the Ohio River System pipeline, which provides access to the Clarington Hub and Rover Pipeline. 
Mountaineer Midstream system. The Mountaineer Midstream system, within the Marcellus shale, is located in Doddridge and Harrison counties in West Virginia where it gathers natural gas under a long-term, fee-based contract with Antero Resources Corporation (“Antero”), which is targeting liquids-rich natural gas production from the Marcellus shale in the Appalachian Basin. Volume throughput on the Mountaineer Midstream system is underpinned by minimum revenue commitments from Antero.
The Mountaineer Midstream system consists of a high-pressure natural gas gathering system and two compressor stations. This system gathers high-pressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with Antero Midstream. Mountaineer Midstream serves as a critical inlet to the Sherwood Processing Complex, a primary destination for liquids-rich natural gas in northern West Virginia and one of the largest natural gas processing facilities in the United States.
Ohio Gathering. Ohio Gathering comprises a natural gas gathering system and condensate stabilization facility located in the core of the Utica Shale in southeastern Ohio. The gathering system spans the condensate, liquids-rich and dry gas windows of the Utica Shale for multiple producers that are targeting production from the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations across Belmont, Monroe, Guernsey, Harrison and Noble counties in southeastern Ohio. Ohio Gathering is operated by our partner, MPLX. Substantially all gathering services on the Ohio Gathering system are provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based gathering agreements. Ascent Resources and Gulfport Energy Corporation are Ohio Gathering's key customers and the AMIs from our customers for this system cover approximately 830,000 surface acres in the aggregate.
Condensate and liquids-rich natural gas production is gathered, compressed, dehydrated and delivered to the Cadiz and Seneca processing complexes, which offer approximately 1.3 Bcf/d of processing capacity and are owned by a joint venture between MPLX and The Energy and Minerals Group. Dry gas production is gathered, dehydrated, compressed, and delivered to third-party pipelines serving the northeast and midwest markets.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately a 37.2% interest in OGC and approximately a 38.2% interest in OCC. For additional information, see Note 7 - Equity Method Investments to the consolidated financial statements.

Our Rockies reportable segment is comprised of our Polar and Divide system and the Niobrara G&P system.
Polar and Divide system. The Polar and Divide system, collectively Polar Midstream and Epping, which is located primarily in Williams and Divide counties in northwestern North Dakota, owns, operates and is currently developing crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines serving multiple customers that are targeting crude oil production from the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations. The Polar and Divide system is underpinned by long-term, fee-based gathering agreements, which include acreage dedications and MVCs. Chord Energy Corporation (formerly Whiting Petroleum Corporation), Zavanna LLC, Crescent Point Energy Corp, Enerplus Corporation and Kraken Resources are the key customers of the Polar and Divide system.
Crude oil that is gathered by the Polar and Divide system is delivered to interconnects with (i) the Dakota Access Pipeline, (ii) the COLT Hub rail facility, (iii) Enbridge Inc’s North Dakota Pipeline System and (iv) Global Partners LP's Basin Transload rail terminal. Produced water is delivered to third-party disposal facilities.
Niobrara G&P system. The Niobrara G&P system is located near Hereford, Colorado, in rural Weld, Morgan and Logan Counties, and in Cheyenne County of Nebraska. Weld County is the largest crude oil and natural gas producing county in Colorado. Gathering and processing services on the Niobrara G&P system are provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based and percentage of proceeds agreements with producers that are primarily targeting crude oil production from the Niobrara and Codell shale formations. Chevron Corporation, Civitas Resources, Inc., a large U.S. independent crude oil and natural gas company, Mallard Exploration (recently acquired by Bison Oil and Gas IV in January 2023), and Verdad Resources are the key customers of the Niobrara G&P system and have underpinned our volume throughput with acreage dedications and MVCs.
The Niobrara G&P system operates a low-pressure associated natural gas gathering system, and natural gas processing plants with processing capacity of up to 220 MMcf/d. 
Residue gas is delivered to the Cheyenne Plains, Colorado Interstate Gas, Trailblazer Pipeline and Southern Star and processed NGLs are delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline and the P66 NGL System.
Additionally, the system has discrete freshwater infrastructure that consists of 19 water wells and other infrastructure to provide its customers with up to approximately 55,000 barrels per day of fresh water for well completion activities, and the system includes approximately 30 miles of crude oil gathering pipeline with delivery into the Pony Express pipeline.

Our Barnett reportable segment is comprised of DFW Midstream system. 
DFW Midstream system. The DFW Midstream system is primarily located in southeastern Tarrant County, in north-central Texas. We consider this area to be the core of the Barnett Shale because of the quality of the geology and the high production profile of the wells drilled to date in our service area. The DFW Midstream system is underpinned by a long-term, fee-based gathering agreements with Total Gas & Power North America, Inc. (“Total”) and other customers. Total is the key customer for DFW Midstream.
The DFW Midstream system includes natural gas gathering pipelines located under both private and public property and is partially located along existing electric transmission corridors. Compression on the system is powered by electricity. To offset the costs we incur to operate the system's electric-drive compressors, we either pass through a portion of the power expense to our customers or retain and sell a fixed percentage of the natural gas that we gather.
The DFW Midstream system currently has five primary interconnections with third-party, primarily intrastate pipelines. These interconnections enable us to connect our customers, directly or indirectly, with the major natural gas market hubs in Texas and Louisiana.

Our Customers
The systems that we operate and/or have significant ownership interests in have a diverse group of customers and counterparties comprising affiliates and/or subsidiaries of some of the largest natural gas and crude oil producers in North America.
Regulation of the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Industries
General. Sales by producers of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are currently made at market prices. However, gathering and transportation services are subject to various types of regulation, which may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. FERC regulates the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and the interstate transportation of crude oil, petroleum products and NGLs. FERC regulation includes reviewing and accepting or approving rates and other terms and conditions for such transportation services and authorizing and regulating the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC is also authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in natural gas markets while the FTC is authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in petroleum markets and the CFTC is authorized to prevent and sanction fraud and price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. State and municipal regulations may apply to the production and gathering of certain natural gas, the construction and operation of natural gas and crude oil facilities and the rates and practices of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines.
Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Production and Sales. Sales of crude oil and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. FERC, which has the authority under the NGA to regulate the prices and other terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to its regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. Either Congress or FERC (with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce), however, could re-impose price controls in the future.
Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local regulation, including, but not limited to, permitting, well location, methods of drilling, well operations and conservation of resources. While these regulations do not directly apply to our business, they may affect our customers' ability to produce natural gas.
Regulation of the Gathering and Transportation of Natural Gas and Crude Oil. We believe that the majority of our natural gas pipeline facilities qualify as gathering facilities that are exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC. Our Double E Pipeline, which is an interstate natural gas pipeline located in New Mexico and Texas, and Epping Pipeline interstate crude oil pipeline, which is located in North Dakota and owned and operated by Epping, are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction and oversight pursuant to FERC's authority under the NGA and the ICA, respectively. Epping and Double E have tariffs on file with FERC.
In addition to approving and regulating the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines, FERC also regulates such pipelines’ rates and terms and conditions of service, including transportation service agreements and negotiated rate agreements.
Under FERC’s ICA jurisdiction, rates for interstate movements of liquids by pipeline are currently regulated primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their existing rates in accordance with a FERC-specified adjustment that sets a rate ceiling. This adjustment, which may be positive or negative in a given year, is subject to review every five years. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2021, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods minus 0.21%. FERC’s orders establishing this adjustment are subject to pending judicial review.
Under current FERC regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but a pipeline must establish that a substantial divergence exists between its actual costs and the rates resulting from the indexing methodology. 
The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit Epping’s ability to set rates based on costs or could order reduced rates and reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. The ICA also imposes potential criminal liability for certain violations of the statute.
FERC has jurisdiction over, among other things, the construction, ownership and commercial operation of pipelines and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the modification, extension, 
Table of Contents

enlargement, and abandonment of such facilities. FERC also has jurisdiction over the rates, charges, and term and conditions of service for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. With respect to transportation rates, FERC exercises its ratemaking authority by applying cost-of-service principles to limit the maximum and minimum levels of tariff-based recourse rates; however, it also allows for discounted or negotiated rates as an alternative to cost-based rates. In addition, FERC regulations also restrict interstate natural gas pipelines from sharing certain transportation or customer information with marketing affiliates and require that the transmission function personnel of interstate natural gas pipelines operate independently of the marketing function personnel of the pipeline or its affiliates. 
Pursuant to the NGA, existing interstate natural gas transportation and storage rates and terms and conditions of service may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by FERC. Additionally, rate changes and changes to terms and conditions of service proposed by a regulated natural gas interstate pipeline may be protested and such changes can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by FERC. FERC may also initiate reviews of an interstate pipeline’s rates. Double E currently holds authority from the FERC to charge and collect (i) “recourse rates,” which are the maximum cost-based rates an interstate natural gas pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff; (ii) “discount rates,” which are rates offered by the natural gas pipeline to shippers at discounts vis-à-vis the recourse rates and that fall within the cost-based maximum and minimum rate levels set forth in the natural gas pipeline's tariff; and (iii) “negotiated rates,” which are rates negotiated and agreed to by the pipeline and the shipper for the contract term that may fall within or outside of the cost-based maximum and minimum rate levels set forth in the tariff, and which are individually filed with the FERC for review and acceptance. On November 18, 2021, we entered into negotiated rate agreements with an average term of 10 years from the in-service date of the pipeline and with total MDTQ’s that increase from 585,000 Dth/d during the first year of the agreement to 1,000,000 Dth/d in the fourth year, which equates to approximately 74% of its certificated capacity of 1,350,000 Dth/d. When capacity is available and offered for sale, the rates (which include reservation, commodity, surcharges, and fixed fuel and lost and unaccounted for charges) and the terms and conditions at which such capacity is sold are subject to regulatory approval and oversight. Any successful challenge by a regulator or shipper in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Intrastate pipelines, which may include some pipelines that perform gathering functions, may be subject to safety regulation by the DOT, although typically state regulatory authorities (operating under a federal certification) perform this function. State regulatory authorities also have jurisdiction over the rates and practices of intrastate pipelines and gathering systems, including requirements for ratable takes or non-discriminatory access to pipeline services. The basis for state regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines varies from state to state. In Texas, we are regulated as a gas utility and have filed tariffs with the Railroad Commission of Texas to establish rates and terms of service for our DFW Midstream system assets. We have not been required to file tariffs in the other states in which we operate, although we are required to submit shape files and other information regarding the location and construction of underground gathering pipelines in North Dakota. The states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation that allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access issues and rate grievances, among other matters. State authorities in the states in which we operate generally have not initiated investigations of the rates or practices of gathering systems or intrastate pipelines in the absence of a complaint. State regulation of intrastate pipelines continues to evolve and may become more stringent in the future. For example, in 2016, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) adopted rule changes that resulted in additional construction and monitoring requirements for all pipelines, including, but not limited to, those that transport produced water. The NDIC has also adopted reclamation bonding requirements for certain underground gathering pipelines in North Dakota.
Natural gas, crude oil and produced water production, gathering and transportation, including the construction of new gathering facilities and expansion of existing gathering facilities may also be subject to local regulation, such as approval and permit requirements.
Statutory Compliance and Anti-Market Manipulation Rules. We are subject to the anti-market manipulation and penalty provisions in the NGA and the NGPA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which authorize FERC to impose fines of up to approximately $1.5 million per day per violation of the NGA, the NGPA, or their implementing rules, regulations, and orders subject to future adjustments for inflation. In addition, the FTC holds statutory authority under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to prevent market manipulation in petroleum markets, including the authority to request that a court impose fines of up to approximately $1.4 million per violation, subject to future adjustment for inflation. These agencies have promulgated broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and gas markets. The CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to statutory authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of approximately $1.4 million per day per violation, subject to future adjustment for inflation, or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation.

Safety and Maintenance. We are subject to regulation by the DOT, which establishes federal safety standards for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas and crude oil pipeline facilities. In the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, Congress expanded the DOT's regulatory authority to include regulated gathering lines that had previously been exempt from federal jurisdiction. Additional legislation has been passed over the years to reauthorize federal funding for federal pipeline programs, increase penalties for safety violations and establish additional safety requirements. For example, in December 2020, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 became law, reauthorizing PHMSA for funding through 2023 and requiring, among other things, rulemaking to amend the integrity management program, emergency response plan, operation and maintenance manual, and pressure control recordkeeping requirements for gas distribution operators; to create new leak detection and repair program obligations; and to set new minimum federal safety standards for onshore gas gathering lines.
The DOT has delegated the implementation of pipeline safety requirements to PHMSA, which has adopted and enforces safety standards and procedures applicable to a limited number of our pipelines. In addition, many states, including the states in which we operate, have adopted regulations that are identical to or more restrictive than existing PHMSA regulations for intrastate pipelines. Among the regulations applicable to us, PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for certain pipelines located in high consequence areas, which include high-population areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth greater metropolitan area where our DFW Midstream system is located. While the majority of our pipelines have historically met the DOT definition of gathering lines and were thus exempt from the integrity management requirements of PHMSA, we also operate a limited number of pipelines that are subject to the integrity management requirements. Those regulations require operators, including us, to:
•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
•identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;
•maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;
•repair and remediate pipelines as necessary;
•adopt and maintain procedures, standards and training programs for control room operations; and
•implement preventive and mitigating actions.
In addition, PHMSA has taken recent action to regulate gathering systems, which includes integrity management requirements. In November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that extended pipeline safety requirements to onshore gas gathering pipelines. The rule requires all onshore gas gathering pipeline operators to comply with PHMSA’s incident and annual reporting requirements. It also extends existing pipeline safety requirements to a new category of gas gathering pipelines, “Type C” lines, which generally include high-pressure pipelines that are larger than 8.625 inches in diameter. Safety requirements applicable to Type C lines vary based on pipeline diameter and potential failure consequences. The final rule became effective in May 2022 and operators were required to comply with the applicable safety requirements by November 2022.
PHMSA has also imposed additional requirements on onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines in recent years. In October 2019, the PHMSA issued three new final rules. One rule, which became effective in December 2019, establishes procedures to implement the expanded emergency order enforcement authority set forth in an October 2016 interim final rule. Among other things, this rule allows the PHMSA to issue an emergency order without advance notice or opportunity for a hearing. The other two rules, which became effective in July 2020, imposed several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The rule concerning gas transmission extended the requirement to conduct integrity assessments beyond “high consequence areas” (“HCAs”) to pipelines in “moderate consequence areas” (“MCAs”). It also included requirements to reconfirm Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure (“MAOP”), report MAOP exceedances, consider seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management, and use certain safety features on in-line inspection equipment. PHMSA modified the rule in July 2020, in response to a petition for reconsideration, to limit the rule’s recordkeeping requirement related to class location changes to gas transmission pipelines (not gas distribution pipelines) and to clarify that the rule’s reconfirmation requirements related to MAOP is limited to segments without traceable, verifiable and complete pressure test records. The rule concerning hazardous liquids extended the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity fed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events, and added a requirement to make all lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years. In addition, in August 2022, PHMSA issued a final rule that established new or additional requirements for natural gas transmission lines related to the management of change process, integrity management, corrosion control standards, and pipeline inspections and repairs.
Gathering systems like ours are also subject to a number of other federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of 
Table of Contents

workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
Environmental Matters
General. Our operation of pipelines and other assets for the gathering, treating, transportation and/or processing of natural gas and the gathering of crude oil and produced water is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these assets, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:
•requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;
•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;
•delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;
•requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and
•enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits or permit requirements issued pursuant to or imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more stringent requirements, resulting in more restrictions and limitations, on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing and future regulations.
The following is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hazardous Substances and Waste. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of solid and hazardous wastes and other substances, including hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. Furthermore, the Toxic Substances Control Act and analogous state laws, impose requirements on the use, storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances at our facilities. CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the RCRA and comparable state statutes. While the RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Although we generate minimal hazardous waste, it is possible that non-hazardous wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Moreover, from time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes.
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we believe that the previous operators utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other 
Table of Contents

locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal, without our knowledge. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our facilities, and also impose various monitoring, control and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and criminal enforcement actions. Furthermore, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air pollutant emitting sources.
In October 2015, the EPA issued a new lower NAAQS for ozone. The previous ozone standard was set at 75 parts per billion (“ppb”). The revised standard has been lowered to 70 ppb. The lowered ozone NAAQS could subject us to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements and increased permitting delays and costs.  In October 2022, EPA reclassified the Dallas Fort Worth area as severe nonattainment under the 75 ppb standard and moderate nonattainment under the 70 ppb standard. As part of the same action, EPA also reclassified portions of Weld County, Colorado as severe nonattainment under the 75 ppb standard. In July 2022, EPA notified the State of Texas that it was considering redesignating an area comprising several Texas and New Mexico counties in the Permian Basin as a new ozone nonattainment area. These reclassifications and redesignations in areas where we operate could result in additional fees and more stringent permitting requirements for our operations, among other things.  In addition, the EPA reviewed the 2015 70 ppb standard in 2020, but retained the standard without revision. However, EPA has announced that it will reconsider the 2020 decision to retain the 2015 standards. Future actions to lower the standard could similarly result in additional fees or more stringent permitting.
On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to its 2012 New Source Performance Standard (“NSPS”) OOOO for the oil and gas industry, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases - most notably methane - along with smog-forming VOCs. The revisions, which are published in the Federal Register under Subpart OOOOa, included the addition of methane to the pollutants covered by the rule, along with requirements for detecting and repairing leaks at gathering and boosting stations. Further, in November 2021, the EPA issued a new proposed rule targeting methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would: (1) update NSPS OOOOa; (2) adopt a new NSPS OOOOb for sources that commence construction, modification or reconstruction after the date the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register; and (3) adopt a new NSPS OOOOc to establish emissions guidelines, which will inform state plans to establish standards for existing sources. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to update and expand the proposed NSPS OOOOb and OOOOc rules. This supplemental proposal would impose more stringent requirements and include sources not previously regulated under this source category. If finalized, these increasingly stringent requirements, or the application of new requirements to existing facilities, could result in additional restrictions on operations and increased compliance costs for us or our customers.
On November 16, 2016 the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to reduce venting and flaring of natural gas on public and Indian lands. The final rule mirrored many of the requirements found in NSPS OOOOa, with additional natural gas royalty requirements for flared volumes at sites already connected to gas capture infrastructure. The rule was vacated by a Wyoming federal district judge in 2020. However, BLM proposed a new rule in November 2022, similarly designed to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian leases. While the rule, if finalized, is expected to have little or no direct impact on our operations, our customers that are primarily upstream wellhead operators may be impacted by the requirements in this rule.
In recent years, the EPA has also demonstrated an increased focus on CAA compliance for natural gas gathering operations. For example, in September 2019, EPA issued an enforcement alert noting that EPA identified CAA noncompliance caused by unauthorized and/or excess emissions from depressurizing pig launchers and receivers in natural gas gathering operations. The alert discussed engineering, design, operations, and maintenance practices that EPA found that can cause noncompliance and summarizes engineering solutions to reduce emissions. This increased focus on natural gas gathering operations and any resulting enforcement actions by the EPA or state agencies could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations.

Water Discharges. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, which impacts our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits require us to control storm water runoff from some of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. Except as otherwise disclosed in this annual report, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations relating to water discharges.
Oil Pollution Control Act. The OPA requires the preparation of an SPCC plan for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility's operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility's SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security and training. Certain of our facilities are classified as SPCC-regulated facilities. We believe that they are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of OPA.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations, and is primarily regulated by state agencies. A number of states – such as Colorado, as discussed above – have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on crude oil and/or natural gas drilling activities. For example, during the 2021-2022 election cycle, Colorado representatives proposed a ballot initiative to ban hydraulic fracturing on all non-federal land, but the proposed initiative failed to garner significant support.  States also could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as New York, Maryland, Oregon, and Vermont have done. In addition, certain local governments have adopted, and additional local governments may adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. These initiatives and similar efforts in Colorado and elsewhere could restrict oil and gas development in the future.
The EPA has also moved forward with various regulatory actions, including a proposal to issue new regulations under the NSPS to expand and strengthen emissions reduction requirements under NSPS OOOOa for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources, and require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. For further discussion of NSPS OOOOa and subsequent actions by the EPA, see the “Air Emissions” section above. The BLM has also asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process, and issued a final rule in March 2015 that established more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, including requirements relating to well construction and integrity, handling of wastewater and chemical disclosure. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rule. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California upheld the December 2017 rescission rule in a March 2020 decision, and the State of California and environmental plaintiffs appealed. The parties remain in settlement discussions.
Further, several federal governmental agencies (including the EPA) have conducted reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
State and federal regulatory agencies have also focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, and Texas, have modified their regulations or guidance to account for induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on our customers.
Additionally, certain of our customers produce oil and gas on federal lands. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Several states filed lawsuits challenging the suspension, and on June 15, 2021, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide temporary injunction blocking the suspension. Although the injunction was subsequently overturned by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on remand the US District Court issued a permanent injunction as requested by the plaintiff states in August 2022. The Department of the 
Table of Contents

Interior has since resumed leasing. However, the Biden Administration continues to evaluate federal leasing and could impose additional restrictions in the future.
If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted, this could result in a reduction in the supply of natural gas and/or crude oil that our customers produce, and could thereby adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Compliance with such rules could also generally result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for our customers, which could ultimately decrease end-user demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species.
National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. Major projects requiring federal permits or involving federal funding that have the potential to significantly impact the environment require review under NEPA. Many of our activities are covered under categorical exclusions which result in an expedited NEPA review process. Large upstream and downstream projects with significant cumulative impacts may be subject to longer NEPA review processes, which could impact the timing of those projects and our services associated with them.
Climate Change. The EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, establish GHG emission limits from motor vehicles as well as establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of GHG emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis.
EPA rules also require the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG-emitting sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems. We are required to report under these rules for our assets that have GHG emissions above the reporting thresholds. In October 2015, the EPA issued revisions to Subpart W of the GHG reporting rule to include reporting requirements for gathering and booster stations, onshore natural gas transmission pipelines, and completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. This development resulted in increased monitoring and reporting for our operations and for upstream producers for whom we provide midstream services. Further, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, includes a Methane Emissions Reduction Program to incentivize methane emission reductions and impose a fee on GHG emissions from certain oil and gas facilities.
In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. In general, the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Depending on the scope of a particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., at compressor stations). Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that certain components of our operations, such as our gas-fired compressors, could become subject to state-level GHG-related regulation.
Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after over 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement. In November 2019, the United States submitted formal notification to the United Nations that it intended to withdraw from the agreement. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America” that reversed the prior withdrawal, and the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. As part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced that the United States would commit to a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030 and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. In November 2021, the Biden Administration expanded on this commitment and announced “The Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050,” establishing a roadmap to net zero emissions in the United States by 2050 through, among other things, improvements in energy efficiency; decarbonization of energy sources via electricity, hydrogen, and sustainable biofuels; and reductions in non-CO2 GHG emissions, such as methane and nitrous oxide. These initiatives followed a series of executive orders by President Biden designed to address climate change. For example, the Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” called for new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that were identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. Reentry into the Paris Agreement, new legislation, or President Biden’s executive orders may result in the development of 
Table of Contents

additional regulations or changes to existing regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our customers.
Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products, and those of our customers, by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a variety of tax credits to incentivize the development and use of solar, wind, and other alternative energy sources while imposing several new requirements on oil and gas operators. Furthermore, a number of local governments across the country have banned or considered instituting bans on gas-fired appliances in newly constructed homes and other buildings, and federal agencies are considering more stringent safety or efficiency standards that could impact the availability of, access to or demand for gas-fired appliances. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG-emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. Conversely, to the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG-emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions.
