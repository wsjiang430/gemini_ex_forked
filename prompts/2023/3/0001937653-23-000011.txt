Overview
Zymeworks is a biotechnology company committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel, multifunctional biotherapeutics. Zymeworks’ mission is to make a meaningful difference for people impacted by difficult-to-treat cancers and other serious diseases. Zymeworks’ complementary therapeutic platforms and fully integrated drug development engine provide the flexibility and compatibility to precisely engineer and develop highly differentiated antibody-based therapeutic candidates.
Our lead product candidate, zanidatamab, is a novel bispecific antibody that targets two distinct domains of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”). Zanidatamab’s unique binding properties result in multiple mechanisms of action that may enable it to address unmet need in patient populations with HER2-expressing cancers. In clinical trials, zanidatamab monotherapy and zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy have been well tolerated with promising antitumor activity in patients with treatment-naive and heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers, including individuals whose disease had progressed on multiple prior treatment regimens that included HER2-targeted agents. Based on these data, a number of global multicenter clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate zanidatamab in specific indications and lines of therapy. These include pivotal clinical trials in (i) previously treated HER2 gene-amplified biliary tract cancers (“BTC”) and (ii) first-line locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (“GEA”) in combination with chemotherapy with or without BeiGene, Ltd.’s (“BeiGene”) tislelizumab. These also include proof of concept trials in (i) first-line locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive colorectal cancer (“CRC”), GEA, or BTC in combination with standard of care chemotherapy, (ii) first-line locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive GEA in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy, (iii) first-line locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in combination with docetaxel, (iv) previously treated locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in combination with Pfizer’s Ibrance (palbociclib) and fulvestrant, (v) previously treated locally advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing cancers (including HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer) in combination with ALX Oncology Inc.’s (“ALX Oncology”) evorpacept (ALX148), and (vi) locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic HER2-expressing cancers in Japanese patients. Zymeworks has entered into separate agreements with BeiGene and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited (a subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, collectively referred to as “Jazz”), granting each of BeiGene and Jazz with exclusive rights to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in different territories. Through these agreements, Zymeworks has no funding obligations for current or future clinical studies or research and development spending and retains rights to receive potential regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties for future net sales, pending approval in relevant regulatory jurisdictions. For additional information regarding these agreements with BeiGene and Jazz, see the section entitled “Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations” below.
Our second product candidate, zanidatamab zovodotin (formerly known as “ZW49”), combines the unique biparatopic antibody design of zanidatamab with our ZymeLink auristatin antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) technology, comprised of our proprietary cytotoxin (cancer cell-killing compound) and cleavable linker. We designed zanidatamab zovodotin to be a potential best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC to further address unmet need across a range of HER2-expressing cancers. In January 2023, we announced our intent to continue development of zanidatamab zovodotin at the recommended phase two dose (“RP2D”) of 2.5 mg/kg dosed every three weeks. Before the end of 2023, we expect to present additional data from our Phase 1 clinical trial that further supports this RP2D and commence enrollment in multiple Phase 2 studies. 
We are also advancing a deep pipeline of preclinical product candidates and discovery-stage programs in oncology (including immuno-oncology agents) and other therapeutic areas with an emphasis on developing ADC and multi-specific antibody therapeutics (“MSAT”) candidates. Our pipeline of preclinical product candidates includes two lead programs, ZW191 and ZW171, for which we expect to submit investigational new drug (“IND”) applications in 2024, as well as multiple early-stage preclinical programs in development. The two lead programs are as follows: 
•ZW191, our lead ADC candidate, is built using our Drug Conjugate platforms and uses our novel topoisomerase inhibitor (“TOPO1i”)-based payload technology targeting folate receptor alpha expressing ovarian, other gynecological, and non-small cell lung cancers. ZW191 was designed using an in-house generated monoclonal antibody with enhanced internalization characteristics in order to target high, mid, and low levels of folate alpha receptor expression; and
•ZW171, our lead multispecific candidate, is built using our Azymetric platform and is a novel 2 + 1 format T-cell engaging multispecific antibody targeting pancreatic, mesothelioma, ovarian, and other mesothelin (“MSLN”)-

expressing cancers. ZW171 has a unique geometry with two single-chain fragment variable arms targeting MSLN, and one fab arm targeting CD3 to redirect the body’s natural immune system to fight cancer cells.
Our proprietary capabilities and technologies include several modular, complementary therapeutic platforms that can be used in combination with each other and with existing approaches. This ability to layer technologies without compromising manufacturability enables us to engineer next-generation biotherapeutics with synergistic activity, which we believe will result in improved patient outcomes. Our platforms include:
•Azymetric, our multispecific antibody platform, which enables therapeutic antibodies to simultaneously bind multiple distinct locations on a target (known as an epitope) or to multiple targets. This is achieved by tailoring multiple configurations of the antibody’s Fab regions (locations on the antibody to which epitopes bind);
•Drug Conjugate Platforms, used to develop ADC candidates, are comprised of cytotoxins and the linker technologies used to couple these cytotoxins to tumor-targeting antibodies or proteins. These platforms can be used in conjunction with our other therapeutic platforms to increase safety and efficacy as compared to existing ADC technologies;
•EFECT, which enables finely tuned modulation (both up and down) of immune cell recruitment and function; and 
•ProTECT, which enables tumor-specific activity that may reduce systemic toxicity and simultaneously enhances localized immune co-stimulation or checkpoint modulation that may increase efficacy.
Our protein engineering expertise and proprietary structure-guided molecular modeling capabilities enable these therapeutic platforms. Together with our internal antibody discovery and generation technologies, we have established a fully integrated drug development engine and toolkit capable of rapidly delivering a steady pipeline of next-generation product candidates in oncology and other therapeutic areas.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to use our experience and capabilities developing multifunctional therapeutics platforms, along with our proprietary protein engineering capabilities, to have a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of people living with difficult-to-treat cancers and other serious diseases with high unmet medical need.
To achieve this goal, we are focused on delivering substantial progress across five key areas of our business: 
Zanidatamab Collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals
Our collaboration agreement with Jazz entered into during the fourth quarter of 2022 represents an important component of our commercialization strategy for zanidatamab and our financial strategy for expanding and developing our product pipeline. Through December 31, 2022, we have received $375 million in proceeds from the Jazz collaboration and are eligible for reimbursement of ongoing zanidatamab-related costs in accordance with the development plan and budget. We also remain eligible to receive regulatory approval milestones of up to $525 million, commercial milestones of up to $862.5 million, and royalties of between 10% and 20% of future zanidatamab sales, pending regulatory approval of zanidatamab. In conjunction with Jazz, we plan to provide updates on progress towards regulatory filings, new clinical studies, and future clinical data releases, which includes the anticipated presentation of the full data set from our HERIZON-BTC-01 pivotal clinical trial in the first half of 2023 and our expectation to report top-line data from our HERIZON-GEA-01 pivotal clinical trial in 2024. 
Zanidatamab Collaboration with BeiGene 
Our collaboration agreements with BeiGene in the key Asia Pacific (APAC) regions (excluding Japan) are important given the high prevalence of BTC and GEA in the APAC region. To date, we have received approximately $60 million in upfront and milestone payments from the BeiGene collaboration as well as certain co-development funding for zanidatamab clinical studies. Through our collaboration with BeiGene on zanidatamab and zanidatamab zovodotin, we remain eligible to receive up to $390 million in additional development and commercial milestones together with tiered royalties of up to 20% of future product sales, pending regulatory approval. In conjunction with BeiGene, we plan to provide updates on progress towards regulatory filings in the APAC region, new clinical studies, and future clinical data releases.
Research and Early Development Programs
Our current scientific strategy provides for a broad and differentiated product pipeline of ADCs and multispecific antibody therapeutics to be developed from our technology platforms with the goal of five new IND applications by 2027. We expect to submit IND applications for our lead preclinical product candidates (ZW191 and ZW171) in 2024. During 2023, we expect to 
Table of Contents

nominate an additional product candidate for preclinical development with an anticipated IND filing in 2025. We plan to continue actively presenting and publishing additional data on our preclinical programs in 2023, with a focus on the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) meeting scheduled for the second quarter. We expect to evaluate, and potentially enter into, additional multi-product collaborations and partnerships in 2023 and 2024 to expand the breadth of our research and early development programs. We plan to make additional investments during 2023 and 2024 in the size and capabilities of our research group in order to maintain the desired speed, quality, diversity, and novelty in our future product pipeline. Further, we also plan to evaluate external opportunities in adjacent research areas to expand our focus beyond the current technology platforms.
Zanidatamab Zovodotin
We plan to continue development of zanidatamab zovodotin at the RP2D of 2.5 mg/kg every three weeks and, before the end of 2023, we expect to present additional data from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical study that supports this RP2D. Based on the data generated to date from the Phase 1 clinical study, which has continued to enroll patients to gather additional data for zanidatamab zovodotin monotherapy, we plan to evaluate zanidatamab zovodotin as monotherapy and/or in combination with the current respective standards of care in multiple Phase 2 studies expected to commence enrollment in 2023. Based on our development efforts to date and in combination with the results of these planned clinical studies, we believe these results may provide the rationale for one or more registration-enabling studies of zanidatamab zovodotin before the end of 2025, which we would expect to undertake with a future collaboration partner.
Platform Licensing Portfolio
To date, we have received approximately $180.0 million in the form of non-refundable upfront and milestone payments from platform partnership and collaboration agreements, excluding amounts received related to zanidatamab or zanidatamab zovodotin. We continue to have revenue-generating strategic partnerships and collaborations with respect to our Azymetric, EFECT and Drug Conjugate therapeutic platforms with the following pharmaceutical companies: BeiGene, Celgene Corporation and Celgene Alpine Investment Co. LLC (now a Bristol-Myers Squibb company, “BMS”), GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited (“GSK”), Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (“Daiichi Sankyo”), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), LEO Pharma A/S (“LEO”), Iconic Therapeutics, Inc. (“Iconic”) (and through our relationship with Iconic, Exelixis, Inc. (“Exelixis”)), Merck Sharp & Dohme Research GmbH (“Merck”), and Atreca, Inc. (“Atreca”). During 2023 and 2024, we expect to earn additional milestone payments under certain of these agreements as products continue to advance in development, and we have the potential to receive additional payments in connection with any expansion or extension of these agreements. 
Product Candidate Pipeline
We currently have two lead product candidates in clinical development and several product candidates in preclinical development that leverage our multiple therapeutic platforms to address areas of significant unmet medical need. Our lead product candidates, zanidatamab and zanidatamab zovodotin, utilize the Azymetric platform to address patient populations with HER2-expressing cancers. We are also actively advancing a diverse set of preclinical programs, which leverage one or more of our proprietary therapeutic platforms to create a deep pipeline of well-differentiated product candidates for oncology and other therapeutic areas.
Late-Stage Clinical: Zanidatamab
Overview
Zanidatamab, our lead product candidate, is currently being evaluated in Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials, including certain ongoing pivotal clinical trials. It is a biparatopic antibody, based on our Azymetric platform, that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2. Zanidatamab’s unique binding properties result in multiple mechanisms of action including HER2‑receptor clustering, internalization, and downregulation; inhibition of growth factor-dependent and -independent tumor cell proliferation; antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis; and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. These combined mechanisms of action have led to promising antitumor activity in preclinical models of HER2-expressing cancers, including tumors resistant to trastuzumab (currently branded as Herceptin).
We have entered into separate agreements with BeiGene and Jazz, granting each of BeiGene and Jazz exclusive rights to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in different territories. Through these agreements, we have no funding obligations for current or future clinical studies or research and development spending and retain rights to receive potential regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties for future net sales, pending approval in relevant regulatory jurisdictions.

Clinical Development of Zanidatamab
In clinical trials, zanidatamab monotherapy and zanidatamab in combination have been well tolerated with promising antitumor activity in patients with treatment-naive and heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers, including individuals whose disease had progressed on multiple prior treatment regimens that included HER2-targeted agents. Based on these data, a number of global multicenter clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate zanidatamab in specific indications and lines of therapy, as described above under “Overview.” 
In June 2022, we, in conjunction with our Asia-Pacific partner BeiGene, presented Phase 1b/2 clinical data at the ASCO Annual Meeting. The two presentations included data on the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric/ gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma using zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy and BeiGene’s anti-PD1 tislelizumab and on the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received zanidatamab plus chemotherapy. In 33 response-evaluable patients with advanced HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with zanidatamab and tislelizumab in combination with the CAPOX chemotherapy regimen, the confirmed objective response rate (“cORR”) was 75.8% [95% CI: 57.7, 88.9]. The disease control rate (“DCR”) was 100% and duration of response ranged from 2.1+ to 18.2+ months. Twenty patients (61%) remained on study at the time of data cut-off. In 21 response-evaluable patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer treated with zanidatamab and docetaxel, the cORR was 90.5% [95% CI: 69.6, 98.8] with 15 patients (78.9%) having an ongoing response at the time of the data cut. The DCR was 95.2% [95% CI: 76.2, 99.9]. The median follow-up was 7.0 months (range 1.1-17.4 months) and the six-month progression-free survival rate was 95.2% [95% CI: 70.7, 99.3]. Overall, both combinations exhibited promising response rates and tolerability in patients. 
In December 2022, we published in The Lancet Oncology our Phase 1 data (NCT02892123) in pre-treated patients with HER2-expressing solid tumors who received zanidatamab monotherapy. Eighty-six patients (22 patients with BTC, 28 patients with CRC and 36 patients with other solid tumors excluding GEA or breast cancer) demonstrated promising responses and zanidatamab was generally well tolerated in patients. Grade 1-2 diarrhea and infusion reactions were the most common reported treatment-related adverse events with no treatment-related deaths. In addition, 31 [37%; 95% CI 27.0, 48.7] of 83 evaluable patients had a cORR.
In December 2022, we presented Phase 2 clinical data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The presentation reported data from a clinical study of 45 patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive, Hormone Receptor-positive (“HR-positive”) metastatic breast cancer who received zanidatamab in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant. Patients had received prior regimens containing HER2-targeted agents including trastuzumab (100%), pertuzumab (80%), T-DM1 (98%), and other available options. In 36 efficacy-evaluable patients, treatment with zanidatamab in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant resulted in a cORR of 33% [95% CI: 18.6, 51.0] and DCR of 92% [95% CI: 77.5, 98.2), and the majority of patients experienced a decrease in tumor size. The interim median progression-free survival (“mPFS”) was 9.6 months [95% CI: 7.2, 16.6] with seven patients still on study at the time of data cut-off (August 31, 2022). The regimen was generally well tolerated with expected rates of neutropenia, a known side effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors. The majority of patients with treatment-related adverse events experienced mild to moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2).
Also in December 2022, we announced positive top-line data in the HERIZON-BTC-01 pivotal Phase 2b trial of zanidatamab as monotherapy in previously treated HER2-amplified BTC patients. The top-line results showed that 41.3% [95% CI: 30.4, 52.8] of enrolled patients with HER2-amplified and expressing (IHC2+ and 3+) disease achieved a confirmed objective response as assessed by independent central review. The median duration of response was 12.9 months [95% CI: 5.95 to not reached]. The safety profile of zanidatamab in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported monotherapy studies, with no new safety signals identified. Full results from the pivotal trial are expected to be presented at a medical meeting in the first half of 2023.
In January 2023, we presented updated Phase 2 clinical data at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. The presentation included updated data from a clinical study evaluating zanidatamab in combination with standard of care chemotherapy in first-line HER2-expressing GEA patients. Patients had not received prior HER2-targeted agents or systemic treatment for metastatic GEA. A total of 46 patients with metastatic GEA were enrolled from 15 sites across the United States, Canada and South Korea. The data demonstrated zanidatamab combined with standard chemotherapy is a highly active treatment regimen for first-line therapy of HER2-positive metastatic GEA. In 42 patients evaluable for overall survival (“OS”) receiving zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy, the 18-month OS rate was 84% [95% CI: 68, 93], the 12-month OS rate was 88% [95% CI: 73, 95], and the median OS had not yet been reached (with 26.5 months median duration of study follow-up). These data represent the first OS data presented for a zanidatamab containing regimen. Treatment with zanidatamab resulted in a cORR of 79% [95% CI: 63, 90], a DCR of 92% [95% CI: 79, 98], with three patients achieving complete response among 38 response-evaluable patients. The median duration of response was 20.4 months [95% CI: 8.3, NE] with an mPFS of 
Table of Contents

12.5 months [95% CI: 7.1, NE] with 17 patients having an ongoing response at the time of data cut-off. The regimen was manageable, tolerable and consistent with the observed safety profiles reported for other standard combination regimens for patients with HER2-positive GEA. 
Zanidatamab is currently being evaluated in the following clinical trials:
•NCT05035836 – A Phase 2, single-site, single-arm open-label study to determine the efficacy of zanidatamab for patients with early stage low-risk HER2/neu positive breast cancer.

Union (“EU”). Zanidatamab has also been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation from the Center for Drug Evaluation in China for treating patients with BTC who have failed prior systemic therapies.
Early-Stage Clinical and Early Research and Development 
The below table summarizes our early-stage clinical and early Research and Development candidates.
Zanidatamab Zovodotin: HER2-Targeted Bispecific ADC
Overview
Zanidatamab zovodotin, our second product candidate, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. It is a biparatopic anti-HER2 ADC developed based on Zymeworks’ proprietary Azymetric multispecific and ZymeLink ADC platforms and combines the unique design of zanidatamab with a proprietary cytotoxin and cleavable linker. Our cytotoxin destabilizes tubulin, a protein necessary for cell division, and therefore kills rapidly dividing cancer cells. In preclinical models, compared to certain approved HER2-targeted therapies, zanidatamab zovodotin mediates a superior therapeutic effect on HER2-expressing tumors through multiple potential mechanisms, including:
•increased maximum HER2 binding density;
•unique biparatopic-induced HER2 receptor clustering;
•increased HER2-mediated ADC internalization; and
•enhanced toxin-mediated cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition.
We are developing zanidatamab zovodotin to be a potential best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC for several indications characterized by HER2 aberrations, especially for patients whose tumors have progressed or are refractory to HER2-targeted agents and those that express lower levels of HER2 and are ineligible for treatment with other HER2-targeted therapies. 
Preclinical Development of Zanidatamab Zovodotin 
In preclinical studies, zanidatamab zovodotin demonstrated complete tumor regressions in a panel of high and low HER2-expressing patient-derived xenografts and promising efficacy in a model of breast cancer brain metastases. These results compared favorably when benchmarked against approved and leading HER2 ADCs in clinical development. In a repeat dose 
Table of Contents

toxicology study in non-human primates, zanidatamab zovodotin was well tolerated at 18 mg/kg, suggesting a broad therapeutic window.
Clinical Development of Zanidatamab Zovodotin 
We are currently evaluating zanidatamab zovodotin as a monotherapy in a non-randomized, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with HER2 High breast, gastric and other HER2-expressing cancers, whose disease has progressed after all standard of care therapies. The primary objective of the Phase 1 clinical trial is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose of zanidatamab zovodotin. The secondary objectives for the trial include evaluation of preliminary antitumor activity of zanidatamab zovodotin, as well as an exploration of potential biomarkers of response. Based upon the observed safety and activity, subsequent development may focus on patients with HER2 High breast cancer, HER2 High gastric cancer, other HER2 High cancers, as well as cancers with lower levels of HER2 expression, including breast cancer. 
In September 2022, we presented preliminary Phase 1 trial results for zanidatamab zovodotin as monotherapy for the treatment of various HER2-positive tumors at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Annual Congress. A total of 77 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled in this first-in-human trial, which was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of zanidatamab zovodotin, characterize its safety and tolerability, and evaluate anti-tumor activity in HER2-expressing cancers as monotherapy. The patients represented a variety of HER2-expressing cancers including breast, gastroesophageal, ovarian, endometrial, bladder, biliary tract, anal, colorectal, pancreatic and lung. At the time of the analysis, the maximum tolerated dose had not yet been reached. In the trial, zanidatamab zovodotin was shown to have a manageable and differentiated safety profile with the majority of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The majority of patients (20/29) had received prior HER2-targeted therapies with patients receiving a median of three (range 1 to 13) prior therapies in the metastatic setting, including a median of six (range 3 to 13) in metastatic breast cancer and four (range of 1 to 8) in metastatic GEA. In patients with HER2-positive cancers treated with zanidatamab zovodotin at 2.5 mg/kg Q3W (dose escalation + dose expansion), the cORR was 31% [95% CI: 15.3, 50.8] and the DCR was 72% [95% CI: 52.8, 87.3]. The Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing and continues to enroll patients to study safety, tolerability and activity in various cohorts at the Q3W schedule. We expect to present updated results from this Phase 1 study before the end of 2023.
In January 2023, we announced our plans for the continued development of zanidatamab zovodotin at the RP2D of 2.5 mg/kg every three weeks and announced that by the end of 2023, we expect to present additional data from our clinical study that further supports this RP2D. Based on the data generated to date from the Phase 1 clinical study, which has continued to enroll subjects to gather additional data for zanidatamab zovodotin monotherapy, we plan to evaluate zanidatamab zovodotin as monotherapy and/or in combination with the current respective standards of care in multiple planned Phase 2 studies. Based on our development efforts to date and in combination with the results of these planned clinical studies, we believe these results may provide the rationale for one or more registration-enabling studies of zanidatamab zovodotin before the end of 2025, which we would expect to undertake with a future collaboration partner.
Other Preclinical Product Candidates
We maintain ongoing discovery efforts to identify and test new target combinations, product candidates and platform technologies that have the potential to address unmet medical needs. We have developed multiple preclinical product candidates targeting a combination of known and novel tumor antigens based on our platform technologies. All of these candidates remain unpartnered. We continue to focus on advancing multiple well-differentiated product candidates into clinical trials to build our pipeline portfolio as well as exploiting our protein engineering and ADC expertise to develop innovative product candidates.
As part of our early Research and Development day held in New York City in October 2022, we announced multiple preclinical product candidates, including two lead candidates, ZW191 and ZW171. Our lead ADC preclinical product candidate, ZW191, is a folate receptor alpha targeted ADC with a novel TOPO1i-based payload that we believe may be competitive in areas with high unmet medical need. Similarly, our lead multispecific preclinical product candidate, ZW171, a novel and differentiated MSLN-targeted bispecific T-cell engaging antibody generated utilizing our Azymetric bispecific platform, targets the potential treatment of patients in pancreatic, mesothelioma, ovarian, and other MSLN-expressing cancers. We expect to submit IND applications for ZW191 and ZW171 in 2024. 
We expect to continue developing additional early-stage ADC and multispecific product candidates, such as ZW251, a glypican-3 targeted TOPO1i-based ADC, and ZW220, a NaPi2b targeted ADC with a TOPO1i-based payload, as well as additional preclinical product candidates currently in development.

Our Proprietary Therapeutic Platforms
Our expertise in protein engineering has enabled the development of our proprietary therapeutic platforms, a complementary suite of highly tailored biologics solutions. Our therapeutic platforms can be used alone or in combination to develop multifunctional fit-for-purpose biotherapeutics with bispecific capabilities (Azymetric), targeted cytotoxin payload delivery and linker technologies (Drug Conjugate Platforms), finely tuned immune function modulation (EFECT), and tumor-specific immune co-stimulation (ProTECT). The modular design and ease of use of our therapeutic platforms allow for the design and evaluation of multiple candidates with different formats to determine the optimal therapeutic combination early in development. We continue to leverage these therapeutic platforms to expand our pipeline of next-generation multispecific and ADCs that we believe could represent significant improvements to the standard of care in multiple cancer types and other serious diseases.
Azymetric Multispecific Antibody Platform
The Azymetric multispecific antibody platform is our foundation platform, which can produce either the backbone of our ADCs or be the base of our multispecific therapeutics that can be combined with both our trispecific T-cell engager (“TriTCE”) technology and our ProTECT platform to develop potential best-in-class trispecifics. The Azymetric platform consists of a library of proprietary amino acid substitutions that enable the transformation of monospecific antibodies into bispecific or trispecific antibodies, which gives them the ability to simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes. The Azymetric platform enables the development of biotherapeutics with dual-targeting of receptors/ligands and simultaneous blockade of multiple signaling pathways, increasing tumor-specific targeting and efficacy while reducing toxicities and the potential for drug resistance. In preclinical studies, the dual targeting of Azymetric antibodies has demonstrated synergistic activity relative to the application of an equivalent dose of the corresponding monospecific antibodies. Azymetric multispecifics can also be engineered to enhance internalization of the antibody into the tumor cell and consequently increase the delivery of cytotoxins. Azymetric multispecifics retain the desirable drug-like qualities of monoclonal antibodies, including long half-life, stability and low immunogenic potential, which increases their probability of success. Azymetric multispecifics are also compatible with standard manufacturing processes with high production yields and purity.
The Azymetric platform is the foundation for the development of trispecific and trivalent antibodies. Our complementary suite of technologies can incorporate multiple targets and mechanisms of action within a single antibody-based therapeutic. To achieve efficacy and durability in a difficult tumor microenvironment, we have developed a TriTCE strategy that integrates checkpoint inhibition (“TriTCE-CPI”) and costimulatory technologies (“TriTCE-costim”). TriTCE-CPI technology is designed to navigate suppressive tumor microenvironments and enhance the activity of T-cell engagers through incorporation of a checkpoint pathway binder to restore and enhance T-cell engagement and overcome secondary resistance to provide durable responses. TriTCE-costim technology can increase T-cell fitness, activation and proliferation via tumor-dependent T-cell co-stimulation. Further, T-cell engager technologies can integrate with ProTECT, a technology built to mask an antibody arm to improve selectivity to minimize off-target, and mitigate on-target, adverse events. 
Drug Conjugate Platforms
Our Drug Conjugate Platforms are a suite of proprietary cytotoxins (including both topoisomerase and microtubulin inhibiting toxins), stable linkers, and conjugation technologies that are compatible with and complementary to our product candidates and enable delivery of cytotoxins directly to target cells. We believe that our platforms provide multiple competitive advantages over existing ADC approaches, including optimized activity and tolerability profiles through increased drug delivery to target cells with reduced off-target effects, as well as improved pharmacokinetics and stability. Our Drug Conjugate Platforms can be used in conjunction with our other therapeutic platforms to potentially increase safety and efficacy as compared to existing ADC technologies.

EFECT Antibody Effector Function Modulation Platform
The EFECT platform consists of sets of modifications to the crystallizable fragment (“Fc”) region of antibodies that enable the selective modulation of recruited cytotoxic immune cells for diverse therapeutic applications. This allows us to rationally tailor the selective enhancement or suppression of immune effector function to optimize product candidates.
ProTECT Tumor-Specific Immune Co-stimulation Platform
The ProTECT platform is a novel conditionally active antibody technology that can simultaneously increase the tolerability and efficacy for therapeutics, thereby potentially enhancing therapeutic window and clinical utility. Functional, natural immunomodulatory heterodimers are introduced to sterically block antigen binding outside the tumor, enabling therapeutics with limited activity in normal healthy tissue, avoiding on-target, off-tumor toxicities. Once in the tumor microenvironment, specific proteases cleave and release one half of the functional block activating both the targeting antibody and the immunomodulatory function. The resulting activated multifunctional therapeutic enables immune modulation in concert with antigen binding, which enables an overall increase in the therapeutic window through selective tumor activity and enhanced potency. 
Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations
The table below summarizes the stage of each of our partners’ most advanced publicly disclosed program.
Our novel product candidates, together with our combination of proprietary protein engineering capabilities and resulting therapeutic platform technologies, have enabled us to enter into a number of strategic partnerships, many of which were subsequently expanded in scope. Our strategic partnerships and collaborations provide us with the ability to accelerate clinical development of our product candidates in certain geographical regions and provide our strategic partners with access to components of our proprietary therapeutic platforms for their own therapeutics development. In addition, these strategic partnerships have provided us with non-dilutive funding as well as access to proprietary therapeutic assets, which increase our ability to rapidly advance our product candidates while maintaining commercial rights to our own therapeutics.
Through collaboration agreements with Jazz and BeiGene relating to our lead programs for zanidatamab and zanidatamab zovodotin, we have received over $435 million through December 31, 2022 in the form of non-refundable upfront payments and milestone payments. In addition, through these partnerships, we are eligible to receive up to $1.75 billion in potential regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on potential future product sales, pending receipt of regulatory approval. These partnerships have provided us with a significant source of non-dilutive funding and provide for the future funding requirements for our lead asset, zanidatamab. These partnerships also leverage our partners’ commercial infrastructure, helping accelerate the development and expanding the potential reach of our lead product candidates. 
To date, we have received approximately $180.0 million in the form of non-refundable upfront and milestone payments from platform partnership and collaboration agreements, excluding amounts received related to zanidatamab or zanidatamab

zovodotin. We continue to have revenue-generating strategic partnerships and collaborations with respect to our Azymetric, EFECT and Drug Conjugate therapeutic platforms with BeiGene, BMS, GSK, Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen, LEO, Iconic, Merck and Atreca. Under these revenue-generating strategic partnerships and collaboration agreements, we are eligible to receive up to $2.8 billion in preclinical and development milestone payments and up to $5.9 billion in commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on potential future product sales, pending regulatory approval. It is possible, however, that our strategic partners’ programs will not advance as currently contemplated, which would negatively affect the amount of development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on potential future product sales we may receive. Importantly, these partnerships include predominantly non-target-exclusive licenses for any of our therapeutic platforms, so we maintain the ability to develop therapeutics directed to many high-value targets utilizing our platforms. 
Our strategic partnerships and collaborations include the following:
Jazz
In October 2022, Zymeworks BC entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Jazz Collaboration Agreement”) with Jazz, under which Jazz will have development and commercialization rights of zanidatamab throughout the world, but excluding existing territories already governed by Zymeworks BC’s agreement with BeiGene (the “Territory”). BeiGene has exclusive rights, pursuant to an agreement with Zymeworks BC dated November 26, 2018, as amended (the “BeiGene Agreement”), to commercialize zanidatamab in those countries that are excluded from the Territory.
Under the terms of the Jazz Collaboration Agreement, Zymeworks BC granted to Jazz an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of Zymeworks BC’s intellectual property, to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize in the Territory pharmaceutical products containing or incorporating zanidatamab or certain related antibodies (such antibodies, collectively, “Licensed Antibodies” such pharmaceutical products, “Licensed Products”). Licensed Antibodies and Licensed Products expressly exclude all ADCs, including Zymeworks BC’s proprietary ADC, zanidatamab zovodotin. Zymeworks BC also granted to Jazz a non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of Zymeworks BC’s intellectual property, to research, preclinically develop and manufacture Licensed Products outside the Territory for the sole purpose of furthering the development and commercialization of Licensed Products in the Territory.
Jazz granted Zymeworks BC certain licenses, under certain of Jazz’s intellectual property, to develop and commercialize Licensed Antibodies and Licensed Products outside the Territory, to conduct certain development and manufacturing activities with respect to the Licensed Products in the Territory, and to make and have made Licensed Antibodies for incorporation into zanidatamab zovodotin, for development and commercialization both in and outside the Territory. If the BeiGene Agreement is terminated, in whole or in part, Jazz has a right of first negotiation to develop or commercialize any Licensed Product in such countries. In November 2022, the waiting period under the United States Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 expired (such clearance, the “HSR Clearance”).
During the Term (as defined below), Jazz and its affiliates are prohibited from performing any clinical development of, or commercialization of, any pharmaceutical product containing a bispecific antibody directed to the ECD2 and ECD4 domains of HER2 in the Territory, other than Licensed Products. During the Term, Zymeworks BC and its affiliates are prohibited from performing any preclinical development (except for certain independent, internal preclinical development by Zymeworks BC or its affiliates) or clinical development of, or commercializing, any pharmaceutical product that is directed to HER2 in the Territory (each, a “Zymeworks Competing Product”), other than Licensed Products; provided that zanidatamab zovodotin is excluded from this restriction. Zymeworks BC retains the right to grant third parties rights to apply any of Zymeworks BC’s platforms to derive or generate, without any assistance from Zymeworks BC, antibodies directed to any biological target where Zymeworks BC is not aware of the identity of any such target, and Zymeworks BC retains the right to fulfill its obligations under agreements with its existing platform partners; provided, however, that Zymeworks BC cannot generate, or grant development or commercialization licenses to, Zymeworks Competing Products in new platform-based agreements entered into after the effective date of the Jazz Collaboration Agreement.
As between Jazz and Zymeworks BC, Jazz will be solely responsible for all development and commercial activities with respect to Licensed Products in the Territory, and all such development and commercial activities in the Territory shall be at Jazz’s sole cost and expense, except that Zymeworks BC shall be responsible for the continued conduct of clinical trials for zanidatamab initiated by Zymeworks BC prior to the execution of the Jazz Collaboration Agreement (collectively, the “Zymeworks Ongoing Studies”), including those clinical trials initiated by Zymeworks BC in South Korea, and filing of the first Biologics License Application for the Licensed Product (the “First BLA”), at Jazz’s cost and expense subject to the terms and conditions under the Jazz Collaboration Agreement. Following regulatory approval of the First BLA or earlier upon Jazz’s written request, Zymeworks BC will promptly transfer the First BLA to Jazz.
Jazz shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for a Licensed Product in certain major market countries for the treatment of certain diseases. Jazz will be the holder of regulatory approvals and regulatory

Royalties are payable on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country, (ii) the expiration of the last valid licensed patent claim within the licensed Zymeworks BC intellectual property covering such Licensed Product in such country, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity of such Licensed Product in such country.
Zymeworks BC shall solely own all inventions made by the parties solely or jointly that specifically relate to the composition of matter of zanidatamab and any invention made solely by Zymeworks BC and its affiliates. Jazz shall own all inventions made solely by Jazz. Inventions made jointly by the parties shall be owned jointly by the parties.
Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Jazz Collaboration Agreement will continue on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such Licensed Product in such country (the “Term”). On a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the Term, the license granted to Jazz in such country shall become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable.
At any time, Jazz may terminate the Jazz Collaboration Agreement, in its entirety or on a region-by-region basis, by providing written notice of termination to Zymeworks BC. In the event that Jazz or its affiliates file or initiate a patent challenge against Zymeworks BC, Zymeworks BC may terminate the Jazz Collaboration Agreement unless such challenge is withdrawn, abandoned, or terminated following Jazz’s receipt of written notice from Zymeworks BC. Subject to certain conditions, either party may terminate the Jazz Collaboration Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party.
Upon the termination of the Jazz Collaboration Agreement for any reason, all licenses and other rights granted to Jazz by Zymeworks BC shall terminate. Licenses granted by Jazz to Zymeworks BC shall continue following the effective date of termination, and Jazz shall grant to Zymeworks BC a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property controlled by Jazz that either arises from the Jazz Collaboration Agreement or is used by or on behalf of Jazz in the development, manufacture, or commercialization of Licensed Products. If Jazz has the right to terminate the Jazz Collaboration Agreement because Zymeworks BC was in material breach of the Jazz Collaboration Agreement and did not timely cure such breach, Jazz may elect to have the Jazz Collaboration Agreement continue in full force and effect and all amounts thereafter payable by Jazz under the Jazz Collaboration Agreement will be reduced, and Jazz will have no further obligations to develop and commercialize each Licensed Product in each major market.
The Jazz Collaboration Agreement also includes certain other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations and warranties, indemnification, and confidentiality provisions.

We recognized a $5.0 million research license fee payment in association with this licensing agreement in conjunction with future option exercise fees and development, regulatory, and commercial milestones as well as tiered royalties on net sales of any licensed products at single-digit royalty rates.
Intellectual Property
Our business success will depend significantly on our ability to:
•secure, maintain and enforce patent and other proprietary protection for our core technologies, inventions and know-how;
•obtain and maintain licenses to key third-party intellectual property owned by such third parties;
•preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
•operate without infringing upon valid, enforceable third-party patents and other rights.
We seek to secure and maintain patent protection for the composition of matter, manufacturing processes and methods of use for our drug candidates and for our underlying protein engineering capabilities and therapeutic platforms including Azymetric, EFECT, ZymeLink, ZymeCAD and ProTECT. We also utilize trade secrets, careful monitoring and limited disclosure of our proprietary information where patent protection is not appropriate. We also protect our proprietary information by ensuring that our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors execute agreements requiring non-disclosure and assignment of inventions prior to their engagement. We intend to continue to expand our intellectual property holdings by seeking patent protection for new compositions of matter, new features and applications of our core therapeutic platforms, and innovative new therapeutic platforms, in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also intend to supplement internal innovation through in-licensing of new technologies and compositions of matter as appropriate. We intend to take advantage of any available data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions.
We routinely monitor the status of existing and emerging intellectual property disclosed by third parties that may impact our business, and to the extent we identify any such disclosures, by evaluating them and taking appropriate courses of action.

Technology Licensing and In-Licensed Intellectual Property 
We identify and, from time to time, selectively enter into technology licensing agreements and intellectual property in-licensing agreements to support pipeline advancement. For example, in March 2016, we entered into an assignment agreement with CDRD Ventures Inc. (“CVI”), as part of our acquisition of Kairos Therapeutics Inc. (“Kairos”), pursuant to which all of CVI’s interests in Kairos’ patents and intellectual property were assigned to us. Under the assignment agreement, we may be required to make future payments of up to an aggregate of C$8.5 million, consisting of (i) a C$2.5 million payment when the first patient is dosed in the first Phase 2 trial and (ii) a C$6.0 million payment when the first patient is dosed in the first Phase 3 trial, to CVI for zanidatamab zovodotin or other product candidates upon the direct achievement of certain clinical development milestones for products incorporating certain Kairos intellectual property. In addition, CVI is eligible to receive low single-digit royalty payments from us on the net sales of such products, pending receipt of regulatory approval. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration, revocation, invalidation or abandonment of the last valid claim within the patents covering such products in the country of sale. For out-licensed products and technologies incorporating certain Kairos intellectual property, we also may be required to pay CVI a mid-single-digit percentage of certain future revenue.

Manufacturing
We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to provide manufacturing, linker-toxin conjugation, and fill-finish services in order to generate all of the therapeutic antibody supply required for our clinical studies and other research and development activities. To retain focus on our expertise in developing new product candidates, we do not currently plan to develop or operate in-house manufacturing capacity. Our bispecific therapeutic antibody candidates require standard chemistry, manufacturing and control (“CMC”) processes typical of those required for monoclonal antibody manufacturing. We therefore expect to continue to be able to develop product candidates that can be manufactured in a cost-effective fashion by our network of qualified third-party contract manufacturing organizations.
Through our contract manufacturing organizations, we currently have sufficient supply of our product candidates to carry out ongoing and planned preclinical studies. For zanidatamab, we also have sufficient current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”)-grade supply, together with planned additional manufacturing runs, to complete our ongoing clinical trials. For zanidatamab zovodotin, we have sufficient cGMP-grade supply, together with planned additional manufacturing runs, to complete our ongoing clinical trial and anticipated clinical trials.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
With respect to target discovery activities, competitors and other third parties, including academic and clinical researchers, may be able to access rare families and identify targets before we do.
Many of the companies against which we compete or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials, and by acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, the effectiveness of alternative products, the level of competition and the availability of coverage, and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic or biosimilar products.
Zanidatamab and zanidatamab zovodotin are being developed for patients with solid tumors that express HER2, including patients with tumors expressing low levels of HER2. Competing approved HER2-targeted therapies include F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.’s Herceptin, Perjeta, Phesgo, and Kadcyla as well as Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s Tykerb, Puma Biotechnology, Inc.’s Nerlynx, AstraZeneca PLC / Daiichi Sankyo’s Enhertu, Seagen Inc.’s Tukysa, MacroGenics, Inc.’s Margenza, and various trastuzumab biosimilars. 
The FDA and corresponding regulatory authorities will ultimately review our clinical results and determine whether our product candidates are effective. No regulatory agency has made any such determination that any of our product candidates are effective for use by the general public for any indication.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our ADC product candidates are comprised of both a drug product and a biologic product, and will therefore be subject to regulation in the United States as combination products. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to an FDA center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our ADCs, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product. Thus, our product candidates are regulated as therapeutic biologics, with the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research having primary jurisdiction over premarket development.
Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical, laboratory tests and preclinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices (“GLP”);
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practice (“cGCP”) regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
•submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labelling.
Table of Contents

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive reporting, monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators.
A sponsor, an institutional review board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee, the FDA or other regulatory or monitoring authorities may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in government regulations or administrative actions.
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. When a BLA is submitted, the FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. Upon accepting the BLA for filing, the FDA will conduct an in-depth review the BLA and may hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors considers key questions regarding the product candidate. This advisory committee makes a recommendation to the FDA, which is not binding on the FDA, but is generally followed.
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. In particular, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track designated products, sponsors may have a higher number of interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s New Drug Application or BLA before the application is complete. The FDA has granted two Fast Track designations to zanidatamab for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing GEA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and for previously treated or recurrent gene-amplified BTC.
The FDA also may designate a product as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically important endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For products that have been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Products designated as a Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA can also be eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab in HER2 gene-amplified BTC patients who have received prior systemic chemotherapy. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the company’s request or by the FDA’s initiative. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug or other elements to assure safe use, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug.
Table of Contents

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and cGCP requirements.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor (for example, requiring labeling changes) or major (for example, requiring additional clinical trials). Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Orphan Drug Designation
The Orphan Drug Act established incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States at the time of the request for orphan designation. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other applicable requirements, the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation to the product for that use. The FDA has granted zanidatamab Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of BTC and GEA.
The benefits of Orphan Drug Designation include tax credits for clinical testing expenses and exemption from user fees. A drug candidate that is approved for the orphan drug designated use typically is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. However, the FDA Reauthorization Act, which was enacted in 2017, requires, among other things, that certain orphan drugs for cancer be tested for children. The government has also increased focus on the potential misuse of the orphan drug approval process to increase the price of orphan drugs.
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease, and not to all uses or indications within the entire disease or condition. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked the FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
Even if regulatory approval is granted, a marketed product is subject to continuing comprehensive requirements under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements and restrictions regarding adverse event reporting, 
Table of Contents

recordkeeping, marketing, and compliance with cGMP. Adverse events reported after approval of a drug can result in additional restrictions on the use of a marketed product or requirements for additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials.
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture or promotion of an approved product may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as significant administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product.
Under the BPCIA, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as the first interchangeable for biologic products. 
Canadian Review and Approval Process
In Canada, our biologic product candidates and our research and development activities are primarily regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, which are enforced by Health Canada. Health Canada regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Drug approval laws require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, and government review and approval of experimental results prior to giving approval to sell drug products, including biologic drug products. Regulators also typically require that rigorous and specific standards such as cGMP, GLP and cGCP are followed in the manufacture, testing and clinical development, respectively, of any drug product. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in Canada, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
The principal steps required for drug approval in Canada are as follows:
Preclinical Toxicology Studies and Clinical Trials
Non-clinical studies are conducted in vitro and in animals to evaluate pharmacokinetics, metabolism and possible toxic effects to provide evidence of the safety of the drug candidate prior to its administration to humans in clinical studies and throughout development. Such studies are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and GLP.
In Canada, the process of conducting clinical trials with a new drug cannot begin until a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) is submitted and the required number of days has lapsed without objection from Health Canada. Biological drugs carry additional risks, as compared to traditional small-molecule drugs, associated with complexity and variability in manufacturing that can contribute to increased lot-to-lot variation of the final product, and with the potential for adventitious agents. Therefore, the content requirements for the quality information for biological drugs to be used in clinical trials are different from those for standard small-molecule pharmaceutical drugs (for example, the inclusion of information on manufacturing facilities is required 
Table of Contents

for biological drugs). In addition, it is necessary to have more stringent controls on the release of biologic drug lots used in authorized clinical trials.
Similar regulations apply in Canada regarding clinical trials as in the United States. In Canada, Research Ethics Boards (“REBs”), instead of IRBs, are used to review and approve clinical trial plans. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, as discussed above in the context of government regulation in the United States.
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into Canada are also subject to regulation by Health Canada relating to their labeling and distribution. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must generally be submitted at least annually to Health Canada and/or the applicable REBs, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. 
New Drug Submission
Upon successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials, the company sponsoring a new drug then assembles all the preclinical and clinical data and other testing relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, and submits it to Health Canada as part of a New Drug Submission (“NDS”). The NDS is then reviewed by Health Canada for approval to market the drug.
The testing and approval process for an NDS requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Biologic drugs, such as our candidates, differ from standard small-molecule drugs in that applicants must include more detailed chemistry and manufacturing information. This is necessary to help ensure the purity and quality of the product, for example to help ensure that it is not contaminated by an undesired microorganism. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Health Canada may not grant approval of an NDS on a timely basis, or at all.
Even if Health Canada approves a product candidate, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms.
Biologic products in particular are monitored post-approval by being placed on a lot-release schedule tailored to their potential risk, manufacturing, testing and inspection history to date. With higher-risk biologics, each lot is tested before being released for sale in Canada. Moderate-risk biologics are periodically tested at the discretion of Health Canada while manufacturers of low-risk biologics usually only need to contact Health Canada regarding lots being sold or for providing certification of complete and satisfactory testing. Products are carefully scrutinized before they are placed in any level of the lot-release process, and the testing regime for a biologic may be altered at any time. On December 17, 2022, the Minister of Health in Canada published proposed amendments to the Food and Drug Regulations, and several of the amendments relate to biologic drugs. The purpose of the amendments is to modernize the biologics regulatory regime by repealing outdated requirements and replacing them with those that reflect current safety practices. Proposed amendments include enabling Health Canada to require certain labelling statements for safety reasons on a case-by-case basis, and clarifying the Minister’s authority to consider information or material obtained during on-site evaluations. Other proposed amendments include clarifying the record retention expectations for market authorization holders, and providing a general framework to minimize the potential for contamination of drugs, active ingredients and biological source material between processes. The proposed amendments are still in draft form.
Health Canada may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, notification, and regulatory authority review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or regulatory notification may be required.
Canadian Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The term biosimilar is used by Health Canada to describe a biologic drug that enters the market subsequent to a version previously authorized in Canada and with demonstrated similarity to a reference biologic drug. Accordingly, a biosimilar (previously known in Canada as a subsequent entry biologic or SEB) will in all instances be a subsequent entrant onto the Canadian market.

Based on Health Canada guidance documents, a biosimilar can rely in part on prior information regarding safety and efficacy that is deemed relevant due to the demonstration of similarity to the reference biologic drug and which influences the amount and type of original data required. Generic drugs are chemically derived products that are pharmaceutically equivalent to innovative drugs, whereas biosimilars are products of a biologic nature that are similar to innovative biologics. According to Health Canada, it is not currently possible to demonstrate that two biologic drugs are pharmaceutically equivalent, and therefore the regulatory approval process for generics and biosimilars is different: biosimilars are approved using the standard NDS pathway with some allowances made for reduced safety and efficacy information set out in guidance documents, while generic drugs are approved using an abbreviated new drug submission pathway set out in guidance and law. In part because it continues to be set out only in guidance and not law, the pathway for receiving biosimilar approval is somewhat in flux and subject to some uncertainty.
As discussed above, all biosimilars enter the market subsequent to a biologic drug product previously approved in Canada and to which the biosimilar is considered similar. As such, biosimilars are subject to existing laws and regulations outlined in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations, and related guidance documents.
Similar to the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in the United States, Canada has the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, which require a company that files a drug submission that references a patented product to address any relevant patents listed on the Patent Register prior to being able to receive approval from Health Canada. The Canadian regime is similar to the U.S. regime, but a number of distinctions do exist.
Like the United States, Canada also has data protection in addition to patent protection, but again differences exist between the two jurisdictions. For example, Canada’s data protection applies to “innovative drugs” (i.e., a drug that contains a medicinal ingredient not previously approved in a drug by the Minister of Health and that is not a variation of a previously approved medicinal ingredient such as a salt, ester, enantiomer, solvate or polymorph) and, where it exists, lasts for eight years in most (but not all) circumstances. In general biologics can be considered innovative drugs but biosimilars are not.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, provincial, state and federal U.S. and Canadian laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States and Canada
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, coverage, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with cGCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on pricing and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from

third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payors may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, requiring pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are often used as models by private payors and other governmental payors to develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products to obtain third-party payor coverage, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.
In international markets, pricing, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some other jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our future products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single-source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear.
We expect that the PPACA, as well as reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once regulatory approval is obtained.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other state and local government agencies.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the U.S. federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We may also be subject to additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement with a governmental entity to resolve allegations that we have violated these laws. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Sales and Marketing
As a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, we do not currently possess the commercial infrastructure required to launch and market our product candidates. For zanidatamab and zanidatamab zovodotin, we have entered into development and commercialization agreements with BeiGene whereby BeiGene is responsible for certain clinical development activities and all commercial activities in Asia (excluding Japan but including the People’s Republic of China, South Korea and other countries), Australia and New Zealand. For zanidatamab, under the Jazz Collaboration Agreement, Jazz is responsible for all development and commercial activities globally outside of the BeiGene territories, at Jazz’s cost and expense. To date, we have not entered into any other agreements granting commercialization rights to zanidatamab, zanidatamab zovodotin or any of our other product candidates. To access the sales, marketing and distribution capacity required to market our drug candidates, we plan to selectively establish additional partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies having established commercial capabilities in relevant indications. The timing and nature of such agreements will be determined by market size and complexity, access to pre-commercial and commercial infrastructure and our resource availability for developing a commercial organization. For product candidates targeting patient populations that can be serviced by a small, specialized commercial effort, we may seek out co-development and co-promotion agreements granting commercialization rights to an established commercial partner in some jurisdictions while allowing us to build these capabilities in other jurisdictions.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 294 employees, including 291 full-time employees, 196 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 68 of whom hold an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. 168 of our full-time employees were based in Canada and 123 in the United States. As part of our renewed focus on achieving our key strategic priorities, in January 2022, we announced our intention to restructure our workforce with a target of reducing our employee headcount by at least 25% across the organization by the end of 2022. As of March 31, 2022, we had exceeded that 25% target.
We consider our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects and believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We monitor our compensation programs closely and provide what we consider to be a competitive mix of compensation and benefits for all our employees, including participation in our equity programs. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining arrangement.
