Industry Trends
For over two decades, the mobile industry has experienced tremendous advancements and growth. As the largest technology platform in the world, mobile connectivity has changed the way we work, the way we live and the way we connect with each other. The scale and pace of innovation in mobile technology, especially around connectivity and computing capabilities, is also impacting industries beyond traditional wireless.
We are working with leading global service providers and enterprises in the mobile and 5G fixed wireless access (“FWA”) ecosystems to further develop, commercialize and accelerate the availability of 5G-based solutions, which represent the next generation of mobile technology. 5G enables intelligent connectivity and is a catalyst for innovation and acceleration of the fourth industrial revolution across a wide range of vertical markets, including manufacturing, agriculture, utilities, industrial automation, retail, education, government, and healthcare. 
5G addresses the constraints of 4G LTE technology with wider spectrum bandwidths, multi-gigabit speeds, and ultra-reliable low latency, in addition to other advancements. As the fifth-generation wireless broadband technology, 5G is based on the Release 15 standard defined by the Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”), an international consortium responsible for the development of mobile standards. The key operating ranges for the 5G spectrum globally are in the sub-6 GHz (below 6 GHz), and millimeter wave (28 GHz and 39 GHz) bands, with speed offerings greater than 1 Gigabit (“Gb”) per second and sub-millisecond latency, providing better coverage and signaling efficiency. 
The technological advancements of 5G technology, combined with many of the innovations developed for 4G LTE, provide a scalable and adaptable solution for a variety of use cases, which enable the creation of new industries and services, such as autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, live ultra-high-definition video streaming, cloud gaming, edge computing, and countless industrial applications such as augmented reality and robotics for smart manufacturing. 
The development of these new services and applications results in a growing demand for high-speed data, increased capacity, and low latency requirements which are key factors contributing to the accelerated growth and roll-out of 5G networks. 4G LTE is expected to continue to operate alongside 5G as a major part of the wireless ecosystem. Based on industry reports, such as the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (“GSMA”) Intelligence’s report The Mobile Economy, and the biannual Ericsson Mobility Report we believe that 4G and 5G networks will coexist and remain complementary for many years. This means that operators will be able to service a significant share of the data traffic on 4G networks, leaving 5G with the dual remit of absorbing overflow capacity and underpinning consumer and enterprise services that require higher speeds and/or lower latency. As such, most 5G devices are expected to include multimode support for 4G and Wi-Fi, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed and simultaneous connectivity across 4G and Wi-Fi 
technologies, while also allowing mobile operators to utilize current 5G network deployments. At the same time, 4G is expected to continue to evolve in parallel with the development of 5G and become fundamental to many of the key 5G technologies, such as support for unlicensed spectrum, gigabit LTE user data rates (currently available from Inseego) and cellular IoT with connectivity designed to meet the needs of ultra-low-power and low-cost applications.
Further, based on reports from analyst firms including GSMA Intelligence and IoT Analytics, we expect that the number of IoT connections could grow to 27 billion by 2025, of which cellular-based IoT connections could reach 4 billion. By 2025, global 4G connections will reach just under 55% of total connections. Meanwhile, 5G migration is gaining pace. According to Ericsson’s Mobility Report, November 2022 Edition, the rise of 5G has outpaced 4G within the first years of deployment. By the end of 2028, over five billion 5G subscriptions are forecast globally, which would account for 55 percent of all mobile subscriptions. 5G subscription uptake has been faster than that of 4G, following the launch of 4G in 2009, with 5G expected to reach one billion subscriptions two years sooner than with the 4G launch. 4G is now declining rapidly in many markets and is expected to fall behind 5G in terms of adoption for the first time in 2023. 
Based on reports, we believe that 5G will bring a number of enhanced benefits not available using 4G networks, including providing networks with massive numbers of IoT devices and wireless edge technologies with differing speed, bandwidth and quality of service demands for use cases including manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, and video AI, and networking. We are increasingly diversifying our business as this 5G opportunity comes into realization and our addressable market expands. 
The adoption of 5G and the cloud continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging digital transformation technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance and build new business models. This growth is expanding broadly, and adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries and in industrial IoT markets such as smart city infrastructure, utilities, energy management, retail and manufacturing. We are building intelligent edge capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on most major carrier networks. We have developed solutions that address key market needs for asset tracking applications, telematics, SD-WAN failover management, retail, remote work, remote monitoring and various other automation applications. In addition, our cloud solutions can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable insights for our customers so they can develop new services and create revenue growth.

Cybersecurity
In the normal course of business, we may collect and store personal information and certain sensitive Company information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party information and employee information. To protect this information, our existing cybersecurity policies require monitoring and detection programs, network security measures, encryption of critical data, and security assessment of vendors. We perform cyber-incident simulations and tabletop exercises to help with our overall risk-preparedness. We maintain various protections designed to safeguard against cyberattacks, including firewalls and virus detection software. We have established and test our disaster recovery plan and we protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. Additionally, we routinely scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess the effectiveness of our data security practices. Our internal security team makes continuous efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber-attacks. We continue to make significant investments in security and maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.
Our cybersecurity program is led by our Director of Information Security and Privacy. The program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information. Our cybersecurity team provides regular, timely updates to the Board of Directors on information security and cybersecurity matters, as needed. Our Security Council, has oversight responsibility for our data security practices and we believe the committee has the requisite skills and visibility into the design and operation of our data security practices to fulfill this responsibility effectively.
Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.
Human Capital Resources
Our Culture: Culture is critically important to our growth and performance. We are driven by our values of Accountability, Sense of Urgency, Market Driven Innovation, Customer Focus, and Integrity. We are committed to creating a world class employee experience through leadership development, career planning, open two-way communications, total compensation, and positive work environment.
Diversity & Inclusion: Our people are our most important asset. At Inseego, we embrace an inclusive culture because good ideas come from everywhere. Diversity comes in all forms, from different backgrounds and experiences to different perspectives and skill sets. It is this diversity that fuels innovation. It is this common passion to innovate that makes Inseego an equal opportunity employer. Inseego does not unlawfully discriminate in any employment decisions, including hiring, compensation, promotion, discipline, or termination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, protected veteran status or disability. Inseego is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities and individuals with sincerely held religious beliefs and practices.
Talent: We believe that talent is key to our success. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. Our company size and culture allows employees to build and expand their skill set in ways that will enrich their careers. Our goal setting and performance evaluation process enables the company to focus on accelerating development for those who are top performers and strengthening the talent pipeline.
Work Life Balance: We believe that it is important to provide Work Life Harmony and our practices can vary globally. In the U.S., employees have Friday ‘summer hours’ where two hours in the afternoon are blocked from meetings to ensure that there is “work” and “think” time. This time can be used to catch up on tasks, conduct a review of the past week, and plan for the following week. Inseego has a flexible time off policy that does not limit employee time off to fixed accruals for exempt employees in the U.S. This program gives team members the flexibility to take time off that makes sense for them and frees employees from the confines of traditional accrued time off policies. We also encourage flexibility and balance by embracing remote and hybrid work whenever possible.
Employee Health and Wellness: As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to convenient health and wellness programs. These programs include benefits that provide protection and security to help give our employees peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. We offer choice where possible so employees can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. We also sponsor various  Health & Wellness Initiatives in the U.S. to help employees find ways to create more balance in their lives.
Governmental Regulations
Environmental Laws: Our products and manufacturing process are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials as well as environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory effects on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and compliance effort to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations.
Other Regulations: As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future.
