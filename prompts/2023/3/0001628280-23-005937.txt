ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Clear Secure, Inc. (the “Company” or “CLEAR”) is an identity company obsessed with the customer experience. We make everyday experiences frictionless by connecting your identity to the things that make you, YOU - transforming the way you live, work, and travel. CLEAR has been delivering friction-free experiences in airports for over a decade, achieving exceptional user delight and trust with CLEAR Plus, our consumer aviation subscription service. CLEAR Plus enables access to predictable and fast experiences through dedicated entry lanes in airport security checkpoints nationwide. As we continue to innovate on the travel experience, we are proud to offer TSA PreCheck® Enrollment Provided by CLEAR–providing consumers with increased choice in where and how to sign up for this popular trusted traveler program–which we expect to soft launch in early 2023. Our business to business (“B2B”) offering, Powered by CLEAR extends our identity platform to partners so they can deliver the same friction-free experiences to their customers leveraging software development kits (“SDKs”) and application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Powered by CLEAR offers solutions to partners such as identity verification, virtual queuing, and credential validation (e.g., age validation and health attributes, among others). Our flagship CLEAR app offers free to consumer products like Home-to-Gate and Health Pass, and in the future will also include Reserve Powered by CLEAR, our virtual queuing technology that enables customers to manage lines.
Our Business
Since 2010 we have been expanding our network, investing in our technology platform, strengthening our operations and developing our people to consistently deliver increased value to members and partners, resulting in the growth and trust of the CLEAR brand.
We have built an extensive physical footprint with a nationwide network of airports, stadiums and businesses to offer members frictionless, trusted experiences as they move and transact throughout the day in both physical and digital environments. As of December 31, 2022, our expansive network of partners and use cases provide our members with access to our nationwide network of 48 airports covering 132 lanes, 16 sports and entertainment partners with priority lanes, and a growing list of B2B partners. The continued expansion of our partnerships enable our partners to integrate with CLEAR and our members to use CLEAR in new places and in new ways.
Today, our owned and operated businesses such as CLEAR Plus (our consumer aviation subscription service) and our mobile applications are the largest users of our platform. We have enabled 130 million Total Cumulative Platform Uses across our network of airport, sports and B2B partners as of December 31, 2022. Our approximately 2,800 hospitality and security focused part-time and full-time ambassadors and field managers on the ground bring our technology to life and work to deliver exceptional member experiences every day.
Our network, technology platform, operational expertise and ambassadors have helped us build our trusted brand and an average 2022 Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) of 76. We use NPS to help measure our member experience and satisfaction. Our members know when they see the CLEAR brand to expect a frictionless, fast and secure experience. Similarly, our partners trust CLEAR to enable them to deliver the same frictionless, fast and easy experiences to their own customers. Both our members and partners are passionate about CLEAR.
Our business model is powered by network effects and characterized by efficient member acquisition and high member retention rates. Our largest CLEAR Plus member acquisition channel is in-airport (representing 66%, 58% and 69% of member acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively), where our prominent branding and expansive physical footprint allow prospective members to engage with CLEAR’s brand, ambassadors and technology firsthand. Our passionate member base further drives viral, word of mouth marketing and high annual member retention rates. As we add partners, products and locations, our platform becomes more valuable to our members. In turn, as we grow membership, our platform is more valuable to our existing and prospective partners. This is evident in our accelerated growth rate since inception—it took seven years to reach our first million members, but less than one year to reach each subsequent million members (we added approximately 5 million members in 2022 alone)—and our approximately 22 times Lifetime Value relative to our Customer Acquisition Cost for CLEAR Plus members who joined during 2022. For our definitions of “Lifetime Value” and “Customer Acquisition Cost” and information about how we calculate these metrics, see “—Our Member Acquisition and Retention Strategy.”
COVID-19
Beginning in early 2020, the COVID-19 global health pandemic had a significant and horrific impact on people’s health, safety, and economic well-being. It also had a material adverse impact on the global and domestic travel industries, resulting from government instituted legal restrictions on travel, shelter-in-place orders and mandated quarantine periods to 
prevent the spread of the disease. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations have been, and they may continue to be, adversely impacted.
We responded swiftly and aggressively to the COVID-19 operating environment by eliminating marketing spend and reducing operating expenses while caring for and supporting our team, our members and our partners. At the same time we accelerated investments in our platform, including our healthcare vertical, and developed our Health Pass product, which connects our members’ identity to a digital health credential, giving them control over and access to their healthcare information.
Despite 2021 Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) volume remaining approximately 30% below pre-pandemic travel, our 2021 Total Cumulative Enrollments increased 97.4% year-over-year to 10.4 million and we saw Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention increase to 92.3% (compared to 78.8% in 2020). While our Total Bookings increased 61.6% year-over-year, from $236.0 million to $341.0 million, we incurred net losses of $9.3 million and $115.1 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our total revenue increased 10.0% from $231.0 million in 2020 to $254.0 million in 2021. For our definitions of “Total Cumulative Enrollments,” “Annual CLEAR Plus Net Member Retention” and “Total Bookings” and information about how we calculate these metrics, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Key Performance Indicators.”
Our Network Effects
Our platform is multi-faceted and a powerful network of networks. We started in airports and witnessed accelerating member growth in both new markets and existing markets as our network expanded. Our largest CLEAR Plus member acquisition channel continues to be our in-airport channel. As we launched new use cases in existing markets, we saw accelerated growth and improved retention. The ability to use CLEAR in more locations in more ways increases our utility to our members. The larger our member base becomes, the more valuable our platform becomes to our current and prospective partners who utilize our platform to better realize their business objectives. As a result, our growth strategy is focused on simultaneously growing our CLEAR members while continuing to add valuable partners to our network and expanding the functionality and availability of our platform.
Our member base includes paying members and platform members. Paying members subscribe to our CLEAR Plus consumer aviation subscription service, which enables access to predictable and fast experiences through dedicated entry lanes in airport security checkpoints across the nation as well as access to our broader network. Our business model is powered by network effects and characterized by efficient member acquisition and high retention rates. Our passionate member base further drives viral, word of mouth marketing and high annual retention rates.
Platform members include members who enrolled through our mobile app, our partners’ customers who have enrolled through our Powered by CLEAR solutions, and formerly paying CLEAR Plus members. Platform members can use CLEAR anywhere in our network outside of our CLEAR Plus service. Typically new platform members are driven to enroll by one of our partners who integrate with CLEAR to enable frictionless experiences for their customers.
Our platform partners typically pay us based on the number of users or transaction volume. While contract structure may vary by use case, these deals are typically multi-year, recurring contracts that drive revenue primarily through transaction fees charged either per use or per user over a predefined time period, which sometimes includes tiered pricing. In addition, they may also include one-time implementation fees, licensing fees or incremental transaction fees. Revenues from our partners, and the percentage of our total revenue from these partners, have historically been immaterial. Although platform members may not contribute directly to our revenues, they are valuable to our platform as they indirectly contribute to revenues and drive new partners to CLEAR.
Platform members are also driven to enroll directly with CLEAR to access our expanding portfolio of use cases, including Health Pass (which includes validation of COVID testing results and digitization of vaccine status), Home to Gate (end-to-end frictionless travel journeys), venue access and Reserve Powered by CLEAR (virtual queuing).
We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our reach. We expect to expand CLEAR Plus through airport network expansion, increased market penetration in existing markets and new products in the aviation space. 
Additionally, we have a robust pipeline of new partners who increasingly recognize the need to deliver a fast, easy and secure experience to their customers—a true frictionless journey. Our secure identity platform can power a wide range of use cases such as customer check-in, digital identity, account opening/know your customer, virtual queuing, licensing and professional credential verification, and age verification. These use cases can be applied across verticals such as aviation and travel, hospitality, live sports and entertainment, healthcare, financial services and e-commerce, among others.
Our Offerings
Secure Identity Platform
Our secure identity platform is a multi-layered infrastructure consisting of both our front-end, including enrollment, verification and linking, and our robust, secure and scalable back-end. To interact with our platform, first time users go through our fast, secure, and easy enrollment process. Once a member is enrolled, each subsequent use of the platform to verify their identity is only a few simple steps. Our enroll once, verify everywhere approach benefits the entire CLEAR ecosystem by removing friction from members and increasing conversion for partners. 
CLEAR confirms identity on an opt-in basis using credential authentication (e.g., driver’s license, passport), best-of-breed biometric capture technology, liveness detection for anti-spoofing, biometric matching, backend identity proofing and other proprietary technologies to link an individual’s identity and their biometrics (e.g., eyes, face and fingerprints). Members can enroll in CLEAR in the manner which is most convenient for them: in-person enrollment pods in airports, or their own personal mobile device. 
Our platform is versatile, can be used across different verticals and can be customized for specific applications or use cases. Our architecture is designed to be scalable without compromising member experience or information security. We have built SDK and API capabilities to enable our partners to quickly and seamlessly integrate directly with our platform. This structure allows us to facilitate safer, faster and more frictionless experiences for our partners’ customers, while enabling our partners to continue to control and manage the direct relationship with their customer under their own brand.
We have a deep organizational commitment to preserving our members’ privacy and ensuring members have ultimate control of their personal information. This commitment has been core to our member pledge since our founding over 13 years ago. We have a comprehensive information security program and a robust cybersecurity posture that uses industry best practices with administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security, confidentiality or integrity of our platform’s systems and information. Our information security core tenets include the application of encryption at rest and in transit, firewalls, multi-factor authentication, granular role-based access control, physical and personnel security (including training), intrusion detection and data loss prevention. We have a commitment to members being in control of their own information and never sell member data.
We have been certified at the highest level of security by our government regulators. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has certified CLEAR’s information security program at a FISMA High Rating (the highest designation according to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act).
Consumer Subscription Service
CLEAR Plus
CLEAR Plus is our consumer aviation subscription service, which enables access to predictable and fast experiences through dedicated entry lanes in airport security checkpoints across the nation as well as access to our broader network. With CLEAR Plus, members use our touchless biometric verification technology to validate their identity and travel credentials. Our team of hospitality and security focused ambassadors help bring our technology to life by delivering a frictionless journey alongside excellent service. CLEAR Plus currently retails for $189 per year per member and is billed upfront. We offer free trials in-airport and online and promotional pricing to select partners including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines frequent fliers, as well as a family plan for up to three household members at an additional $60 per year per family member. Through our partnership with American Express, eligible cardmembers receive statement credits for all or a portion of their CLEAR Plus membership. We also offer discounted military, government and student pricing and children under 18 can use CLEAR Plus for free with an adult member.
TSA PreCheck® Application Program
In January 2020, we were selected by TSA as an awardee in the TSA Biometric PreCheck® Expansion Services and Vetting Program. As part of our agreement with TSA, we will leverage our marketing expertise, operational footprint and ambassador network to handle subscription renewal processing and new enrollments for the TSA PreCheck® program, as well as offer a CLEAR/TSA PreCheck® bundled subscription for customers who are new to both CLEAR and to TSA PreCheck®. We will provide the ability to renew TSA PreCheck® memberships on our website and complete new enrollments in-airport through our ambassador network.
On December 21, 2022, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) issued an authority to operate (“ATO”) to CLEAR for TSA PreCheck® Enrollment Provided by CLEAR, and we expect to begin enrolling travelers in TSA PreCheck® in early 2023. The TSA PreCheck® Enrollment Provided by CLEAR program will represent a new source of revenue and members. We believe that approximately 56% of CLEAR Plus members are verifying with TSA PreCheck®, and that there is a significant opportunity for us to process their TSA PreCheck® membership renewals. In addition, we believe we can add a large number of new TSA PreCheck® subscribers on behalf of TSA. After a new TSA PreCheck® 
customer is enrolled or renewed, we will offer the customer an opportunity to enroll in CLEAR on an opt-in basis. We believe CLEAR Plus and TSA PreCheck® are highly complementary services and this channel is relevant to showcase not only the TSA PreCheck® value proposition, but also the power of the combination and the extension of a holistic Home to Gate travel journey. The partnership does not extend to performing physical security screening, which continues to be operated by TSA. 
Nationwide Physical Network
We have built an extensive physical footprint with a nationwide network of use cases including airports, stadiums and businesses to offer members frictionless, trusted experiences as they move and transact throughout the day in both physical and digital environments. As of December 31, 2022, members can access our nationwide network of 48 airports covering 132 lanes, 16 sports and entertainment partners with priority lanes, and a growing list of B2B partners. The continued expansion of our partnerships enable our partners to integrate with CLEAR and our members to use CLEAR in new places and in new ways.
Each CLEAR location utilizes one or more of our physical or digital offerings, which may include owned or leased hardware. Many CLEAR locations, for example at airports, also include designated entry lanes for CLEAR members. These locations are staffed by our team of approximately 2,800 part-time and full-time hospitality and security focused ambassadors and field managers. Our ambassadors are a hospitality and security focused labor force that deliver the frictionless CLEAR experience every day to our partners and members. Our ambassadors facilitate a predictable and smooth CLEAR experience for existing members, enroll new members, and help bring our platform to life.
Mobile
We also engage with our members via the flagship CLEAR mobile app. It's used to enroll new members and improve the experience for existing members. The app has several features, including:
•Enroll in CLEAR and manage your membership—enrolling as a CLEAR member is a quick and easy process that can be handled directly through the CLEAR app via facial biometric recognition technology and validating a government-issued identification. This one-time enrollment can be completed in minutes and gives members access to our platform offerings and an easy upgrade path to CLEAR Plus at our airport locations.
•Home to Gate—members can have a predictable day-of-travel experience by inputting their flight number to access helpful information to assist their journey from the time they leave their home until they board the plane. Home to Gate integrates flight departure times, traffic data, security screening, gate number and terminal walking times to their exact gate. Our integration with Uber allows customers to book a car to depart at the right time for a seamless travel journey. Additional services can be easily integrated into this platform.
•Credentials, which allow members access to unique experiences by verifying their identity and health attributes such as our Health Pass product which validates COVID-19 test results, vaccination status, and health screening responses.
•Touchless Access to select partner services and venues, such as airport lounges and event venues.
Reserve Powered by CLEAR
Reserve Powered by CLEAR is a virtual queuing technology that provides users with the choice of how they queue - either at home or on the move. The technology can be accessed through web, mobile, or web-app technology. Users can see the live wait-times, enter into the queue remotely or pre-book their appointment, and let the software wait on their behalf.
Our Value Proposition to Members and Partners
For our members, we have built a consumer-centric user experience that helps create frictionless experiences. We started with their travel journey and are expanding into their daily interactions in the physical and digital worlds. For our partners, we believe our rapidly expanding membership base and our platform strengthens their relationships and can elevate the experience they deliver daily to their customers and employees.
Why Our Members Love Us
We are obsessed with our members’ experience and seek to continually enhance the value we deliver to them through our platform as reflected by our strong member growth and our average 2022 NPS score of 76.We provide the following key benefits to our members:
•We seek to transform manual experiences into seamless end-to-end journeys: We are committed to making our members’ lives safer and easier. Our platform and dedicated team of ambassadors help to transform inconvenient and often stressful consumer experiences into effortless journeys. Our goal is for CLEAR to instill a feeling of being cared for, of being seen, and of feeling safe with predictable, secure and seamless experiences.
•We expand how and where our members can use CLEAR: As of December 31, 2022, members can access our nationwide network of 48 airports covering 132 lanes, 16 sports and entertainment partners with priority lanes, and our growing B2B partners. We continue to expand our partnerships and seek to establish new partners to enable members to use our platform in new places and in new ways.
•We invest in innovation: We are focused on innovating both our product and our platform to improve our members’ experience, improve safety and security and introduce new use cases. For example, to complement our CLEAR Plus airport security checkpoint offering, we developed a portfolio of mobile applications including Home to Gate and the acquisition of Whyline, Inc. our virtual queuing technology used for Reserve Powered by CLEAR. We continue to improve our mobile enrollment experience and have upgraded our APIs and enrollment capacity to support our growth. We intend to accelerate our pace of innovation to add more features and use cases, to ultimately deliver greater value to our members.
•Our ambassadors bring CLEAR to life for our members: Our passionate team of approximately 2,800 part-time and full-time nationwide CLEAR ambassadors and field managers enhance our members’ experience and in many instances bring our technology to life. They provide on-location high-touch sales and marketing support which enables new members to enroll and existing members to use our platform with comfort and ease. They also educate our members about our technology, security and privacy.
•Trust and privacy are the foundation of CLEAR: We have been certified at the highest level of security by our government regulators. The DHS has certified our information security program at a FISMA High Rating (the highest designation according to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act). Our members provide us with their personal information on an opt-in basis with the understanding that their information is secure and will never be sold.
Why Our Partners Love Us
Our platform is designed to enable our partners to further their business objectives, better serve their customers’ needs and elevate their customers’ experiences. By transforming the end-to-end consumer journey, we believe CLEAR enables our partners to capture not just a greater share of their customers’ wallet, but a greater share of their overall lives. We benefit our partners in a variety of ways, including:
•We are a committed partner for innovation: Partners turn to us to help them deliver safer, faster and easier experiences to their customers, who have increasingly high expectations for seamless end-to-end journeys. We provide flexibility for them to do so within their own branded solutions through our SDK and API integrations or directly with CLEAR.
•We have a large, highly engaged and growing CLEAR member base: We have over 15 million CLEAR members, many of whom are frequent travelers and active consumers. Many of our members are also core customers of our partners. Other members can opt-in to a relationship with our partners. As our embedded base of members grow, our partners will benefit from our reach by accelerated adoption rates and economies of scale.
•Our brand is trusted: We have built a trusted consumer brand with passionate members. We believe our recognized and trusted brand, which is known for innovation and exceptional member experiences, gives our partners confidence that we will enhance and elevate their own customers’ experience.
•Security is paramount: Security is our core competency. We have a deep organizational commitment to securing data and protecting member privacy and a robust cyber-security posture. Data protection and privacy are complex and our partners rely on us to fulfill this requirement on their behalf.
•We significantly benefit the airport communities in which we operate: CLEAR becomes ingrained in the fabric of the local communities where we operate through the engagement of our members, and we believe we make a significant positive economic contribution. CLEAR creates job opportunities where we invest in the learning and development of our local employees and seek to develop partnerships which are mutually beneficial for us, our partners and the community.
•We operate our own direct-to-consumer offering, creating strong alignment with our partners: We have over 13 years of experience operating CLEAR Plus, our owned and operated consumer subscription service. As we invest in our platform to enhance the CLEAR Plus member experience, our partners benefit from these enhancements. 
We believe this creates natural alignment with our partners and makes us a trusted and forward-thinking partner to them.
Our Member Acquisition and Retention Strategy
We have focused our member acquisition strategy around delivering exceptional experiences to build brand trust as well as driving network effects by adding new partners, products and locations to increase our value proposition.
Our largest CLEAR Plus member acquisition channel is our highly efficient in-airport channel, where our prominent branding and expansive physical footprint allows prospective members to engage with CLEAR’s brand, ambassadors and technology firsthand. Our passionate member base drives viral, word of mouth marketing and high levels of retention. To ensure best-in-class member service we monitor real-time member feedback and quickly take action on information-driven insights. As we add new airport and non-airport locations (such as live sports and entertainment venues), the power of network effects makes CLEAR Plus more valuable to our members, further driving new member acquisition and higher member retention. We also entered into strategic distribution partnerships with partners such as Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Express that promote our services to their customers on a discounted or subsidized basis which allows us to efficiently scale membership in CLEAR Plus.
CLEAR also offers services that are free to members, both directly and under agreements with our partners who typically pay us based on the number of members or transaction volume. New platform members are largely driven to our platform by one of our partners who integrate with CLEAR to enable frictionless experiences for their customers. These partnerships allow us to scale our use cases and membership, which enhances the value of our network, and earn revenue from platform members.
Our expanding portfolio of use cases attracts new platform members directly to our platform and creates enhanced value for our CLEAR Plus members. As a result, we expect our platform member acquisition costs to remain low. Today these include Health Pass (which includes validation of COVID testing results and digitization of vaccine status) and Home to Gate (end-to-end frictionless travel journeys), and in the future will also include Reserve Powered by CLEAR (virtual queuing). Certain platform members may wish to upgrade to CLEAR Plus, further driving our revenues.
Over time, as we continue to grow platform members, potentially at faster rates than paying members, we expect to see growth in Total Cumulative Enrollments and Total Cumulative Platform Uses per Total Cumulative Enrollments as well as a decrease in revenue per Total Cumulative Enrollments accompanied by a commensurate decline in the cost to acquire an incremental Total Cumulative Enrollment. We believe this dynamic will grow the long-term economic value of our platform by increasing total engagement, expanding our margins and maximizing our revenue.
We measure our CLEAR Plus member Lifetime Value and Customer Acquisition Cost in an effort to measure the efficiency of our member acquisition and retention strategy. Lifetime Value is calculated by estimating the cumulative dollar contribution over the estimated lifetime of a CLEAR Plus member. To estimate retention rates we use CLEAR Plus Member Retention across annual cohorts in 2022. We estimate the dollar contribution as the annual revenue per member less estimated direct costs to service that member including revenue share, credit card fees, and member service expense to process that member in a CLEAR lane. Customer Acquisition Cost is calculated by dividing total 2022 airport-related marketing spend, inclusive of commissions, by total new paying CLEAR Plus members who joined during 2022. On this basis, we achieved a Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost ratio of approximately 22 times for members who joined during 2022.
Our Competitive Advantages
Trusted and Extensible Brand with Passionate Member Base
From our founding, we have been obsessed with the CLEAR member experience. We have been expanding our network, investing in our technology platform, strengthening our operations and developing our people to consistently deliver increased value to members and partners, resulting in our trusted and valued brand. Our passionate member base drives viral, word of mouth marketing and high annual retention rates. This is evident in our accelerated growth rate since inception and our approximately 22 times Lifetime Value relative to our Customer Acquisition Cost for CLEAR Plus members who joined during 2022. It took seven years to reach our first million members, but less than one year to reach each subsequent million members (we added approximately 5 million members in 2022 alone). Our strong brand has enabled our expansion into new markets such as live sports and entertainment venues as well as digital health.
Operational Expertise at Scale
Today, our owned and operated businesses such as CLEAR Plus and mobile applications are the largest users of our platform. Operating and scaling our own consumer-facing service, CLEAR Plus, over the past 13 years has given us experience and capabilities that are hard to replicate, and an environment for innovation that benefits all of our partners. We have significant expertise implementing and seamlessly operating our platform’s combination of pod hardware, 
biometric technology and physical human interactions across 64 regulated or complex environments, such as airports and live sporting events. We also manage a growing ambassador and field manager part-time and full-time workforce of approximately 2,800 who are deployed across our expansive network of locations to implement our platform and continue to build our brand reputation. We combine our on-the-ground operational expertise with strong customer acquisition and retention, digital marketing, software and mobile application development and cybersecurity capabilities.
Platform Originated in High Security Aviation Environment
We started in aviation security, a regulated environment requiring a robust physical and information security posture. By building our platform in this context, we invested in, and were held accountable for, industry leading security, scalability and reliability. Our comprehensive information security program uses industry best practices with administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security, confidentiality or integrity of CLEAR systems and information. We are certified as Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (“SAFETY Act”) and FISMA High Rating compliant which governs requirements for protecting sensitive data by the DHS. We continue to operate in aviation security today, and we use a single platform across all our use cases, both for our owned and operated businesses, such as CLEAR Plus, and for the experiences offered by our partners. As such, we bring our high standards of security, scalability, and reliability to every environment in which members engage with CLEAR.
Innovative and Scalable Platform
We believe that the significant investments we have made in our technology platform are a key differentiator for our business. Our approximately 270 person technology team leads platform innovation inside CLEAR. We have spent more than 13 years to create our scalable and secure back-end and our easy-to-use consumer front-end. The scalability of our platform is demonstrated by our ability to quickly launch new features. For example, in 2022 we built a web experience that can be embedded into a partners native ecosystem so the partner can leverage our verification and enrollment technology. This web experience allows partners to use CLEAR's technology to verify their customers identities and provide friction-free experiences like account creation, login, age verification.
Powerful Network Effects
The power of network effects on our business model became evident as we added additional locations and our membership growth accelerated. Given the lengthy airport sales cycle and scarcity of airport real estate, it took us seven years to build a critical mass of airports to attract the first million members. Once we achieved this scale, the power of national network effects began to take hold. As the likelihood that a domestic traveler would have access to a CLEAR lane increased, the value proposition of our CLEAR Plus offering increased substantially. In 2015, we embarked on a strategy to add additional local CLEAR lanes at stadiums and live entertainment venues. This strategy created a second local network effect, increasing the value proposition of CLEAR Plus within a given city and meaningfully improving our member retention. The combination of these two powerful network effects drives both member growth and retention which we believe ultimately fuels our revenue growth. Over the past six years, our strategy expanded as our platform’s capabilities have evolved. Our investment in our platform and products and the expanding scale of our membership have accelerated the addition of new partners that are further accelerating our membership growth and increasing verifications.
Attractive Growth While Maintaining Disciplined Capital Allocation
We have consistently focused on growth by investing in our secure identity platform, expanding our nationwide network and partnerships, adding talented team members and continuing to innovate. We are disciplined capital allocators and have achieved our current scale on net invested capital of approximately $50 million. Our business model is powered by network effects and characterized by efficient member acquisition and high retention rates. Our largest CLEAR Plus member acquisition channel is in-airport (representing 66%, 58% and 69% of member acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively), where our prominent branding and expansive physical footprint allow prospective members to engage with CLEAR’s brand, ambassadors and technology firsthand. As we add partners, products and locations, our platform becomes more valuable to our members. This is evident by our approximately 22 times Lifetime Value relative to our Customer Acquisition Cost for CLEAR Plus members who joined during 2022. For our definitions of “Lifetime Value” and “Customer Acquisition Cost” and information about how we calculate these metrics, see “—Our Member Acquisition and Retention Strategy.”
Led by Experienced, Visionary Team
CLEAR was founded in 2010 by Caryn Seidman-Becker, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kenneth Cornick, our President and Chief Financial Officer. CLEAR is still executing on the original vision today, with Ms. Seidman-Becker and Mr. Cornick continuing to lead the business 13 years later. They are substantial owners of CLEAR and operate the business with the goal of long-term value creation. Ms. Seidman-Becker’s and Mr. Cornick’s prior 
investment experience informs their efficient capital allocation strategy, and they have attracted a deeply experienced team to accelerate CLEAR’s next phase of growth.
Our Growth Strategies 
We have a significant track record of member growth within our domestic aviation vertical, and our platform has numerous adjacencies for further expansion.
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Grow CLEAR Plus Members: We see growth opportunities in our CLEAR Plus member base. We believe we can continue to open CLEAR lanes in new airports and new CLEAR lanes in our existing airports. As of December 31, 2022, our airport coverage is approximately 60% of 2022 TSA checkpoint volume. In December 2022, approximately 6% of all TSA checkpoint volume went through a CLEAR lane, compared to approximately 4% in December 2021. We also believe there are opportunities to continue to develop new features such as bag drop to improve the member and partner experience.
•Launch TSA PreCheck® enrollment program: We believe our TSA PreCheck® enrollment award will drive significant growth for TSA’s program and a meaningful incremental revenue opportunity to CLEAR as we manage renewal processing and new enrollments for TSA PreCheck® subscriptions. Our TSA PreCheck® award also offers a significant top-of-funnel opportunity to acquire new CLEAR Plus members as we intend to offer a CLEAR/TSA PreCheck® bundled product for customers who are new to both CLEAR and to TSA PreCheck®.
•Expand our partnerships and distribution channels: We intend to continue to pursue commercial partners as a means to broaden our distribution channel reach and accelerate member growth. These partnerships and channels are likely to include new airlines, credit card partners, professional sports leagues and teams, digital marketplaces and retail enterprises.
•Expand into new verticals and products: We have already made significant progress expanding from aviation into select new verticals, including travel and hospitality, live sports and entertainment and healthcare. We plan to continue investing in each of these verticals to increase the growth of our platform, member base and our network locations where our members can use and our partners can integrate with CLEAR. We believe we have a proven platform business with numerous natural adjacencies and as our member base and product portfolio grows, we believe we will have the opportunity to grow into new verticals. This portfolio may include payments, location access, ticketing, age validation and health profiles. 
•Acquisitions and corporate development opportunities: We may opportunistically pursue selective acquisitions and other corporate development opportunities to complement our existing platform capabilities and further accelerate our growth and platform adoption. In 2021, we acquired Whyline, Inc., a provider of virtual queuing and appointment technology, and Atlas Certified, an automated solution to verify professional licenses and certification data across industries.
•International expansion: Our platform is highly scalable and can be rapidly deployed in new markets. We believe that there is likely to be global demand for our secure identity platform. While in the near-term the North American market remains our highest priority, through our December 2021 acquisition of Whyline, Inc. we now provide services to partners across international markets including Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Spain, Canada, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. 
Competition
We compete for both our members and our partners. The market in which we operate is highly fragmented and characterized by high growth, shifting user preferences, and introductions of new services and offerings. Our primary competitors are offline alternatives, including manual security checks and screening processes. These alternatives tend to be costly and involve significant manpower, time and resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Brand and Operations—We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors.”
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
Our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions, non-disclosure agreements, assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights with employees, contractors, and other third parties to establish and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we have 47 issued United States patents (with six additional patents allowed) and 63 patent applications pending in the United States relating to certain aspects of our technology. We also have a limited number of patents issued and patent applications filed in other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2032 and 2041. As of December 31, 2022, we have three U.S. registered trademarks, and six trademark applications pending in the United States. These include registrations for the CLEAR name and other brand indicia. We also have registered the domain name www.clearme.com, and similar variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, deemed unenforceable or otherwise challenged. Further, even if we are successful in legal proceedings, unauthorized third parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology or infringe our copyrights and trademark rights. In addition, should we expand, the laws of various foreign countries where we may expand may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.
Companies engaged in related businesses or even unrelated businesses may have patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights which such companies may assert are infringed by our technology or business activities. From time to time, we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. Should our business continue to grow, we will likely face more claims of infringement by third parties. We may become party to patent infringement claims and other intellectual property litigation and legal proceedings, all of which can be expensive and time consuming, and if resolved adverse to the Company, could have a significant impact on our business. See “—Legal Proceedings” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property.”
Employees
Our organization’s core values are:
•Embrace Change: Our growth requires that we embrace change. We pivot to overcome roadblocks and we are transparent on why decisions are made.
•Own It: CLEAR is an organization of doers. We own it by solving problems even if they “aren’t ours to solve” and commit to seeing them all the way through.
•Great People: From our ambassadors in the field, to our corporate team members, people are at the heart of all that we do.
•Obsessed with Member Experience: We are obsessed with our member experience. We love hearing from our members so that we can continuously improve and come back better for them every day.
•Speak Up: We believe in challenging fearlessly and embracing the brutal truth. We speak up by displaying honesty to our members, our team members, and ourselves.
•Indefatigable: We tirelessly pursue our goals with passion and sometimes “no” simply means “not yet.”
•Bias for Action: We encourage our team members to have a bias for action, using data to make calculated decisions. We have confidence in our decisions and learn from our mistakes.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,056 full-time employees with our largest workforces in New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta. We compete to attract and retain diverse and highly talented individuals, particularly people with expertise in engineering, product development and marketing. Our ability to recruit talent benefits from our unique workplace culture and brand. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Government Regulation 
Data and Privacy
Our business is subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations pertain to matters including but not limited to, the collection and use of biometric or health information, data privacy and information protection, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer contracting and others, and are often complex and subject to varying interpretations. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies. For example, California has passed a comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and other states including Virginia and Colorado have also passed 
similar laws. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) took effect on January 1, 2023. CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights procedures and obligations, limitations on data uses and new audit requirements. Further, there are several legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new privacy and security obligations. Certain states have laws that specifically regulate the collection and use of biometric information, such as Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), and numerous states and municipalities are considering similar legislation. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—Any actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws relating to privacy and data protection may result in significant liability, negative publicity and erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) impose specific requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of sensitive patient health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates.” See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—We function as a HIPAA “business associate” for certain of our health care partners and, as such, are subject to strict privacy and data security requirements. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we could be subject to significant liability, which can adversely affect our business as well as our ability to attract and retain new members and their utilization of our platform.”
International Operations
As we expand internationally we become subject to the regulatory regimes in other countries in which we operate, which may be equally or more complex. For example, through our December 2021 acquisition of Whyline, Inc., we now provide services to partners across international markets including Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Spain, Canada, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, and are subject to the regulatory regimes in these countries as well. 
In addition, as we expand in Europe we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). GDPR took effect in May 2018 and includes operational requirements for companies that are established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or process personal data of individuals located in the EEA. These requirements govern the processing of personal data and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, the United Kingdom has transposed GDPR into domestic law with a United Kingdom version of GDPR (combining GDPR and the Data Protection Act of 2018) that took effect in January 2021, which exposes us to two parallel regimes, each of which authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law took effect in August 2020 and imposes requirements similar to GDPR. 
Aviation
Our airport operations are subject to standards promulgated by the federal government related to aviation security. These standards pertain to items such as checkpoint operations, enrollment and verification processes, employee hiring and training and information technology. We operate through the Registered Traveler Program according to guidelines set forth by the federal government which in some cases are overseen directly by the federal government and in some cases are overseen indirectly through our airport or airline partners. As we have grown, our regulatory frameworks have evolved as well. For example, as a result of our accelerated addition of new airport locations and offering of new functionality at airports (such as our biometric boarding pass service), we are subject to various audits, reviews and evaluations overseen by TSA, a sub-agency of the DHS. The DHS has certified our information security program at a FISMA High Rating (the highest designation according to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act). In addition, the system we use for the Registered Traveler program (“Registered Traveler Program”) and similar programs has been certified by the DHS as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology under the SAFETY Act. The SAFETY Act provides important legal liability protections for providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services. Under the SAFETY Act, technology providers may apply to the DHS for coverage of the products and services. If granted coverage, such providers receive certain legal protections against product liability, professional liability and certain other claims that could arise following an act of terrorism. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—We must continue to meet the standards set for our airport operations by governmental stakeholders” and “—Liability protections provided by the SAFETY Act may be limited.”
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section of this annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (“Annual Report on Form 10-K”) for information regarding how actions by governmental stakeholders and regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.
Corporate History
The Company (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, ”CLEAR,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is a holding company and its principal asset is the controlling equity interest in Alclear Holdings, LLC (“Alclear”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company, which was formed in connection with our initial public offering (“IPO”), was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 2, 2021, and Alclear was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on January 21, 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement dated June 29, 2021 (the “Operating Agreement”), as the sole managing member of Alclear, the Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Alclear, and through Alclear and its subsidiaries, conducts the Company’s business.
The Reorganization Transactions
Prior to the completion of our IPO, we consummated an internal reorganization, which we refer to as the “reorganization transactions.” Prior to the commencement of the reorganization transactions, Alclear had limited liability company interests outstanding in the form of Class A units, Class B units and profit units. Prior to the consummation of the reorganization transactions and our IPO, all of Alclear’s outstanding equity interests, including its Class A units, Class B units and profit units, were owned by the following persons, whom we refer to collectively as the “CLEAR Pre-IPO Members”:
•Alclear Investments, LLC, an entity controlled by Ms. Seidman-Becker, which we refer to as “Alclear Investments”;
•Alclear Investments II, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Cornick, which we refer to as “Alclear Investments II” and which we refer to collectively with Alclear Investments as the “Founder Post-IPO Members”;
•our other pre-IPO investors, including certain strategic alliance partners; and
•certain of our current and former employees, members of management, service providers and members of the board of managers of Alclear.
Prior to the reorganization transactions, Alclear made a distribution of an immaterial amount to certain CLEAR Pre-IPO Members for the purpose of funding their tax obligations for periods prior to the pricing of our IPO. In connection with the reorganization transactions, the following steps occurred:
•we became the sole managing member of Alclear;
•certain warrants of Alclear exercisable prior to our IPO, to the extent not exercised by the holders thereof at their discretion, were automatically exercised for Class B units of Alclear;
•we amended and restated Alclear’s Operating Agreement and provided that, among other things, all of Alclear’s outstanding equity interests, including its Class A units, Class B units and profit units (including unvested time-based profit units), be reclassified into non-voting common units (“Alclear Units”). The number of Alclear Units issued to each member of Alclear was determined based on a hypothetical liquidation of Alclear and the initial public offering price per share of our Class A Common Stock (as defined below) in our IPO, as well as a unit split to optimize the Company’s capital structure to facilitate our IPO;
•we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation (as amended and restated, “Certificate of Incorporation”) and are authorized to issue four classes of common stock: Class A common stock, $0.00001 par value per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), Class B common stock, $0.00001 par value per share (the “Class B Common Stock”), Class C common stock, $0.00001 par value per share (the “Class C Common Stock”) and Class D common stock, $0.00001 par value per share (the “Class D Common Stock” and, collectively with the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, the “Common Stock”). The Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock each provides holders with one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, and the Class B Common Stock and Class D Common Stock each provides holders with 20 votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The holders of Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock do not have any of the economic rights (including rights to dividends and distributions upon liquidation) provided to holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. These attributes are summarized in the following table:

Class of Common Stock | Votes | Economic Rights
Class A Common Stock | 1 | Yes 
Class B Common Stock | 20 | Yes 
Class C Common Stock | 1 | No 
Class D Common Stock | 20 | No 

Shares of our Common Stock generally vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders;
•certain other warrants of Alclear were either, in accordance with their terms, (i) exchanged for new warrants representing the right to receive Class A Common Stock or (ii) remained at Alclear and continue to be exercisable for Alclear Units;
•Founder Post-IPO Members contributed a portion of their Alclear Units to the Company in exchange for Class B Common Stock;
•certain CLEAR Pre-IPO Members contributed their Alclear Units to the Company in exchange for Class A Common Stock;
•outstanding restricted stock units and unvested performance-based profit units in Alclear were substituted with restricted stock units representing the right to receive our Class A Common Stock following the applicable vesting date;
•we formed subsidiaries that merged with and into certain entities that were treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain CLEAR Pre-IPO Members held interests (the “Blocker Corporations” and the CLEAR Pre-IPO Members who held interests in the Blocker Corporations, the “Blocker Stockholders”), and the surviving entities then merged with and into the Company. We refer to these transactions as the “Mergers.” As consideration for the Mergers, we issued to the Blocker Stockholders shares of our Class A Common Stock. We refer to the Blocker Stockholders as the “Blocker Post-IPO Stockholders” and the Blocker Post-IPO Stockholders and the Other Post-IPO Stockholders collectively as the “Investor Post-IPO Stockholders.” The number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued to the Blocker Post-IPO Stockholders was based on the number of Alclear Units that we acquired;
•the CLEAR Post-IPO Members subscribed for and purchased shares of our Common Stock as follows, in each case at a purchase price of $0.00001 per share and in an amount equal to the number of Alclear Units held by each such CLEAR Post-IPO Member:
◦Alclear Investments purchased 19,630,246 shares of our Class D Common Stock;
◦Alclear Investments II purchased 7,079,575 shares of our Class D Common Stock; and
•the other CLEAR Post-IPO Members purchased an aggregate of 44,598,167 shares of our Class C Common Stock; and
•subject to certain restrictions, the Founder Post-IPO Members were granted the right to exchange their Alclear Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class D Common Stock, for, at our option, (i) shares of our Class B Common Stock or (ii) cash from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale of Class A Common Stock (based on the market price of our Class A Common Stock in such public offering or private sale), and the other CLEAR Post-IPO Members were granted the right to exchange their Alclear Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class C Common Stock, for, at our option, (i) shares of our Class A Common Stock or (ii) cash from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale of Class A Common Stock (based on the market price of our Class A Common Stock in such public offering or private sale). Each share of our Class B Common Stock and Class D Common Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, respectively. Furthermore, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, each share of our Class B Common Stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A Common Stock and each share of our Class D Common Stock will automatically convert into one share of our Class C Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain events as described in Exhibit 4.1—“Description of Capital Stock—Common Stock—Conversion, Transferability and Exchange.”
