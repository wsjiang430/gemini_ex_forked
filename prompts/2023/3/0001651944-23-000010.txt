 Item 1. Business
Unless specifically noted otherwise, as used throughout this Business section, “we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company” refers to the business, operations and financial results of DermTech Operations prior to, and the Company and its subsidiaries subsequent to, the completion of the Business Combination as the context requires. “Constellation” refers to the Company prior to the completion of the Business Combination.
Business Overview
We are a molecular diagnostic company developing and marketing novel non-invasive genomics tests to aid in the diagnosis and management of skin cancer, inflammatory skin diseases, and aging-related skin conditions. Our technology enhances early melanoma detection by non-invasively detecting genomic markers associated with melanoma to identify higher risk lesions at their earliest stages to rule out melanoma with a greater than 99% negative predictive value ("NPV") (Gerami et al. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2017; Skelsey et al. SKIN. 2021). Our scalable genomics assays have been designed to work with our adhesive patch, the DermTech Smart StickerTM (the “Smart Sticker”) which is used to non-invasively collect skin tissue samples for analysis.
Our first commercial test addresses unmet needs in the diagnostic pathway of pigmented skin lesions, dark-colored patches of skin often referred to as moles. Our DermTech Melanoma Test (the “DMT”) facilitates the clinical assessment of pigmented skin lesions that raise the concern for melanoma. We have marketed this test directly to a broad group of dermatology clinicians. The simple application of Smart Stickers to collect samples non-invasively may also allow us to market the DermTech Melanoma Test more broadly to primary care physicians and through telemedicine channels. We process our tests in our high complexity molecular laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”), accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), and licensed by the State of California as well as other states requiring out-of-state licensure, including New York. We also provide laboratory services to several pharmaceutical companies that access our technology on a contract basis typically related to ongoing clinical trials or other studies to advance therapeutics. 
Our Business
We are a molecular diagnostic company developing and marketing novel non-invasive genomics tests that seek to transform the practice of dermatology. Our platform may change the diagnostic paradigm in dermatology from one that is subjective, invasive, less accurate and higher-cost, to one that is objective, non-invasive, more accurate and lower-cost. Our initial focus is skin cancer. We currently offer the DMT, which is an innovative, non-invasive way to enhance melanoma detection with a greater than 99 percent negative predictive value and are developing a product for non-melanoma skin cancers. We are also working on products to assess precancerous genomic changes associated with UV sun exposure. Our scalable genomics platform has been designed to work with our Smart Sticker, which provides an easily and non-invasively way to collect skin sample, in contrast to the existing standard of care of using a scalpel to biopsy suspicious lesions. We also provide our research services and technology platform on a contract basis to pharmaceutical companies that may use the technology to support their clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies use our Smart Sticker to test for the existence of genomic targets of various skin diseases and measure the response of drugs under development. We process our tests in our CLIA-certified commercial laboratory, which is also CAP accredited and licensed by the California Department of Public Health as well as other states that require out-of-state licensure. As described below, our technology platform is easy to use and integrates seamlessly into the current clinical diagnostic pathway by providing (i) simple and rapid tissue collection and shipping via standard express mail, (ii) sample processing via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (“qPCR”), DNA

sequencing or assays and (iii) results are reported to a physician within 5 business days from receipt of the sample in the laboratory. 
Dermatology is one of the largest medical markets in the United States. The skin cancer segment has over 15 million surgical diagnostic procedures performed each year, with an average annual spend of $8.1 billion, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (“AAD”). Current dermatologic diagnosis is primarily based on subjective visual assessments and subsequent surgical diagnostic procedures. This legacy paradigm is prone to error and results in a substantial number of unnecessary and invasive surgical procedures. Our platform provides a non-invasive alternative that minimizes patient discomfort, scarring, and risk of infection. Further, because our testing results utilize genomic analysis, we provide more accurate, objective diagnostic information than the currently prevailing diagnostic procedures. As described below, a study published in JAMA Dermatology demonstrated that the foundational assay of the DMT lowers the cost to diagnose melanoma while providing a more accurate and less invasive alternative to current methods used to evaluate lesions suspicious for melanoma (Hornberger and Siegel. JAMA Dermatol. 2018), providing a test that assesses genomic atypia for key genomic markers, and that has been demonstrated to rule-out melanoma with a greater than 99% negative predictive value.
The healthcare market is saturated with genomic tests that are primarily marketed to pathology and oncology specialists. We are the first company to offer non-invasive genomic tests to the clinical dermatology market. We believe our technology platform may expand the base of clinicians (e.g. primary care clinicians) that can incorporate our test to enhance the practice of precision dermatology. As healthcare delivery diverges to support more convenient delivery models, such as pharmacy-based/retail clinics and telemedicine, we believe our platform may facilitate the migration of dermatologic care to these alternative models. We also believe our platform may allow for expanded consumer-based sample collection shipped directly to our laboratory, positively impacting the ease of use and convenience of providing dermatologic care.
We originally marketed the DMT under the name Pigmented Lesion Assay or PLA. The PLA assessed pigmented skin lesions, moles or dark skin spots and enhances early detection of melanoma. In particular, the PLA detected expression of the LINC00518 (“LINC”) and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (“PRAME”) genes using a nucleic acid amplification process called reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (“RT-PCR”). In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced our Nevome product, an adjunctive reflex test for the PLA. The Nevome test was used with histopathology to identify additional risk factors for melanoma and to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma in PLA positive tests, which are subjected to surgical biopsy. The Nevome test analyzed early-stage melanoma driver mutations in the v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (“BRAF”), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (“NRAS”) and TERT genes. The Nevome test utilized the same genomic material collected from the initial Smart Sticker sample used for the PLA and did not require additional sampling. 
Table of Contents

We discontinued our Nevome product in November 2020, and introduced our second-generation test in 2021 as an add-on assay to PLA, which is designed to identify the presence of mutations in TERT gene promoter region using DNA sequencing (Jackson et al. SKIN. 2020). We have since branded the PLA and TERT add-on-assay as the DMT. The DMT may be ordered with or without the add-on test for TERT. Positive results for LINC, PRAME or TERT correlate with a lesion at higher risk for melanoma. If none of the biomarkers are detected, this result indicates a greater than 99% probability that the tested mole is not melanoma.
In March 2019, Medicare’s Molecular Diagnostic Services program, administered by Palmetto GBA (“MolDX”), which performs technology assessments for genomic tests, issued a favorable Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) draft (the “Draft LCD”) for the DMT (without the TERT assay). Each reference to the DMT in this paragraph refers only to the DMT without the TERT assay. The TERT assay has not yet been submitted for evaluation under MolDX and is not covered by Medicare. In October 2019, the American Medical Association (“AMA”) provided us with a Current Procedural Technology Proprietary Laboratory Analysis code of 0089U (the “PLA Code”). Pricing of $760 for the PLA Code was published on December 24, 2019 as part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) for 2020, which has been confirmed for 2023. The Medicare final LCD (the “Final LCD”) first made available on December 26, 2019 expanded the coverage from the Draft LCD from one test per date of service to two tests per date of service for a certain percentage of patients, and is indicated only for use on pigmented lesion for which a diagnosis of melanoma is being considered. Also, the test may only be ordered by clinicians who evaluate pigmented lesions and perform biopsies. The test is covered for use as a source of information on whether or not to perform a biopsy. Our local Medicare Administrative Contractor, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC (“Noridian”) relies upon MolDX for technology assessments of genomic-based tests and has adopted the Final LCD issued by MolDX. Noridian has issued its own LCD announcing coverage of the DMT. Even though the effective date of Noridian’s LCD is June 7, 2020, Noridian began reimbursing us for the DMT as of February 10, 2020. 
Of the approximate 4 million surgical biopsies performed each year on pigmented skin lesions, over 90% are negative for melanoma and represent avoidable surgical procedures. The DMT (without TERT assay) improves the assessment of pigmented lesions by reducing the probability of missing melanoma to less than 1.0% (versus approximately 11-17% with surgical biopsies, the existing standard of care) and by reducing the number of surgical biopsies required to diagnose melanoma by five to tenfold (from about 25:1 to about 2.5-5.0:1). In addition, the DMT (without TERT assay) improves the positive predictive value (“PPV”) approximately five-fold (from 3-4% with the current surgical techniques to 18.7% with DMT without TERT assay) (Gerami et al. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2017; Skelsey et al. SKIN. 2021; Brouha et al SKIN. 2021).
The performance of the DMT is supported by numerous investigational studies, which enrolled an aggregate of over 9,000 patients and yielded more than 20 peer-reviewed publications in top-rated medical dermatology journals, including two publications covering the TERT add-on assay. A study published in JAMA Dermatology directed to the DMT (without TERT assay) demonstrated that incorporation of the test in practice could significantly lower the cost to diagnose melanoma while providing a more accurate assessment and less invasive alternative to current methods. The current AAD melanoma guidelines indicate that non-invasive gene expression testing can be used as a part of the initial clinical assessment for pigmented lesions. In January 2021, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (“NCCN”) updated their NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (“NCCN Guidelines®”) for cutaneous melanoma under "Common Follow-up Recommendations for All Patients" as Category 2A, which states the use of pre-diagnostic noninvasive genomic patch testing may be helpful to guide biopsy decisions for cutaneous melanoma. The NCCN reaffirmed their recommendation in December 2022 (version 1.2023) that "for melanocytic neoplasms that are clinically/dermoscopically suspicious for melanoma, pre-diagnostic noninvasive patch testing may be helpful to guide biopsy decisions" for cutaneous melanoma. The NCCN’s recommendation indicated that there is uniform consensus that the intervention is appropriate. Also, recommendations and/or commentary regarding the DMT (without TERT assay) have been published by the National Society for Cutaneous Medicine ("NSCM"), the Melanoma Research Alliance ("MRA"), and UpToDate. Additionally, an independent panel of melanoma experts has produced consensus recommendations for use of the DMT (without TERT assay). We believe the DMT can be used as an alternative for the majority of these surgical biopsy procedures. In 2019, our platform became available for use in Canada based on Health Canada compliance and we have established a non-exclusive partnership with DermTech Canada. We are working with two Canadian provinces, British Columbia, and Ontario, which are evaluating our technology for coverage and reimbursement.

We market our DMT directly to dermatologists in the United States with a team of approximately 70 sales representatives. With Medicare and TRICARE coverage (for DMT without TERT assay), Veteran Affairs coverage (for DMT), contracts covering the DMT (without TERT assay) with 6 out of 10 insurers associated with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (“Blues plans”), plus a favorable policy of the DMT (without TERT assay) with the second largest lab benefit manager in the United States, and increased test volume, we believe the DMT (without TERT assay) is being reviewed for coverage by additional large commercial payors. We believe we will achieve successful coverage outcomes from these efforts over the next 12 to 24 months, although no assurances can be given that any reimbursement coverage approvals will be obtained.
We believe the total annual United States market opportunity for the DMT may exceed $2.5 billion, and that the select annual worldwide market consisting of Australia, Europe, and Canada exceeds $750 million. We currently offer the DMT primarily in the United States. 
We are currently developing other skin cancer tests, including for non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell cancers). In the United States, approximately 12 million surgical biopsies are performed each year to diagnose approximately 5.4 million non-melanoma skin cancers. Many of the initial surgical procedures for these skin cancers are performed on cosmetically sensitive areas of the body, such as the face, neck and chest, creating significant demand for a non-invasive alternative. We believe the total market opportunity for our non-melanoma skin cancer products may exceed $3 billion in the United States and $1 billion in select world-wide markets.
We are also developing tests to facilitate the assessment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, which will aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in the United States is reported to be approximately 12% in children and 7.0% in adults with approximately 6.6 million patients having moderate-to-severe disease. The prevalence of psoriasis in the United States is approximately 2.2% with approximately 1.3 million patients having moderate to severe disease.
We also provide contract research services using our non-invasive molecular skin analysis platform available to pharmaceutical companies to facilitate the development of new therapies (including biologics) in dermatology and cancer. These companies may use our platform and services using genomic and other biomarkers to assess treatment response, monitor side effects, identify potential drug targets, and identify likely responders to the therapy under development. We have completed and have ongoing contract research services with large pharmaceutical companies. We have supported programs across the spectrum of pharmaceutical development stages from Phase 1 through Phase 3. We believe that some of these collaborations may lead to a complementary or companion diagnostic product for the pharmaceutical partner’s therapeutic candidate, if it reaches the commercial market. We have booked over $0.9 million of orders pursuant to research contracts in 2022, and many of these contracts are multi-year in length.
We offer our laboratory services through our CLIA certified and CAP accredited commercial laboratory located in La Jolla, California, which is licensed by the State of California and all states requiring out-of-state licensure, including New York, which is generally considered to have a rigorous licensing process for clinical diagnostic laboratories. We can scale our current laboratory facility to handle approximately 150,000 DMT tests per year. We are currently qualifying our new laboratory facility in San Diego, California. Once operationalized and optimized in laboratory processes, we believe the new laboratory should be able to scale to over 1,000,000 tests per year. We expect to transition commercial laboratory operations to the new facility in the first half of 2023.
Our sample collection technology maximizes collection of relevant tissue with minimal patient discomfort using adhesive patches. We have developed significant intellectual property and know-how around the use of adhesives for non-invasive testing handling of this type of sample (e.g., storage/transportation). We have developed a proprietary process that allows us to extract genomic material from the patches with sufficient quality and quantity to perform downstream analyses, including gene expression, DNA mutation and transcriptomic analyses. We believe our technology may be used to assess the microbiome of the skin with potentially improved performance to existing methods. The development efforts may permit the introduction of our sample collection technology to facilitate evaluation of various dermatologic conditions and other conditions where the skin serves as a surrogate target organ.
Our Competitive Advantages
The DermTech Melanoma Test enhances early melanoma detection by differentiating high risk moles that should undergo biopsy from those that can be monitored over time. The DMT is used to assess pigmented lesions by detecting melanoma-associated genomic markers to identify melanomas and higher-risk lesions at their earliest stages (melanoma in situ or stage 1a). In our clinical studies, the DMT has an observed sensitivity of 91-97% and a specificity of 69-91% in differentiating these early-stage melanomas from non-melanomas using expert consensus histopathologic diagnosis as the reference standard. This results in a NPV of greater than 99%, which is the probability the DMT ruled out melanoma. We completed a long-term follow-up study directed to the DMT (without TERT assay) that also confirmed the

99% NPV by reevaluating and retesting lesions that tested negative 12 to 24 months prior to each subject’s enrollment in the study. We also completed another study, ("TRUST Study"), that demonstrated that the DMT (without TERT assay) increases the PPV for melanoma diagnosis by approximately fivefold, from 3-4% for the current pathway to 18.7% for the DMT (without TERT assay) (Skelsey et al. SKIN. 2021). We have initiated our “TRUST 2 Study” in 2022 as a long-term follow-up investigation to further validate the clinical utility of our test. This study enrolled over 3,000 people, which is twice the size of our first TRUST study, and was designed to be a prospective evaluation for this patient population. In addition, DMT (without TERT assay) has demonstrated an approximate tenfold reduction in unnecessary surgical procedures, relative to the current visual assessment and histopathology standard of care. Such a reduction can result in significant cost savings for the health care system and reduces patient morbidity as compared to other diagnostic approaches. Table 1 below compares the DMT (without TERT assay, except for sensitivity) with other techniques and the existing standard of care for assessing early-stage melanoma in pigmented skin lesions (Gerami et al. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2017; Jackson et al. SKIN. 2021).

Our technology platform has the potential to transform dermatologic practice. We are the first and only company to offer non-invasive genomic testing to clinicians that practice dermatology. Current dermatologic practice is based on subjective visual assessments of cellular change that are prone to inaccuracy and lead to invasive surgical procedures that drive unnecessary costs. Our technology platform seeks to transform this paradigm by enhancing early detection at the genome level where cancer begins. Our product provides non-invasive, objective, and more accurate information, thereby broadening the base of clinicians that can practice dermatology while also improving the performance of specialists. 
Ease of use. Our non-invasive Smart Sticker sample collection procedure can be performed in less than five minutes. All the necessary items, including Smart Stickers, instructions, a marking pen for outlining, and a preaddressed and prepaid return shipping label, are contained in our kit. With a clinician's order of the test, the collection procedure can also be performed at the patient’s home with clinician guidance, and where clinically appropriate. 
Simple integration into clinical practice. Our Smart Sticker may replace the scalpel traditionally used in the initial clinical assessment of melanoma. Unlike other technologies, our platform does not require the installation and maintenance of capital equipment. Nursing support, documentation, specimen processing, and requisition are substantially similar to current practice. These advantages are critical in a busy clinical practice where clinicians see patients every five to seven minutes. 
Strong intellectual property protection. We have 12 issued or allowed United States patents, one of which is broadly directed to the use of an adhesive tape to collect skin samples for analysis of nucleic acids. In addition, we have been awarded patents on unique gene expression profiles and linked to melanoma, two of which will not expire until 2029, and a third will not expire until 2030. Additional efforts to further expand our patent portfolio are ongoing and a number of provisional and non-provisional patent applications have been filed. We have also developed unique know-how and proprietary processes that allow us to extract sufficient quantities of low-quality genomic material from adhesive patch samples suitable for analysis. 
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to become the global leader in non-invasive genomics testing for dermatologic conditions. We believe our robust intellectual property portfolio, platform technology, first-to-market advantage, and groundbreaking research will facilitate the achievement of this goal. Specifically, we will focus on the following objectives: 
Build a specialized sales force to introduce our products to dermatologists. We have established a direct specialty sales force. We will continue to recruit experienced sales representatives as needed, primarily those from the dermatology sector who have existing physician relationships. We believe we could also leverage this sales force by establishing additional distribution relationships with laboratory companies that do business with clinical dermatologists or sell molecular tests. We recently announced an agreement with Sonora Quest Laboratories ("Sonora Quest") that allows them to be the exclusive laboratory in Arizona to offer the DMT to its vast network of healthcare providers. 
Secure broad reimbursement coverage for our assays. We have targeted regional and national commercial payors, as well as national government payors, to secure favorable reimbursement coverage for our test. The DMT has completed the necessary analytical validity, clinical validity, clinical utility and health economic studies that payors require of molecular tests. The cost to fully adjudicate a pigmented lesion suspicious for melanoma ranges from $1,196 to $1,396 in the United States. We believe the DMT could lead to cost savings of greater than $650 million per year in aggregate savings, based on approximately 4 million surgical biopsies performed per year to rule out melanoma if the DMT became the standard of care in the United States.
In addition to our demonstrated clinical validity, clinical utility is the most important attribute of a test for establishing coverage policies with payors because it demonstrates how frequently physicians adhere to the recommendation of the test and the resulting improvement in clinical outcomes. In 2020, we completed and published our largest clinical utility study of the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) based on real-world commercial usage. This study involved 3,418 cases and corroborates earlier utility studies and demonstrates that clinicians adhere to the recommendation of the DMT more than 98% of the time. The DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) significantly reduces surgical procedures and improves the diagnostic pathway for pigmented lesion assessment. Lesions clinically suspicious for melanoma have negative test results in over 90% of cases, leading to an approximately 90% reduction in surgical biopsies in our 2020 study (Brouha et al. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020). In January of 2021, we published additional registry study data highlighting that use of the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) enriches biopsied samples for melanoma almost 5-fold (Brouha et al. SKIN. 2021). We believe our body of clinical evidence and utility will lead to securing coverage policies from the major commercial payors over the next 12 to 24 months, although no assurances can be given that any reimbursement coverage approvals will be obtained.
Table of Contents

We have secured several contracts with major preferred provider networks and national governmental payers. We also received a favorable policy from the second largest lab benefit manager in the United States. We have submitted clinical and technology assessment packages to several lab benefit managers and third-party review organizations that provides consultative services for payors. We are engaged with several national commercial payors which have the DMT currently under review. 
Integrate our products into the standard of care. We conduct rigorous clinical research and publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. Overall, our research has yielded over 20 publications. The DMT’s (referred to as the PLA in these studies) performance is supported by over ten investigational studies, which enrolled an aggregate of over 9,000 patients. Our research is frequently highlighted at clinical meetings and has several times been accepted for peer-reviewed late-breaking presentations at major medical society meetings.
The AAD melanoma guidelines have indicated that non-invasive gene expression testing can be used as a part of the initial clinical assessment for pigmented lesions. In January 2021, NCCN recommended under "Common Follow-up Recommendations for All Patients" the use of pre-diagnostic noninvasive genomic patch testing may be helpful to guide biopsy decisions for cutaneous melanoma. In December 2022 (version 1.2023), NCCN reaffirmed its recommendation that "for melanocytic neoplasms that are clinically/dermoscopically suspicious for melanoma, pre-diagnostic noninvasive patch testing may be helpful to guide biopsy decisions" for cutaneous melanoma. In addition, an independent panel of melanoma experts produced consensus recommendations for use of the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT), which were published in 2019.
We have established an extensive group of advisors of Key Opinion Leaders (“KOLs”) in dermatology, including multiple former presidents of the AAD. These KOLs speak extensively about our technology platform and the DMT at various clinical and research meetings. In addition, these KOLs participate in our clinical studies and publish findings in peer-reviewed journals. 
Establish alternate care delivery channels. We continue to expand our efforts in alternate care delivery channels including telemedicine, integrated primary care networks, and reference labs and community primary care clinics. During 2021, we launched our new telemedicine mobile application, DermTech Connect, where permitted by law and applicable standards of care and practice guidelines. Using DermTech Connect, a patient can submit photos of suspicious lesions to an independent clinician on the DermTech Connect platform. The clinician can determine, if they deem it medically necessary to order the DMT, in which case a Smart Sticker Collection Kit is mailed to the patient, followed by at home self-collection with remote virtual supervision by a DermTech patient liaison. 
These channels can help to democratize access to high quality dermatologic care, alleviate certain dermatologist capacity limitations and the related long lead times for dermatology specialist appointment availability. These channels can also improve the delivery of care to patients with ease of use, improved commute and wait times, and reduced patient fear that can accompany referrals to dermatology specialists. 
Establish distribution partnerships for primary care. A substantial portion of dermatology is practiced in primary care. Based on the adoption progress we make within dermatology and integrated primary care networks, we plan to eventually access the primary care market more broadly by potentially establishing distribution relationships with companies that focus on these physicians. An ideal partner would have several hundred total sales professionals who access the primary care market with experience selling genomic diagnostic products. Alternatively, we may hire sales representatives to make direct calls to primary care offices. We recently announced an agreement with Sonora Quest that allows them to be the exclusive laboratory in Arizona to offer the DMT to its vast network of healthcare providers. 
Expand our product offerings. We have developed a platform that provides genomic analysis of the skin using our noninvasive Smart Sticker platform as the sample collection method. This platform can be used to develop multiple products based on the same sample collection method, as it only requires different genomic markers to be assayed in our CLIA-certified laboratory. We are currently developing additional products, which includes an assessment of non-pigmented lesions for basal cell and squamous cell cancers and products that assess precancerous genomic changes associated with UV sun exposure. In addition, we are working to develop tests for inflammatory diseases of the skin. 
Expand our marketing of research services to pharmaceutical companies. Our platform is used by several pharmaceutical companies to facilitate development of new targeted therapeutics in dermatology. Our Smart Sticker helps identify biomarkers, the assessment of which may inform treatment responses, track side effects, and identify patients that respond to therapy. We have branded our research service offering as DermTech Stratum and are offering additional services and capabilities. Our collaborations with pharmaceutical partners may result in the introduction of complementary or companion diagnostic products for the partners’ therapeutic candidates that reach the commercial market.

Market Opportunity – Skin Cancer 
Melanoma is one of the fastest growing cancers and the subject of significant attention in the medical community. The incidence of melanoma has doubled from 1982 to 2011. While there has been a 32% decline in cancer deaths overall since 1991, melanoma is one of three cancers facing increasing death rates. According to a study from the Mayo Clinic, the incidence of melanoma increased eightfold among women under 40 and fourfold among men under 40 from 1970 to 2009. 
Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer. On average, melanoma causes more than one death every hour of every day of the year in the United States. The American Cancer Society projects that approximately 7,990 people will die from melanoma in 2023. If diagnosed and removed early, when confined to the outermost skin layer and deemed to be “in situ” (Stage 0), patients are expected to have a survival rate of almost 100%. Invasive melanomas that are thin and extend into the uppermost regions of the second skin layer (Stage 1) have cure rates greater than 90%. However, once the cancer advances into the deeper layers of skin, the risk of it spreading to other parts of the body, or metastasis, and death increases. The table below depicts the survival rate of melanoma based on the stage of the cancer at initial diagnosis. 
From Balch CM, Buzaid AC, Soong S-j et al: Final Version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System for Cutaneous Melanoma. Journal of Clinical Oncology, August 2001.
Per the Skin Cancer Foundation, an estimated 186,680 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2023. Of those, it is estimated that approximately half will be in situ (noninvasive), or confined to the epidermis (the top layer of skin), and the other half will be invasive, penetrating the epidermis into the skin’s second layer (the dermis). On average, 25 surgical biopsies are performed per early-stage melanoma diagnosed, creating a total market opportunity of approximately 4.0 million surgical procedures per year. Outside the United States, the incidence of melanoma is highest in Western Europe, Australia, and Canada. We estimate that these select worldwide markets perform over 1.5 million surgical biopsies annually to diagnose approximately 75,000 melanomas, creating additional market opportunity that we believe exceeds $750 million annually.
Over 5.4 million non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) are diagnosed in the United States annually. The number of surgical biopsies needed to diagnose one non-melanoma skin cancer is approximately 2.5-3.0 among dermatologists and can be considerably higher when diagnosed by other clinicians such as nurse practitioners and primary care physicians. While these cancers are not as deadly as melanoma, they commonly occur on the face, head, neck, and other cosmetically sensitive areas, creating an important unmet medical need for a non-invasive alternative, and a potential market opportunity for non-melanoma sink cancer is approximately $3.0 billion annually in the United States based on the approximately 10-12 million surgical biopsies performed to diagnose basal and squamous cell skin cancers. 
Limitations of Current Melanoma Diagnostic Pathway 
The estimated prevalence of pigmented lesions (moles) ranges from 2% to 8% in fair-skinned persons.
Table of Contents

Pigmented lesions may be classified as clinically atypical by meeting one or more of the American Cancer Society’s ABCDE criteria, which includes Asymmetric, irregular Border, variegated or dark Color, Diameter greater than 6 mm, or Evolving mole. Atypical pigmented lesions are at risk for harboring melanoma. A meta-analysis of case-control studies found that the relative risk of melanoma is 1.45 in patients with one atypical mole vs. those with none, and this risk increases to 6.36 in those patients with five atypical moles. Management of atypical pigmented lesions involves ruling out melanoma via a visual assessment followed by surgical biopsy and histopathology. Ideally, when melanomas are identified, they are found at the earliest stages (melanoma in situ or stage 1a) when a high cure rate is possible by wide excision. Since a biopsy only partially removes a lesion for histopathologic analysis, early-stage melanomas diagnosed histopathologically from biopsy material are treated with follow-up wide excision procedures (generally with 0.5-1.0 cm margins). 
While the purpose of the visual assessment or surgical biopsy is to rule out melanoma, the subpar results of this diagnostic pathway leads to a low NPV for early-stage disease (Table 2 below). This is related to the low specificity of the visual assessment (3-10%), which results in a high number of biopsies on benign atypical nevi. During histopathologic assessment, a small number of melanomas must be identified from this large pool of biopsied atypical nevi. However, there is significant overlap in the histopathologic diagnostic criteria between atypical nevi and early-stage melanoma, invariably leading to false negative diagnoses and a relatively low sensitivity (65-84%). Elmore et al. BMJ (2017) 357:j2183, concluded that the diagnosis of early stage melanoma was not accurate after finding that 35% of slide interpretations for melanoma in situ or stage 1a melanomas by 187 pathologists received a false negative diagnosis as benign. With the prevalence of early-stage melanoma in biopsied lesions at approximately 5%, the negative predictive value ranges from 75-89%. 
Welch and colleagues’ most recent N Engl J Med article (2021, 384:72-79) points out that melanoma diagnoses have increased more than 6-fold over the last 40 years. The authors attribute this increase to more frequent enhanced screening, lower pathological thresholds to label the morphologic changes as cancer, and heightened clinical awareness to biopsy pigmented lesions. However, the article fails to address the limitations of the current care standard for evaluating pigmented lesions, which relies primarily on visual atypia to guide biopsy decisions. About 4 million pigmented lesions are biopsied each year in the US alone to diagnose fewer than 200,000 cutaneous melanomas (about 25 biopsies to detect 1 melanoma based on Anderson et al. JAMA Dermatol. (2018) 154(5):569-573). Using non-invasive assessment of genomic atypia offered by the DMT rather than visual atypia alone to guide pigmented lesion biopsy decisions reduces avoidable biopsies while missing fewer melanomas. Precision genomics is currently used in other areas of oncology and has changed the paradigm of treatment. Integrating use of the DMT and precision genomics to enhance early detection non-invasively into standard practice rather than performing fewer skin examinations appears to be a superior solution to the conundrum highlighted by Welch and colleagues.
According to several published papers, the real NPV of the visual assessment or surgical biopsy pathway is likely 80% to 85%. In a study by Malvehy et al., BJD (2014) 171:1099, 206 in situ and stage 1a (thickness less than 0.75 mm) melanomas were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 10%. The prevalence of early melanoma in the study was about 10%, yielding an NPV of 83%. In addition, the current pathway using visual atypia to guide biopsy decisions suffers from a low PPV of approximately 4% for melanoma diagnosis. The addition of the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) to the visual assessment by clinicians increased the PPV for a melanoma diagnosis by approximately five-fold to 18.7%.

 | Current Pathway | DMT 
Type | Surgical biopsy/ histopathology | Non-invasive gene expression
NPV | 83% | 99% 
Probability of Missed Mel | 17% | 1% 
Probability of Mel Diagnosis | 4% | 18.7% 
Number Needed to Biopsy | 25 | 2.7 
Number Needed to Excise | 5.2 | 1.6 
Cost per Lesion Tested | $1,196 - $1,396 | $760 

Table 2. Data summarized above compares the key performance metrics of the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) versus the current pathway (visual assessment and surgical biopsy/histopathology) for managing pigmented skin lesions.

This low NPV for the current pathway is accompanied by a high number of unnecessary surgical procedures, again driven by the poor specificity of the visual assessment. The number of surgical biopsies needed to identify one melanoma averages 25 and ranges from eight to greater than 30 depending on the clinical setting. Further, the histopathologic review of biopsied lesions is extremely limited with 2% or less of the lesion sectioned and evaluated, leaving doubt as to what may be occurring in the rest of the lesion. Consequently, lesions that have cellular atypia and positive margins are often clinically managed conservatively and subjected to full excisions with margins. However, only 0.2% to less than 1.0% of lesions with atypia and positive margins that undergo excision are diagnostically upgraded, most commonly to a higher level of atypia and rarely to melanoma in situ, and such excisions can be considered unnecessary. Approximately 5.2 excisions with margins are performed per melanoma identified, emphasizing how the current pathway of surgical biopsy and limited histopathology assessment leads to more complex and invasive excisions. 
Our Products 
DermTech Melanoma Test (formerly the PLA and/or PLAplus)
The DMT enhances early melanoma detection by non-invasively detecting genomic markers associated with melanoma to identify higher risk lesions at their earliest stages to rule out melanoma. The performance of the DMT is supported by over ten investigational studies, which enrolled over 9,000 patients and yielded over 20 peer-reviewed publications in top rated medical dermatology journals, including two publications that cover the TERT add-on-assay. Key studies and manuscripts are summarized in Table 3 below. The DMT is based on a platform technology for non-invasive genomic testing of the skin, which allows the molecular analysis of samples collected from adhesive patches. In contrast to the current visual assessment pathway, the DMT has a very high NPV (greater than 99%) and high sensitivity (91-97%), ensuring a very low probability of missing melanoma (Jackson et al. SKIN. 2020). 
The NPV of the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) is supported by a 12-month follow-up study of 734 patients, which demonstrated that no melanomas were missed in the 12-month period following initial testing. In the third quarter of 2019 we initiated the TRUST study, which further examined long-term follow up of lesions previously tested negative by the DMT, and incorporated repeat testing of the previously tested lesion. This study more definitively confirmed the high NPV of the DMT in a real-world setting, and we announced those topline results in December 2020. Of the lesions evaluated by means of repeat testing with the DMT (n=302), none were found to have clinically obvious melanoma upon the subject’s return to the clinic, confirming the results of the initial chart review. Eighty-nine percent of these lesions were negative on repeat testing with the DMT and 11.2% were positive. Positive lesions were biopsied and subjected to a single read histopathologic review. One percent of lesions (n=3) that tested positive on repeat testing were diagnosed as Stage 0, in situ. Photographic review of the three Stage 0 cases identified changes in clinical appearance since the initial test. The pathology reports from the remaining biopsied lesions indicated a variety of non-melanoma diagnoses, including compound nevi with mild to moderate atypia. Given the early stage (in situ) of the melanomas detected on repeat testing, and length of time from the initial test (an average of 15 months), it is difficult to determine whether these melanomas evolved after the initial test or were present at the time of the initial test. In any case, the finding of three melanomas in a cohort of 302 lesions subjected to repeat testing further confirms an NPV of the DMT of at least 99.0% and is consistent with the results from the full long-term follow‑up cohort. These results exemplify how the DMT repeat testing of lesions that may have evolved over time after the initial negative DMT test have potential to identify early-stage melanoma and benefit patients. TRUST study findings corroborating the DMT’s high NPV were complemented by most recent registry data on the DMT’s high PPV (Brouha et al., SKIN, January 2021, 5(1):13-18). This data show that 316 lesions clinically suspicious for melanoma that were biopsied based on guidance offered by genomic atypia (positive DMT results rather than visual atypia alone) were enriched approximately five-fold for histopathologic features of melanoma. 
During the second quarter of 2021, we announced the launch of the optional add-on test for TERT (then known as PLAplus) available to those ordering the DMT, which delivers objective and actionable information to guide clinical management decisions for skin lesions suspicious of melanoma. This add-on test combines TERT promoter DNA driver mutation analyses as a reflex test to the DMT’s standard RNA gene expression test. TERT is individually associated with histopathologic features of aggressiveness and poor survival in melanoma. The combined tests elevate the sensitivity from 91% to 97% and maintain a negative predictive value of >99%, resulting in a less than 1% probability of missing melanoma (Jackson et al. SKIN. 2020). By combining RNA gene expression and DNA mutation analyses, the DMT provides a highly accurate non-invasive genomic test for enhanced early melanoma detection.

Smart Sticker 
We are the inventor and owner of the intellectual property for the Smart Sticker collection kit (pictured below). We have contracted with a Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) registered supplier to produce our kit under applicable quality systems requirements, and we control the exclusive distribution rights for the kit. Our Smart Sticker allows for the collection of skin samples with minimal patient discomfort. A single kit contains all of the necessary components to complete the sample collection for our analysis, including the Smart Stickers, instructions for use, a marking pen for lesion outlining, and a pre-addressed and prepaid return shipping pack. The unique properties of the Smart Sticker maximize the collection of informative cellular material for the DMT. The sample collection in the clinician’s office usually takes less than five minutes. 
Telemedicine Option for the DermTech Melanoma Test
Telemedicine is typically considered to be the provision of health-related services via electronic information and telecommunication technologies. Telemedicine is sometimes used interchangeably with telehealth, but some organizations define telemedicine in a more limited sense to describe remote clinical services, such as diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Telemedicine enables patient and clinician interaction when rural settings, lack of transport, lack of mobility, decreased funding, lack of staff or other limitations hinders or restricts in-office care. 
For patients who cannot easily attend an in-office visit, we offer two telemedicine solutions that enable dermatologists to conduct a virtual office visit with a patient to collect a skin sample, remote telemedicine collection and DermTech Connect. 
Using the remote telemedicine collection option, a clinician can choose to assess the patient’s skin and suspicious lesion(s) via a telemedicine appointment they arrange with their patient and, if indicated, submit a patient-specific order to DermTech for the DMT. In this case, a Smart Sticker Collection Kit is then mailed to the patient directly. During a follow-up telemedicine appointment, a clinician instructs and supervises the patient to collect their sample with the easy-to-use DermTech Smart Sticker. The patient then returns the collected sample(s) back to DermTech via a pre-labeled shipping envelope for analysis. Test results are made available to the ordering clinician within a few days.

Another telemedicine option is available to patients through the DermTech Connect mobile application, where permitted by law and consistent with applicable standards of care and practice guidelines. DermTech Connect enables a user to take a picture of a suspicious lesion with their phone and submit the picture to an independent clinician to assess the lesion. As of the date of this report, DermTech Connect is only available to patients of clinicians subscribed to DermTech Connect in 46 states and remains limited in operations. Subscribing clinicians utilizing DermTech Connect charge a pre-determined amount for the patient services and no claims are submitted for reimbursement of the clinical telemedicine services. These subscribing clinicians pay DermTech a fixed amount for use of the DermTech Connect platform. The clinician can also determine, if they deem it medically necessary, to order the DMT, in which case a Smart Sticker Collection Kit is mailed to the patient, followed by at-home self-collection with remote virtual supervision by a DermTech patient liaison. Many state laws and regulations impose various requirements on the practice of telemedicine, the regulatory landscape is evolving and DermTech Connect is not and may not become available in all states. The telemedicine market is relatively new and unproven, especially within dermatology, and it is uncertain whether the telemedicine options for the DMT will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, consumer acceptance and market adoption.
In May 2020, SKIN, the official journal of the National Society for Cutaneous Medicine, published proof-of-concept data demonstrating that patients are able to reliably perform remote self-sampling of concerning moles using the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) under clinical supervision via telemedicine, enabling actionable molecular testing for accurate melanoma detection. As part of the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approved pilot study, 258 eligible melanoma survivors were contacted, and of the 211 who expressed interest in the DMT, there were seven cases of self-identified concerning lesions, which were confirmed by a clinician to be suspicious of melanoma. These patients then conducted sample collections using DermTech’s Smart Sticker at home under the supervision of a clinician via telemedicine. Results from the study showed that skin samples collected by patients enabled successful DMT testing to objectively rule out melanoma in all of the cases evaluated. These findings are in line with sample collection results by licensed providers.
Clinical Research Products 
Research on the genomic basis of diseases has increased significantly over the last decade. Genomic analysis can facilitate drug development by identifying drug targets and stratifying patients into groups that will maximize drug response. Genomic analysis is part of the effort to personalize medical therapy to patients’ individual needs. Consequently, tools to facilitate this type of research are in high demand. 
We offer a suite of products to facilitate clinical research using our technology platform. We have developed a proprietary process that allows us to extract genomic and protein material from our Smart Sticker with sufficient quality and quantity to perform gene expression, DNA mutation analysis, DNA methylation, and transcriptomic analyses. In addition, our platform may be utilized to assess the microbiome of the skin with improved performance to some existing methods. We have developed gene expression assays for the Th1, Th2, IFN-gamma, and Th17 inflammatory pathways. We market these assays to pharmaceutical companies developing drug products in dermatology. In addition, we develop custom gene assays to support development for these pharmaceutical partners. We have completed and have ongoing research collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies to facilitate their development of new targeted therapeutics in dermatology. Our technology platform has been deployed in Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical programs. These efforts may also lead to the introduction of complementary and companion diagnostic products. 
Leveraging Our Platform for Other Indications 
We believe our Smart Sticker specimen collection platform is applicable to numerous other indications in dermatology. While we are focused initially on skin cancer products, we believe there are significant business development opportunities in other areas. We have undertaken several pilot development activities in inflammatory diseases, and skin aging. We also focus on potential licensing and partnering opportunities for the development of complementary and companion diagnostics for the pharmaceutical partners’ drug product candidates, should they reach the commercial market. In addition, because the processing of samples is the same regardless of the disease indication, our development activities will leverage our existing laboratory operations.

Skin Cancer DNA Risk Assessment Product (Luminate)
We are currently developing a direct to consumer ("DTC") skin cancer DNA risk assessment test to assess genomic changes that develop in UV damaged skin and are linked to a higher risk for developing certain carcinomas. More specifically, the product comprises of a laboratory developed test that is ordered with physician oversight via a telemedicine platform. The test is designed to detect DNA mutations in key genes associated with a risk for developing non-melanoma skin cancers and precancerous actinic keratosis. Consumers would learn of the DNA mutation detected and the overall relative risk for the conditions linked to those mutations, which allow them be better informed and educated about their skin health and various options to prevent further UV damage or reparative treatments in partnership with their healthcare provider. The skin samples are collected at-home by the consumer using a non-invasive adhesive patch collection kit..
According to Global Market Insights, the DTC genetic testing market in North American is valued at $591 million which includes DTC tests focusing on carrier, predictive, ancestry & relationship, nutrigenomics, skincare and others. While the skincare testing is a small portion of this DTC test segment today, several DNA and AI skin health tests have launched. As of 2021, 100,000,000 people worldwide have shared their DNA with a company that provides genomic testing in the foregoing focus areas.
Based on our market research, 83% of consumers are interested specifically in a DNA test for assessing risk of developing common non-melanoma skin cancers. Our research has indicated that post COVID, consumers have become very accustomed to taking health and wellness tests at home and are comfortable receiving results through electronic means that can later be discussed with their healthcare provider if needed. The younger generations spend time worrying about their past and present sun exposure, but do not take the action of seeing a physician for a skin check until something suspicious appears. The Luminate test will allow consumers to be better informed and thus take action before something becomes visible, so they can make data driven, fact-based decisions about their skin health and in partnership with their healthcare provider.
Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Diagnostic Products
To complement the DMT, we are also using our platform technology to develop products to rule out non-melanoma skin cancer including squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma. We have identified differentially expressed genes that allow the identification of basal cell carcinoma, are identifying differentially expressed genes to identify squamous cell carcinoma, and are currently conducting analytical and clinical validation studies. Nearly 5.4 million basal and squamous cell carcinoma skin cancers are diagnosed each year making skin cancer the most common of all types of cancer. The majority of these cancers occur in cosmetically sensitive areas such as the head, neck and face. The number of skin cancer cases is increasing due to better skin cancer detection, people living longer, and increased sun exposure. 
More than 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas. These cancers usually develop in sun-exposed areas, especially the head and neck, and tend to grow slowly. It is very rare for a basal cell cancer to spread to other parts of the body. If left untreated, basal cell cancers can grow into nearby areas and invade other tissues beneath the skin. If not removed completely, basal cell carcinoma can recur in the same place on the skin. People who have had basal cell skin cancers are also more likely to develop basal cell skin cancers in other places.
About 10% of skin cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. These cancers also commonly appear on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, ears, neck, lips, and backs of the hands. These cancers can also develop in scars or chronic skin sores elsewhere. Squamous cell cancers are more likely to grow into deeper layers of skin and spread to other parts of the body than basal cell cancers, although this is uncommon.
Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma 
We are currently exploring the development of a Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) rule out test. CTCL is a rare type of skin cancer in which T-cells become immunologically active and attack the skin. CTCL results in rash-like skin redness, slightly raised or scaly round patches on the skin, and, sometimes, skin tumors. These features can resemble much more common inflammatory skin conditions. 
Several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma exist including mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. Mycosis fungoides is the most common form of CTCL while Sezary syndrome is less common but causes skin redness across larger areas of the body. The definitive diagnosis of CTCL is often challenging because of its nonspecific clinical and pathologic features, which requires integration of clinical, histopathologic, immunophenotyping, and molecular data by the treating physician.

Inflammatory Indications 
Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are chronic inflammatory skin diseases that affect millions of people and are characterized by both local and systemic inflammation. We have investigated gene expression profiles in the skin of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Responses to biologic therapy used in moderate to severe forms of these diseases can be variable and may wane over time. For example, only 30-40% of patients have a robust response to either anti-TNF alpha drugs used in psoriasis or the Th2 targeting (anti-IL-4R or anti-IL-13) drugs used in atopic dermatitis. The low response rate of these drugs creates an unmet need for drug companion and complementary diagnostic products that identify responders to a specific therapy and that monitor responses over time.
Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are largely characterized by significant epidermal inflammation that can be used to assess benefit of interventional therapies. Due to their existing aberrant and damaged skin barrier, patients are unlikely to consent to repeated surgical biopsy procedures for the purposes of assessing therapy response. Our non-invasive genomics platform is therefore ideal for these types of conditions because it specifically samples tissue from the epidermis. 
In our psoriasis research, for example, we have identified subsets of patients with different gene expression profiles. These different profiles may identify patients that respond more robustly to an expanding group of biologic therapies available for this condition. In addition, we have shown in a pilot clinical investigation that only subsets of patients with atopic dermatitis appear to have high gene expression levels of IL-13. The proportion of patients that are high expressers of IL-13 is approximately 40%, which is consistent with the response rate of approximately 30-40% to the anti-IL4Ralpha (additionally blocks IL-13 signaling) drug dupilumab and anti-IL-13 drug tralokinumab. 
Microbiome Indications 
The study of bacterial microbes that inhabit the skin and their relationship to health and disease has been the subject of intense investigation over the last several years. Numerous products are under development that seek to alter the composition and populations of these microbes for therapeutic purposes. We have demonstrated in studies that our platform can be used to assess the genomics of skin microbes and that the quantity of microbial genomic material and the measurements of microbial variability are superior to the swab-based methods currently in use. In addition, our platform (which simultaneously and non-invasively collects skin host and microbiome samples) has the potential to separate and assess microbial populations at different depth levels in the epidermis. Given the growing interest in this area, we may look to develop products for this market in the future. 
Sales and Marketing 
The vast majority of molecular diagnostic tests are used by pathology and oncology practitioners. These markets are quickly becoming saturated with products and services. We believe that we have a unique opportunity as the first company to market a novel non-invasive molecular diagnostic test to dermatologists and other clinical practitioners of dermatology. We believe there are fewer barriers to adoption in this customer base than in other medical markets because our product fits within the current diagnostic and reimbursement pathway for various skin conditions.
We have established a sales team with extensive backgrounds in selling dermatology products. Our Chief Commercial Officer spent 24 years at Allergan plc and led their dermatology and ophthalmology product sales for the entire United States. We expanded our specialty sales force in 2020 and 2021, and could continue to expand our specialty sales force in the future as we secure reimbursement coverage from additional commercial payors. 
There are approximately 13,000 healthcare professionals specializing in dermatology in the United States. We segment these practices into three categories: primarily cosmetic practices (10-15%), mixed medical and cosmetic practices (50-75%), and medical only practices (15-25%). We focus much of our effort on practices that deliver some medical dermatology services. We have initially focused our selling activity on these accounts, which typically have a shorter adoption cycle. 
Our sales and marketing expansion includes multi-site group practices and integrated dermatology networks. Multi-site group practices and large integrated dermatology networks make up approximately 25% and 15%, respectively, of the remaining dermatology market. We are actively working to integrate the DMT in large dermatology networks in order to penetrate this market opportunity. 
Dermatology is also practiced in primary care. We may target primary care market by establishing distribution relationships with companies that focus on these physicians. These potential partners should have 400-600 sales professionals in the aggregate who access the primary care market, and ideally have experience offering a diagnostic or genomics product. Alternatively, we may plan to hire sales representative to engage with primary care doctors. We recently announced an agreement with Sonora Quest that allows them to be the exclusive laboratory in Arizona to offer the DMT to its vast network of healthcare providers. 
Table of Contents

Our marketing is focused on a mix of professional targeted campaigns including in person physician education, dermatology symposia, publication distribution, peer to peer education, consumer engagement and education campaigns including a mix of digital platforms. We participate as an exhibitor and sponsor at key dermatology conferences and will expand this effort to primary care conferences. We often submit scientific abstracts for presentation at the conferences we attend. Our KOLs speak on our behalf at various medical conferences, present data from our clinical studies, and chair continuing medical education courses on genomics in dermatology, which include our products.
These efforts extend to supporting our policy coverage review process with payors. Our KOL group includes multiple former AAD presidents and numerous melanoma, skin cancer and inflammatory disease experts.
We continuously expand and improve on the validation of our tests by conducting additional clinical trials, and we publish the results of our scientific and clinical work in peer-reviewed medical journals. Through these efforts, we elevated our positioning in the AAD guidelines, obtained a recommendation from NCCN, and consensus group recommendations. We also advertise in medical journals and employ social media campaigns to drive patient advocacy. We believe direct-to-consumer advertising will engage the patient to request our skin cancer assessment tests.
In 2019, our technology platform became available for use in Canada based on Health Canada compliance and we have established a non-exclusive partnership with DermTech Canada. We are working to secure coverage and reimbursement from two Canadian provinces, British Columbia and Ontario. We plan to engage in the marketing of our product in other countries outside the United States only after we have established the United States and Canadian markets. We will focus our efforts in regions that have a high incidence of melanoma and skin cancers such as Australia and Western Europe. We will likely seek distribution partners in these select countries for the sales and marketing of our tests. While we have demonstrated that the stability of the skin samples collected with our Smart Sticker sampling device is suitable for shipping from countries outside the United States, we will likely establish clinical laboratories or laboratory partnerships in some of these countries. 
Reimbursement Strategy 
On January 1, 2020, the AMA released a Proprietary Laboratory Analysis code, (0089U), for the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT). This code uniquely identifies the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT) and enables us to bill commercial and government payors when our test is ordered by a clinician. 
On February 10, 2020, Medicare Administrative Contractor Palmetto GBA/MolDx issued an LCD for the Pigmented Lesion Assay (L38051), now referred to as the DMT (without the add-on test for TERT). On June 10, 2020, Noridian, which is our Medicare Administrative Contractor, harmonized its LCD with MolDx, in effect making our test nationally covered and available for all Medicare and Medicare Advantage enrollees. The published reimbursement for our PLA code, 0089U, is $760 and was included in the 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 CLFS.
We have developed internal reimbursement capabilities, including claims submittal, follow-up and appeals functions to bill and collect reimbursement for services provided. We are currently out of network with many commercial payors and our initial claims are commonly denied. In situations where payment is denied, we work through the claims appeals process to secure payment for services performed. The appeals process can require several cycles and can culminate in an independent committee review for blocks of claims. We are not routinely successful in winning appealed claims.
To improve our allowed claim rate and payment, we are seeking contractual relationships and reimbursement coverage policy decisions from commercial payors. Reimbursement coverage decisions for clinical tests are primarily supported by clinical utility studies, increases in the patient experience and inclusion in guidelines. 
We have secured several contracts with major preferred provider networks. We have submitted clinical and technology assessment packages to several lab benefit managers and third-party review organizations that provides consultative services to payors, and several national commercial payors that have the DermTech Melanoma Test currently under review.
Competition 
The molecular diagnostics market is highly competitive. We compete with a number of manufacturers and distributors of molecular diagnostic tests as well as new and traditional medical devices and other technologies that are used to assist physicians with the assessment of pigmented lesions and the diagnosis of skin cancer. We are currently the only company to offer a non-invasive genomics test to clinical dermatology professionals. However, LEO Pharma A/S, a large Danish pharmaceutical company, and Mindera Corporation, a small early-stage start-up, are also working on minimally invasive genomic tests for the assessment of skin diseases. Castle Biosciences, Inc. recently launched gene expression assays as CLIA laboratory tests for surgical biopsy tissue specimens. Castle Biosciences, Inc. also markets a product to determine metastatic potential in later stage melanoma by utilizing surgical tissue samples.

There are several companies that market or are developing medical devices and imaging tools to detect melanoma. In general, medical devices have capital equipment costs and maintenance requirements, do not integrate well into clinical practice, and do not have clear mechanisms to provide physician payment. Strata Sciences, Inc. owns the rights to Melafind, an FDA-approved device that utilizes varying wavelengths of light to capture lesion images at different depths and conducts an algorithmic image analysis to determine the degree of lesion disorganization and the need for biopsy. The clinical trials of this device demonstrated marginal improvement in the assessment of pigmented lesions, and the device has not been adopted in the United States largely due to its specificity of less than 10%. SciBase AB is marketing an epidermal electrical impedance spectrometer to assess pigmented lesions, which received FDA approval in 2018. Verisante Technology, Inc. has received regulatory approval in Europe and Australia to market a device that uses real-time Raman spectroscopy to assess changes in the chemical composition of skin tissue. Welch-Allen, Inc. and various others manufacture dermatoscopes, which provide magnified views of a pigmented lesion during diagnosis. Caliber I.D. and others offer confocal microscopy solutions for enhanced imaging of pigmented skin lesions. 
Research and Development 
We have expertise in the development of gene expression profiles and other genomic analyses for the evaluation of dermatologic disease. In addition, we have developed know-how related to the collection of skin samples using adhesive patches. We have also developed expertise in statistical programs and algorithms that are used to process genomic data. 
Our product development process involves several stages. The first stage involves a genome-wide screen for differential gene expression or screens for differences in mutations, methylation patterns, micro-RNAs and other factors. In case of gene expression, differentially expressed genes are then narrowed down to specific gene sets that categorize disease states. These genes sets are then validated by comparison to clinical reference standards to produce a clinical product. We have developed substantial expertise in designing and conducting clinical validation and utility studies.
We have identified additional gene targets that may further improve the performance of the DMT. The qPCR assays for these genes are under development and may be added to our platform in the future if their performance is validated in additional clinical studies. We plan to expand the use of our platform to include products to diagnose or support the diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancers as well as a variety of inflammatory skin conditions. We have identified gene expression profiles for other conditions, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and aging of the skin. Should we determine that there are viable market opportunities for products treating these conditions, we will evaluate developing genomic tests for these conditions. Alternatively, we may seek development partners or licensing opportunities for these potential products. 
Intellectual Property 
We have developed a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property, comprised of 12 issued or allowed U.S. utility patents, 18 pending U.S. utility patent applications, four pending U.S. provisional patent applications, four U.S. issued or allowed design patent applications, five pending U.S. design patent applications, five issued foreign patents, 34 pending foreign patent applications, and four Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications.
The portfolio includes patents or patent applications directed to aspects of our assays, a sample collection system using adhesive tapes, methods for automated scanning and cutting of cells from skin collection kits, telemedicine methods, methods of detecting nucleic acid expression, methods of quantifying a mutation burden, and methods of diagnosing or treating various skin conditions including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, UV damage and various autoimmune disorders or inflammatory skin conditions. 
In addition, our intellectual property portfolio includes trademarks, design patents, trade secrets and know-how. We believe our intellectual property adequately protects our products and technology, and may prevent others from commercializing products or laboratory methods substantially similar to ours.
Laboratory Operations 
Our CLIA laboratory located in La Jolla, California, occupies approximately 9,000 square feet and is divided into an accession area, pre-qPCR-laboratory and post-qPCR-laboratory area as per CLIA standards. Access to all areas is controlled and requires gowning. The laboratory employs commercial state-of-the-art equipment including high-throughput qPCR machines. We use a laboratory information system to track all of our samples. We employ clinical laboratory scientists holding appropriate state licenses to perform all testing.

The DermTech Melanoma Test is comprised of two assays (the PLA and the optional TERT add-on assay). The DMT utilizes qPCR techniques that requires the extraction and purification of genomic material from the skin adhered to our Smart Stickers. This extraction process is extremely challenging, and we have developed a proprietary method involving customized reagents and tools to provide suitable material yields reliably. In general the process involves three main steps: 
•RNA/DNA extraction using our proprietary process to maximize the yields and quantity of RNA from the cells on the Smart Sticker while also extracting DNA from the sample to be used for the TERT analysis;
The PLA process involves: 
•reverse transcription, which converts the RNA into complementary DNA; and 
•expression level quantification, using qPCR to determine the expression levels of the target genes in our expression profile. 
The TERT process involves:
•Detection of mutations utilizing Sanger Sequencing in the TERT promoter region of the gene.
After testing is complete, a laboratory report is prepared and reviewed by one of our California-licensed and American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics-certified Laboratory Directors. This report is made available to the ordering physician by fax, via an internet portal, or via an electronic medical record system while adhering to requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). The reports are generated in industry-standard PDF format that allows for high-definition figures to be reproduced clearly. 
We continuously work to automate various steps in our end-to-end test processes. Much of this automation will come from purchasing and qualifying off-the-shelf and customized laboratory equipment such as liquid handlers and pipetting robots. We have developed a laser-cutting robot to automate the cutting of the lesion area circumscribed on the Smart Sticker by the clinician. We expect these automation efforts to improve assay throughput by reducing processing time compared to manual processing, reducing the need for direct labor, and improving quality by reducing the potential for human error. 
Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers 
We are the owner of intellectual property for the Smart Sticker with our logo and have contracted with an FDA-registered supplier to produce our kits. We believe this kit is considered a Class I medical device and is exempt from FDA premarket notification requirements. This product is manufactured according to the FDA’s applicable quality system manufacturing requirements. Our FDA-registered supplier conducts the assembly and labeling of this kit. Most of our suppliers are high-quality medical component and finished-product suppliers accustomed to working on high volume disposable FDA-regulated products. Our product has a shelf life tested to three years that allows us to build inventory to mitigate against disruptions. 
We currently have a sole source provider for the adhesive used in our Smart Sticker. We are actively working to identify second source suppliers for this component. We currently have sufficient adhesive supplies and inventory to meet our plans and objectives. 
Governmental Regulation 
The services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government health care programs. 
We believe our Smart Sticker, as a specimen collection device, is a Class I medical device that is exempt from obtaining premarket approval or clearance from the FDA. The FDA could declare our Smart Sticker a Class II or III device or as non-exempt. This would require us to submit an application for premarket clearance or approval, which may require us to develop additional clinical data to support premarket clearance or approval of the specimen collection product that could come at substantial expense and could disrupt our current business or affect our results of operations.
Table of Contents

Our qPCR gene expression assay is a laboratory developed test (“LDT”) that is currently regulated under CLIA. Although the FDA has asserted that it has authority to regulate LDTs, it has generally exercised enforcement discretion and is not otherwise regulating most tests developed and performed within a single, high-complexity, CLIA-certified laboratory. We have commercialized our test as an LDT and will process all tests in our single CLIA-certified central laboratory. We may at some time in the future seek FDA clearance or approval for our qPCR gene expression assay. We believe the data we have collected in the development of our LDT will support any FDA medical device clearance or approval process, but cannot guarantee that the FDA will find these data sufficient to support clearance or approval as a medical device under the applicable FDA regulations. This may require us to collect additional clinical data, which could come at substantial expense and could affect our results of operations. 
CLIA and State Regulation of Laboratories 
Clinical laboratories must hold certain federal, state, and local licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct business. Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to CLIA. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality, and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services.
Standards for testing under CLIA vary based on the test and level of test complexity. Laboratories performing high complexity testing must comply with more stringent requirements than laboratories performing waived or moderate complexity testing. In addition, CLIA requires each certified laboratory to enroll in an approved proficiency-testing program if it performs testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required. Such laboratories must periodically test specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then must submit the results back to that organization for evaluation. A laboratory that fails to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test may lose its right to perform testing in the category at issue. Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency- testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of the referring laboratory’s CLIA certification.
As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional unannounced inspections. Because we have obtained CAP accreditation, which is a CMS-approved accreditation organization, our biennial survey is conducted by CAP.
Our laboratory must comply with all CLIA requirements as well as with any additional requirements imposed by CAP. We also hold a laboratory permit from the State of California, as well as certain states that require an out-of-sate laboratory doing business in its state to be licensed. One such state is New York, which has state licensure standards that are more stringent than CLIA and its implementing regulations.
Our laboratory is licensed by the appropriate state agencies in the states in which we do business, if such licensure is required. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable licensing laws and regulations.
We may become aware from time to time of other states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure to accept specimens from patients within the state, and other states may impose such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements, or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow all instructions from the state regulators regarding compliance with such requirements. 
The FDA 
Although the FDA has asserted that it has the authority to regulate LDTs that are validated by the developing laboratory and performed only by that laboratory, it has generally exercised enforcement discretion by not otherwise regulating most tests developed and performed within a single high complexity CLIA-certified laboratory. Nevertheless, the FDA has, for the past decade, introduced various proposals to end enforcement discretion and to bring LDTs clearly under existing FDA regulatory frameworks. 
For several years, legislators have been working with stakeholders on a possible bill to regulate in vitro clinical tests including LDTs. Most recently, legislation called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID Act), has been garnering bipartisan and bicameral support. The VALID Act would codify into law the term “in vitro clinical test” (“IVCT”), to create new medical product category separate from medical devices that includes products currently 
Table of Contents

regulated as IVDs as well as LDTs. The VALID Act would also create a new system for labs and hospitals to use to submit their tests electronically to the FDA for approval, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time it takes for the agency to approve such tests, and establish a new program to expedite the development of diagnostic tests that can be used to address a current unmet need for patients. 
It is unclear whether the VALID Act would be passed by Congress in its current form or signed into law by the President. Until the FDA finalizes its regulatory position regarding LDTs through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, or the VALID Act or other legislation is passed reforming the federal government’s regulation of LDTs, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate our tests or what testing and data may be required to support any required clearance or approval. 
If the FDA decides to regulate LDTs, such as the DMT, as medical devices through notice-and-comment rulemaking or the VALID Act or other new federal legislation is passed reforming the government’s regulation of LDTs, or alternatively, if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT, we will be subject to increased regulatory burdens such as registration and listing, medical device reporting and quality control requirements. Any legislation or formal FDA regulatory framework affecting LDTs is also likely to have premarket submission requirements prohibiting commercialization without FDA authorization, controls regarding modification to the tests that may require further FDA submissions, as well as other increased regulatory burdens that will likely our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. The process would likely be costly and time-consuming. In addition, if premarket review is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to the FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make. We cannot assure that the DMT, or any new tests that we may develop or new uses for our products that we develop will be cleared or approved by the FDA in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. Even if such tests are cleared or approved, the products may not be cleared or approved for all of our proposed or desired indications. Any of these events could significantly limit the market for that product and may adversely affect our results of operations.
We believe that the Smart Sticker we provide for collection and transport of skin samples from a healthcare provider (or in our recently launched telemedicine option, from a patient at home with supervised collection) to our clinical laboratory is a Class I medical device subject to FDA regulations, although currently exempt from premarket review by the FDA. It is manufactured by a third party on our behalf. Class I products like our specimen collection kit are required to meet FDA’s general controls for in vitro diagnostic products, including that they be manufactured in compliance with applicable requirements of the Quality System Regulation for medical devices, adhere to device labeling requirements, and be listed with FDA upon commercial distribution, among other regulatory controls. 
HIPAA and Other Privacy and Data Security Laws 
HIPAA established for the first time comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information, which was expanded and strengthened by Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, applies to health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically, which we refer to collectively as “Covered Entities”, as well as individuals or entities that perform services for them involving the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information or "protected health information" under HIPAA. Such service providers are called "Business Associates." Under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by Covered Entities and Business Associates (“HIPAA Regulations”). HIPAA also regulates and standardizes the codes, formats and identifiers used in certain healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers, for example insurance billing. Any non-compliance with HIPAA and HITECH and related penalties, could adversely impact our business.
HIPAA Regulations impose privacy rules that protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients a variety of rights, including the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. 
The HIPAA Regulations also specify security standards require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. HIPAA requires Covered Entities and Business Associates to enter into business associate agreements. 
HIPAA Regulations also require breach notification. Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected 
Table of Contents

individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. To avoid penalties for failure to comply with breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of unsecured protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach and at risk of significant reputational harm if we experience a large-scale data breach.
We are currently subject to the HIPAA Regulations as a Covered Entity and maintain an active compliance program. We are subject to audit under the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ HITECH-mandated audit program. We may also be investigated in connection with a privacy or data security complaint or reported breach. Significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties may be imposed for violating HIPAA directly, and in connection with acts or omissions of any agents, including a downstream business associates, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Civil penalties are adjusted for inflation on an annual basis and can exceed one million dollars per year for failure to comply with a HIPAA requirement. A single breach incident can violate multiple requirements. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses PHI in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalties (including fines and imprisonment), which increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use PHI for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Covered entities are also subject to enforcement by state Attorneys General who were given authority to enforce HIPAA.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC and states' Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and comparable state laws.In addition to the federal privacy regulatory regime, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to clinical laboratories. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. For example, several states, such as California, have implemented comprehensive privacy laws and regulations. The California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (“CMIA”) imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. In addition to CMIA, California also recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered businesses, and provides new privacy rights for California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. It also creates new privacy rights for California residents and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although then law includes limited exceptions, including for PHI maintained by a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and medical information maintained by healthcare providers under the CMIA, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) went into effect on January 1, 2023, amending the CCPA. The CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California Privacy Protection Agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and is expected to result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The CPRA also extends the provisions of both the CCPA and the CPRA to the personal information of our California-based employees. In addition to California, more U.S. states are enacting similar legislation, increasing compliance complexity and increasing risks of failures to comply. In 2023, comprehensive privacy laws in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah will all take effect.
Many states, such as Massachusetts, have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and requirements for protecting test results. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify.
Table of Contents

The applicability and requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with applicable health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
We anticipate expanding our business internationally, which would implicate international laws governing the privacy of health information and personal data as well as restrictions on the cross-border transfer of these data. We currently receive samples from Canada and must comply with applicable Canadian federal and provincial laws. Compliance with these laws and with other international regulatory requirements is a complex, time and expense consuming endeavor. Our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions 
We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law or the Physician Self-Referral Law, and to similar state restrictions such as California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, commonly known as PORA. Together these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing the Medicare or Medicaid program or any patient or commercial payor for a test when the physician ordering the test, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 
Both the Stark Law and PORA contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to the Stark Law and PORA. However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with the Stark Law, PORA or similar state laws. 
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required to commit a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following: 
•denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition; 
•refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law; 
•a substantial civil penalty for each service arising out of the prohibited referral; 
•exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and 
•substantial civil penalties for parties entering into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibition. 
Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law, PORA and similar laws of other states, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide an assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review. 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. 
Anti-Kickback Statutes 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. 
Table of Contents

The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash, and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of services covered by the federal health care programs, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, kickback allegations can give rise to violations of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed in more detail below. 
Recognizing that the Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) for the United States Department of Health and Human Services to issue a series of regulations known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, immunize the parties to the transaction or arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, transactions and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG. 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, in October 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”) was enacted as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (“SUPPORT Act”). EKRA is an all-payor anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. Further, certain of EKRA’s exceptions are inconsistent with the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor regulations. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued. Further, there is no agency guidance or court precedent to indicate how and to what extent it will be applied and enforced. We cannot assure you that our relationships with physicians, sales representatives, hospitals, customers, or any other party will not be subject to scrutiny or will survive regulatory challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the EKRA could have a negative effect on our business.
Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have pursued cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing, and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. 
Federal False Claims Act 
Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. 
In addition, various states have enacted false claims law analogous to the False Claims Act. Some of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any commercial payor and not merely a federal healthcare program, and some authorize private citizens to bring suit on the state’s behalf. 
When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus per-claim civil penalties, as set by statute and attorney’s fees. The civil penalty amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. Violation of the False Claims Act also can result in exclusion from government health care programs.
While we are unaware of any pending False Claims Act investigations or litigation, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance. 
Table of Contents

Physician Sunshine Laws 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them (and in some cases their distributors) to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reporting program (known as the Open Payments program) is administered by CMS. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We may become subject to such reporting requirements under the terms of current CMS regulations, however, if the FDA requires us to obtain premarket clearance or approval for our tests. 
Corporate Practice of Medicine 
Numerous states prohibit business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. The prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine is designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining the appropriate diagnostic tests for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of a patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, constitutes the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the business corporation and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. 
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (the “CMP Law”), prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Reimbursement and Billing
Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as commercial insurers, including managed care organizations (“MCO”), as well as state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements with which laboratories must comply to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. 
In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, certain clinical laboratories are required to report to CMS commercial payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. Further, under PAMA, Medicare reimbursement for diagnostic tests are based on the weighted- median of the payments made by commercial payors for these tests, rendering commercial payor payment levels even more significant. As a result, future Medicare payments may fluctuate more often and become subject to the willingness of commercial payors to recognize the value of diagnostic tests generally and any given test individually.
In March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which included a provision that delays the next PAMA reporting period for clinical laboratory tests that are not advanced diagnostic tests to January 1, 2022 through March 31, 2022. Then, on December 10, 2021, the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act (S. 610) delayed the reporting requirement as well as the application of the 15% phase-in reduction until 2023. On December 29, 2022, Section 4114 of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 again delayed the next data reporting period for CDLTs that are not ADLTs. The next data reporting period of January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024, will be based on the original data collection period of January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019. 
We cannot predict whether or when these or other recently enacted healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or how any such legislation or regulation may affect us. For instance, the changes to reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare for tests such as ours based on the procedure set forth in PAMA could limit the prices we would 
Table of Contents

be able to charge or the amount of available reimbursement for our tests, which would reduce our revenue. Additionally, these healthcare policy changes could be amended or additional healthcare initiatives could be implemented in the future.
Other Laws Applicable to Our Business
In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without a certification of patient consent by the clinician ordering the test.
In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste, and radioactive materials. For example, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the United States. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the United States Department of Transportation, the United States Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service, and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, and radioactive materials and contractually requires them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Advertising of Laboratory Services or LDTs
Our physician-directed advertising for the DermTech Melanoma Test, the Smart Sticker and our laboratory services, as well as our direct-to-consumer advertising and social media presence, are subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
In general, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”) prohibits offering to pay, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business for or with, or in order to direct business to, any person. The prohibitions apply not only to payments made to “any foreign official,” but also those made to “any foreign political party or official thereof,” to “any candidate for foreign political office” or to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of the payment will be offered, given, or promised to anyone in any of the foregoing categories. “Foreign officials” under the FCPA include officers or employees of a department, agency, or instrumentality of a foreign government. The term “instrumentality” is broad and can include state-owned or state-controlled entities. Importantly, United States authorities deem most healthcare professionals and other employees of foreign hospitals, clinics, research facilities and medical schools in countries with public healthcare and/or public education systems to be “foreign officials” under the FCPA. When we interact with foreign healthcare professionals and researchers in testing and marketing our products abroad, we must have policies and procedures in place sufficient to prevent us and agents acting on our behalf from providing any bribe, gift or gratuity, including excessive or lavish meals, travel or entertainment in connection with marketing our products and services or securing required permits and approvals. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. We have a policy entitled “Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption” that seeks to fully comply with the FCPA. 
Foreign Regulations 
When we market our tests outside of the United States, we will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States, and may require us to implement

additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In the European Union, we may be subject to newly enacted legislation that imposes requirements and restrictions on medical devices and in vitro diagnostics.
In addition, we will also be subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) that significantly regulates the possession, use, and disclosure of personal information. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing, and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, our books and records provisions, and our anti-bribery provisions. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 279 employees, 278 of which were full-time employees, including 21 engaged in research and development, 17 in clinical operations, 87 in general and administrative, 36 in laboratory operations, and 118 in sales and marketing. We also engage consultants in various areas. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relationships with our employees and contractors are good.
