History 
Flowserve Corporation as it exists today was created in 1997 through the merger of two leading fluid motion and control companies — BW/IP and Durco International. Under the name of a predecessor entity, we were incorporated in the State of New York on May 1, 1912, but some of our heritage product brand names date back to our founding in 1790. Over the years, we have evolved through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, and our over 225-year history of Flowserve heritage brands serves as the foundation for the breadth and depth of our products and services today. 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND PRODUCTS
Our Primary Industries
We sell our products and services to approximately 10,000 companies, including some of the world’s leading engineering, procurement and construction firms ("EPC"), original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries having a broad geographic reach. Our total bookings in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $4.4 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Our bookings mix by industry in 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of:

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
• oil and gas | 40 | % | | 35 | % | 34 | %
• general industries(1) | 22 | % | | 26 | % | 26 | %
• chemical(2) | 22 | % | | 24 | % | 24 | %
• power generation | 12 | % | | 12 | % | 13 | %
• water management | 4 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %

(1)General industries include mining and ore processing, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, as well as sales to distributors whose end customers typically operate in the other industries we primarily serve as identified above. 
(2)Chemical industry is comprised of chemical-based and pharmaceutical products. Demand
Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment as well as planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for products that rely on oil and gas, chemicals, power generation and water resource management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior, including changes in demand for certain products and processes as a result of evolving industry trends and needs. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process.
Sales Channels
Sales to EPC firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects that are longer-cycle projects and can take up to two years.
In contrast to large project orders, the quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as "short-cycle," is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped generally within six months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services, and are less cyclical than larger capital expenditures driven by project orders. Each of our two business segments generates certain levels of this type of short-cycle business.
In the sale of aftermarket products and services (collectively referred to as "aftermarket"), we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires periodic maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick 
response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to selectively expand our global QRC capabilities to improve our ability to capture an increasing portion of this important aftermarket business. Each of our two business segments generates certain levels of aftermarket products and services. 
We have pursued a strategy of industry diversity and geographic breadth to mitigate the impact on our business of normal economic downturns in any one of the industries or in any particular part of the world we serve. In addition, to augment our focus on growth we have initiated a diversify, decarbonize and digitize growth strategy ("3D Strategy"). The 3D Strategy focuses on diversifying end markets to create a more balanced portfolio, supporting customers through the energy transition and leveraging technology and data to improve customer operations and provide solutions.
For events that may occur and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 ("Annual Report"). For information on our sales and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Annual Report. 
Business Functions
Our segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively. All segments share certain resources and functions, including elements of research and development ("R&D"), supply chain, safety, quality assurance and administrative functions that provide efficiencies and an overall lower cost structure. 
Our operations leadership reports to our Chief Executive Officer and the segments share leadership for operational support functions such as R&D, marketing and supply chain. We believe this leadership structure positions the Company to leverage operational excellence, cost reduction initiatives and internal synergies across our entire operating platform to drive further growth and increase in shareholder value. 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We report a two operating segment structure, consisting of our Flowserve Pumps Division and our Flow Control Division. In addition to the business segment information presented below, Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report contains additional financial information about our business segments and geographic areas in which we have conducted business in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
FLOWSERVE PUMP DIVISION
Our largest business segment is the Flowserve Pump Division ("FPD"), through which we design, manufacture, pretest, distribute and service specialty and highly-engineered custom and pre-configured pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems, replacement parts and upgrades and related aftermarket services. FPD products and services are primarily used by companies that operate in the oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and general industries. We market our pump and mechanical seal products through our global sales force and our regional QRCs and service and repair centers or through independent distributors and sales representatives. A portion of our mechanical seal products are sold directly to other original equipment manufacturers for incorporation into their rotating equipment requiring mechanical seals.
Our pump products are manufactured in a wide range of metal alloys and with a variety of configurations to reliably meet the operating requirements of our customers. Mechanical seals are critical to the reliable operation of rotating equipment in that they prevent leakage and emissions of hazardous substances from the rotating equipment and reduce shaft wear on the equipment caused by the use of non-mechanical seals. We also manufacture a gas-lubricated mechanical seal that is used in high-speed compressors for gas pipelines and in the oil and gas production and process markets. Our products are currently manufactured in 35 manufacturing facilities worldwide, 10 of which are located in Europe, 11 in North America, eight in Asia Pacific and six in Latin America, and we have 132 QRCs, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities and/or shared with our Flow Control Division ("FCD").
We also conduct business through strategic foreign joint ventures. We have five unconsolidated joint ventures that are located in Chile, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, where a portion of our products are 
manufactured, assembled or serviced in these territories. These relationships provide numerous strategic opportunities, including increased access to our current and new markets, access to additional manufacturing capacity and expansion of our operational platform to support best-cost sourcing initiatives and balance capacity demands for other markets.
FPD Products
We manufacture more than 40 different active types of pumps, including American Petroleum Institute ("API") process pumps used in many downstream refining and petrochemical processing systems, and single case multistage axially split heavy duty pumps often used for high pressure hydrocarbon pipeline transmission. In addition, we manufacture double case diffuser style barrel pumps for medium duty applications in refining and petrochemical applications and submersible pump for deep well pumping in irrigation and municipal water supply service. We also manufacture approximately 185 different models of mechanical seals and sealing systems. Our pump products are sold under globally recognized brands in some cases dating back as far as 225 years ago, including Worthington, SIHI, Durco and Innomag. As announced in 2022, Flowserve also produces FLEX, a pressure exchange device for mainly the desalination market.
FPD Services 
We also provide engineered aftermarket services through our global network of 132 QRCs, some of which are co-located in manufacturing facilities, in 45 countries. Our FPD service personnel provide a comprehensive set of equipment services for flow management control systems, including installation, commissioning services, seal systems spare parts, repairs, advanced diagnostics, re-rate and upgrade solutions and retrofit programs, machining and comprehensive asset management solutions. We provide asset management services and condition monitoring for rotating equipment through special contracts with many of our customers that reduce maintenance costs. A large portion of FPD’s service work is performed on a quick response basis and we offer 24-hour service in all of our major markets.
FPD New Product Development 
Our investments in new product R&D continue to focus on increasing the capability of our products as customer applications become more advanced, demanding greater levels of production (i.e., flow and power) and under more extreme conditions (i.e., erosive, corrosive and temperature) beyond the level of traditional technology. We continue to invest in our product platform and develop innovations to improve our competitive position in our key markets, including the global chemical industry and in the engineered equipment industry, specifically upstream, offshore and downstream applications for the oil and gas market. Continued engagement with our end users is exemplified through the completion of advancements that significantly improve energy efficiency, reduce total cost-of-ownership and enhance safety. 
As the world continues to undergo energy transition in the coming years, significant investment towards renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency solutions will become increasingly more important. We continue to develop new product designs to support our customers through energy transition in our key end markets. We have launched and will continue to launch new initiatives to support renewable energy, energy efficiency, emissions reduction, decarbonization, and sustainability as the world continues to embrace energy transition into the future. Product development and continued improvements in these areas is a key aspect of our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) program.
In addition, we continue to advance our capabilities and technology position in the rapidly developing segment known as the Industrial Internet of Things ("IIoT"). Over the past several years we have continued to both invest and partner in this space to build remote monitoring solutions, as well as advanced equipment diagnostics in order to provide remote asset management and related services capabilities for our end-user customers. Our IIoT solution, RedRaven, includes delivering intelligent “edge” devices, advanced networking infrastructure and secure communication and security protocols, secure data management, and remote monitoring and reporting for our customers. In addition, we have moved beyond exploring new additive manufacturing capabilities, such as 3D printing and fast casting methods, and are exploring ways to economically scale these techniques as another means of manufacturing our products to both reduce lead time and lower our production costs.
None of these newly developed products or services required the investment of a material amount of our assets or was otherwise material to our business. Flowserve continues to develop cryogenic hydrogen pumping products and technology in connection with a third party technology partnership which began in 2022. Furthermore, Flowserve has continued to develop and commercialize new products with greater efficiency and capacity in the pressure exchanger portfolio.
FPD Customers
Our customer mix is diversified and includes leading EPC firms, major national oil companies, international oil companies, equipment end users in our served markets, other original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. Our sales mix of original equipment products and aftermarket products and services diversifies our business and helps mitigate the impact of normal economic cycles on our business. Our sales are diversified among several industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and general industries.
FPD Competition
The pump and mechanical seal industry is highly fragmented, with thousands of competitors globally. We compete, however, primarily with a limited number of large companies operating on a global scale. There are also a number of smaller, newer entrants in some of our emerging markets. Competition among our closest competitors is generally driven by delivery times, application knowledge, experience, expertise, price, breadth of product offerings, contractual terms, previous installation history and reputation for quality. Some of our largest industry competitors include: Sulzer Pumps; Ebara Corp.; SPX FLOW, Inc.; Eagle Burgmann, which is a joint venture of two traditional global seal manufacturers, A. W. Chesterton Co. and AES Corp.; John Crane Inc., a unit of Smiths Group Plc; Weir Group Plc.; ITT Industries; and KSB SE & Co. KGaA.
The pump and mechanical seal industry continues to undergo considerable consolidation, which is primarily driven by (i) the need to lower costs through reduction of excess capacity and (ii) customers’ preference to align with global full service suppliers to simplify their supplier base. Despite the consolidation activity, the market remains highly competitive. 
We believe that our strongest sources of competitive advantage rest with our extensive range of pumps for the oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical and power generation industries, our large installed base of products, our strong customer relationships, our high quality technology, our more than 225 years of experience in manufacturing and servicing pumping equipment, our reputation for providing quality engineering solutions and our ability to deliver engineered new seal product orders within 72 hours from the customer’s request.
FPD Backlog
FPD’s backlog of orders as of December 31, 2022 was $2,008.9 million, compared with $1,368.9 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 77% of December 31, 2022 backlog during 2023.

We believe that our strongest sources of competitive advantage rest with our comprehensive portfolio of valve and automation products and services, our ability to provide complementary pump and rotating equipment products and services, our focus on execution, our expertise in severe corrosion and erosion applications, and strategic partnerships purposely built to advance market adoption of new technologies and digital tools.
FCD Backlog
FCD’s backlog of orders as of December 31, 2022 was $745.5 million, compared with $639.8 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 90% of December 31, 2022 backlog during 2023.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING BOTH REPORTING SEGMENTS
Seasonality 
Our financial results are traditionally seasonal, as we typically experience lower earnings in the first quarter of the year, with lower sales, coupled with fixed operating expenses, impacting our earnings and cash flows. We typically have higher sales, earnings and cash flows in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being the strongest. Given that certain of our operating expenses are fixed, fluctuations in sales volumes from quarter to quarter may affect operating income for the respective quarters.
Selling and Distribution
We primarily distribute our products through direct sales by employees assigned to specific regions, industries or products. In addition, we use distributors and sales representatives to supplement our direct sales force where it is more economically efficient. We generate a majority of our sales leads through existing relationships with vendors, customers and prospects or through referrals.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are unencumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. In limited circumstances, we have entered into agreements to license intellectual property. The operational and financial terms of these agreements are not material. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our existing patents generally expire 10 to 20 years from the dates they were filed, which has occurred at various times in the past. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products include ferrous and non-ferrous metals in the form of bar stock, machined castings, fasteners, forgings and motors, as well as silicon, carbon faces, gaskets and fluoropolymer components. A substantial volume of our raw materials is purchased from outside sources, and we have been able to develop a robust supply chain. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our suppliers have experienced varying lengths of production and shipping delays related to the pandemic, some of which continue to exist in highly affected countries. Additionally, global supply chain and logistics constraints affecting global markets caused additional headwinds throughout 2022. We have also experienced, and continue to experience, increased cost inflation throughout our supply chain. Throughout 2022, our operating costs were impacted by inflation, including with respect to the cost of certain raw materials, packaging and freight, as well as wage and benefit costs. 
These conditions have had an adverse effect on the speed at which we can manufacture and ship our products to customers, and have also led to an increase in logistics, transportation and freight costs, requiring that we diversify our supply chain and, in some instances, source materials from new suppliers. We continually monitor the business conditions of our suppliers to manage competitive market conditions and to avoid potential supply disruptions wherever possible. We continue to expand global sourcing to capitalize on localization in emerging markets and low-cost sources of purchased goods balanced with efficient consolidated and compliant logistics. The combined effects of supply chain disruption, inflation and the strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect our ability to source raw materials from our suppliers.
Metal castings used in the manufacture of our pump, valve, and mechanical seals are purchased from qualified and approved foundry sources. We remain vertically integrated with metal castings in certain strategic product families. 
Concerning the products we supply to customers in the nuclear power generation industry, suppliers of raw materials for nuclear power generation markets must be qualified to meet the requirements of nuclear industry standards and governmental regulations. Supply channels for these materials are currently adequate, and we do not anticipate difficulty in obtaining such materials in the future.

We also provide associates with compliance trainings on relevant topics such as trade, anti-corruption, anti-trust, investigations and data privacy.
Culture and Engagement: To further enhance our culture, we conduct biannual employee engagement surveys to solicit feedback and input directly from our associates. In 2022, approximately 80% of our associates participated in our employee engagement survey. The Company put action to the survey results by empowering leaders with results summaries and personalized action planning support to further advance our culture and values at a local level. 
Flowserve also seeks to build a diverse and inclusive culture through our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program. Flowserve participates in regular national and global observances by sharing educational content with employees that raises awareness of cultural celebrations and experiences. Through these observances, we believe we can inspire mutual understanding and greater empathy across our global workforce. As a multi-national organization, recognition and education of cultural observances is an important part of creating a greater understanding and appreciation for our associates' experiences and for the experiences of our global customer base. 
In addition, in 2022 management received education and training on unconscious bias and leading with inclusivity. With these programs and educational opportunities, we hope to foster an employee culture that drives inclusion, combats bias and positively impacts our communities in and outside of Flowserve. 
In 2022, we continued our journey to advance our culture of inclusion through partnership with McKinsey’s Black Leadership Academy, a virtual program offered to Black managers and leaders who aspire to take the challenging leap into senior leadership. The program focuses on building core management and leadership capabilities, developing the cross-functional knowledge needed to lead successful businesses and teams, and on strengthening personal networks. The 45-hour program supported our leaders in their personal and professional development.
Another avenue to foster our culture is through our employee recognition program, the Spirit of Flowserve. This program supports our business strategy, our values and our vision to drive an innovative culture, customer-centric mindset, 
employee engagement and talent retention. In 2022, over 21,000 awards were given through the Spirit of Flowserve program for exceptional achievement and positive impact to the Company. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Activities
We structure our approach to sustainability around ESG principles that incorporate our values and business priorities so that all of our associates can contribute to our ESG priorities. Our ESG program is centered on three key pillars – climate, culture and core responsibility. Climate captures the environmental pillar of our ESG approach and outlines our commitment to enabling a clean energy future for our operations and our customers. Culture refers to the social pillar of our ESG strategy and is rooted in our belief that the collective energy of our people set us apart.  It defines our commitment to strengthening our values-driven culture and investing in our communities through talent recruitment and engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace health and safety, and employee well-being.  Core responsibility represents governance and how we seek to conduct business ethically and in accordance with laws and regulations around the world.
We publish an annual ESG Report that discusses our ESG-related goals, activities and accomplishments, which can be accessed through the “Investor Relations” section of our Internet web site, and which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental Regulations and Proceedings 
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we have operating facilities. These requirements primarily relate to the generation and disposal of waste, air emissions and wastewater discharges. We periodically make capital expenditures to enhance our compliance with environmental requirements, as well as to abate and control pollution. At present, we have no plans for any material capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at any of our facilities. However, we have incurred and continue to incur operating costs relating to ongoing environmental compliance matters. Based on existing and proposed environmental requirements and our anticipated production schedule, we believe that future environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations. Most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes and some may require clean-up of historical contamination. During the due diligence phase of our acquisitions, we conduct environmental site assessments to identify potential environmental liabilities and required clean-up measures. We are currently conducting follow-up investigation and/or remediation activities at those locations where we have known environmental concerns. We have cleaned up a majority of the sites with known historical contamination and are addressing the remaining identified issues.
Over the years, we have been involved as one of many potentially responsible parties ("PRP") at former public waste disposal sites that are or were subject to investigation and remediation. We are currently involved as a PRP at four Superfund sites. The sites are in various stages of evaluation by government authorities. Our total projected "fair share" cost allocation at these four sites is expected to be immaterial. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" included in this Annual Report for more information.
We have established reserves that we currently believe to be adequate to cover our currently identified on-site and off-site environmental liabilities.
Exports
Our export sales from the U.S. to foreign unaffiliated customers were $246.6 million in 2022, $263.1 million in 2021 and $264.6 million in 2020.
Licenses are required from U.S. and other government agencies to export certain products. In particular, products with nuclear power generation and/or military applications are restricted, as are certain other pump, valve and seal products.
