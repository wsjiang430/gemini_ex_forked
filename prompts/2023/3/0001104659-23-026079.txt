ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 

Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Clarus Corporation (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a global leading designer, developer, manufacturer and distributor of best-in-class outdoor equipment and lifestyle products focused on the outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. Our mission is to identify, acquire and grow outdoor “super fan” brands through our unique “innovate and accelerate” strategy. We define a “super fan” brand as a brand that creates the world’s pre-eminent, performance-defining product that the best-in-class user cannot live without. Each of our brands has a long history of continuous product innovation for core and everyday users alike. The Company’s products are principally sold globally under the Black Diamond®, Sierra®, Barnes®, Rhino-Rack® and MAXTRAX® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our own websites, distributors and original equipment manufacturers. Our portfolio of iconic brands is well-positioned for sustainable, long-term growth underpinned by powerful industry trends across the outdoor and adventure sport end markets.

One of the key elements of our sustained financial performance is our persistent focus on brand building through product initiatives. Our iconic brands are rooted in performance-defining technologies that enable our customers to have their best days outdoors. We have a long history of technical innovation and product development, backed by an extensive patent portfolio that continues to evolve and advance our markets. We currently employ approximately 120 engineers across the portfolio, focusing on enhancing our customers’ performance in the most critical moments. Our commitment to quality, rigorous safety, and ultimately best-in-class design is evidenced by outstanding industry recognition, as we have received numerous product awards across our portfolio of super fan brands.

Each of our brands represents a unique customer value proposition. Supported by six decades of proven innovation, Black Diamond is an established global leader in high-performance, activity-based climbing, skiing, and technical mountain sports equipment. The brand is synonymous with premium performance, safety and reliability. Our Sierra and Barnes brands have been leading specialty manufacturers of bullets and ammunition for over 50 years. Since 1947, Sierra has been dedicated to manufacturing the highest-quality, most accurate bullets in the world for hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts. Barnes traces its history back to 1932, and since 1989 has manufactured technologically-advanced, lead-free bullets and premium ammunition for hunters, range shooters, military and law enforcement professionals. Founded in 1992, our Rhino-Rack brand is a globally-recognized designer and distributor of highly-engineered automotive roof racks and accessories to enhance the outdoor enthusiast’s overlanding experience. Founded in 2005, our MAXTRAX brand offers high-quality overlanding and off-road vehicle recovery and extraction tracks for the overland and off-road market.

Clarus, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, acquired Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“Black Diamond Equipment”) in May 2010 and changed its name to Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively, “PIEPS”). On August 14, 2017, the Company changed its name from Black Diamond, Inc. to Clarus Corporation and its stock ticker symbol from “BDE” to “CLAR” on the NASDAQ stock exchange. 

On August 21, 2017, the Company acquired Sierra Bullets, L.L.C. (“Sierra”). On November 6, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of SKINourishment, Inc. (“SKINourishment”). On October 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities constituting the Barnes business (“Barnes”). On July 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based Rhino-Rack Holdings Pty Ltd (“Rhino-Rack”). On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based MaxTrax Australia Pty Ltd (“MAXTRAX”).

Market Overview

Our brands participate in the outdoor-oriented lifestyle that has and is expected to benefit from favorable long-term growth trends. The users of our products are loyal outdoor enthusiasts, including climbers, mountaineers, trail runners, skiers, mountain bikers, backpackers and campers, competitive shooters, hunters, adventure seekers, overlanders and other outdoor-inspired consumers. We believe we have a strong reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety and durability in our core product lines, positioning us for sustainable growth amidst the acceleration of our market opportunity. Select factors driving this acceleration include:

Increasing Adoption of Outdoor Lifestyles and Focus on Health and Wellness. According to Outdoor Foundation, over the past decade, many outdoor activities have experienced a consistent rise in participation rates. This heightened participation has grown in tandem with increasing consumer focus on health and wellness with many consumers acutely aware of the myriad of physical and mental health benefits associated with outdoor activities. 

Growing Demand for SUVs as “Staycations,” Road Trips and Short Breaks Increase in Popularity. Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that outdoor participation and the desire for more localized vacation trips experienced an uplift as consumers actively sought activities that conform to local social distancing guidelines, and avoided air and rail travel. We anticipate 

 
that the continuing impact of rising energy costs and inflation, along with positive memories consumers have from their previous pandemic “staycations”, will continue this trend of localized travel. In addition, the popularity of pickups and, more recently, their sibling sport utility vehicles (“SUVs”) and crossover utility vehicles (“CUVs”) continues to rise. They are multipurpose vehicles, proving equally functional for daily commutes, heavy jobsite work or recreational and trail activities. Per the 2022 issue of “SEMA Light-Truck Snapshot,” the light-truck segment — which includes pickups, vans, SUVs and CUVs — is forecast to account for 80% of all new passenger vehicle sales by 2028. The demand for vehicles geared towards local travel is driving demand for extra luggage space and the automotive rack market, which is expected to directly benefit our Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX brands.

Rise of Overlanding. Combining off-road driving with backcountry lifestyle activities, such as camping, hiking, kayaking and mountain biking, we believe that overlanding has driven a new niche in the light truck, SUV and CUV segment for enthusiasts and light truck manufacturers, which is expected to directly benefit our Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX brands. Per SEMA, overlanding, loosely defined, is the practice of exploring the backcountry in a purpose-built vehicle — generally, a high-clearance four-wheel drive — that is equipped to allow its occupants to remain self-sufficient for periods of time ranging from a few days to several weeks. Overlanding originated in Australia, with popularity in South America and sub-Saharan Africa, but its popularity in North America has grown over the past decade.

Due to its overlap with numerous outdoor lifestyle activities, overlanding’s market growth is difficult to precisely measure, but we believe that the global adventure tourism market — which includes camping, hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, rafting and other pursuits that are closely associated with overlanding — reflects this growing trend and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.

Climbing Verticals Becoming Mainstream. With the release of critically acclaimed free climbing documentary The Dawn Wall as well as the Academy Award-winning rock climbing documentary Free Solo, mainstream consumers are increasingly exposed to the markets that Clarus and, specifically, Black Diamond work to serve. Furthermore, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics marked the first time that sport climbing debuted in an Olympic stadium, bringing the thrills of high-skill rock climbing to the living rooms of people across the globe. The 2024 Paris Summer Olympics will also include sport climbing events.

Resurgence in Popularity of Hunting. After several years of falling participation, we believe that hunting continues to experience a resurgence as a popular outdoor activity. Additionally, the sport of hunting has experienced more diversity in participants, specifically women and younger people. The investment in hunting equipment and required training courses is expected to drive sustained activity in the sport.

As the variety of outdoor sports activities continues to proliferate, and existing outdoor sports evolve and become more specialized, we believe there is demand in the marketplace to address the unique technical and performance needs of such enthusiasts. We believe we have been able to help address this opportunity by seeking to leverage our intimate knowledge of what the customer needs to perform at the highest level. We continue to seek to improve on our existing product lines by expanding our offerings into new niche categories, and by incorporating innovative industrial design, engineering and performance tolerances into our products. We believe the credibility and authenticity of our brands expands our potential market beyond committed outdoor athletes to outdoor generalists who desire to lead active, outdoor-focused lifestyles.

Growth Strategies

Our growth strategies are to achieve sustainable, profitable growth organically while seeking to expand our business through targeted, strategic acquisitions. We intend to create new and innovative products, increase consumer and retailer awareness and demand for our products, and build stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time across an increasing number of geographic markets. Additionally, long-term growth is underpinned by powerful industry trends across the outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. Our growth initiatives include, but are not limited to the following:

Black Diamond Product Category Expansions. Within our Outdoor segment, we intend to utilize our “innovate and accelerate” strategy to leverage our strong brand name, customer relationships, proven capacity to develop new innovative products and product extensions in each of our existing product categories, and to expand into new product categories. Our new technologies are generally inspired by our continuing commitment to maximize the enjoyment and efficacy of the products for the outdoor sports for which we design. We intend to focus on the expansion of our apparel and footwear categories, driving further innovation in lights, trekking poles, snow safety, and climbing hard goods, while broadening our appeal in gloves and packs.

Growth in International Markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the presence and penetration of each of our brands globally. The European alpine market is currently significantly larger than the U.S. market and is highly fragmented by country, with no clear leader across Europe. We have been able to gain market share by emphasizing our Black Diamond brand, positioning it as a global brand with American roots. We believe there is also a significant opportunity to expand our Sierra and Barnes brands outside the U.S. market through additional sales and marketing commitments. The acquisition of Rhino-Rack adds a leading market position in Australia and New Zealand, with an opportunity to grow our presence in the U.S., currently less than 1% market share, through key partnerships with brick-and-mortar and online retailers alike, and enhanced brand awareness. Our most recent acquisition, MAXTRAX, 

 
has a leading market position in Australia and we believe it has a significant opportunity to grow in the U.S.

Acquisition of Complementary Businesses. We expect to target acquisitions as a viable opportunity to gain access to new product group and customer channels, and increase penetration of existing markets. We may also pursue acquisitions that diversify the Company within the outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. To the extent we pursue future acquisitions, we intend to focus on super-fan brands with recurring revenue, sustainable margins and strong cash flow generation. We anticipate financing future acquisitions prudently through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flow, bank financings, and capital markets offerings.

Growth-oriented Capital Structure. Our capital structure provides us with the capacity to fund future growth.

We typically bring new products from concept to market in approximately 18 to 36 months, depending upon the technology integration and complexity of the product. We work simultaneously on product lines for the four subsequent selling seasons.

We expense research and development costs as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we had 110 employees dedicated to research and development.

Customers

We market and distribute our products in over 50 countries, primarily through independent specialty stores and specialty chains, premium sporting goods and outdoor recreation stores, distributors and OEMs in the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and South America. Outside of North America and Europe, we sell our products through independent global distributors into specialty retail stores. We also sell our products directly to customers through our various websites.

Our end users include a broad range of consumers, including mountain, rock, ice, and gym climbers, winter-outdoor enthusiasts, trail runners, backpackers, competitive shooters, hunters, and outdoor-inspired consumers. Such consumers demand high-quality, reliable, and high-precision products to enhance their performance and, in some cases, safety in a multitude of outdoor activities. We expect to leverage our user intimacy, engineering prowess, and design ability to expand into related technical product categories that target the same demographic group and distribution channels.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales force is generally deployed by geographic region: Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Australia, and the United States. Our focus is on providing our products to a broad spectrum of outdoor enthusiasts. Within each of our brands, we strive to create a unique look for our products and to communicate those differences to the consumer. In addition, we are continuously exploring uses for brand and market research. We also regularly utilize various promotions and public relations campaigns.

We have consistently established relationships with professional athletes and influencers to help evaluate, promote and establish product performance and authenticity with customers. Such brand endorsers are one of many elements in our array of marketing materials, including instore displays, catalogs, workbooks, social media, and digital campaigns via our websites.

Manufacturing, Sourcing, Quality Assurance and Distribution

Manufacturing

Our objective is to deliver on-time the highest quality of products in the safest and most cost-efficient manner.  Our culture of continuous improvement and implementation of industry best practices allows us to continue to increase productivity, reduce costs, and bring new innovative products to the market. 

The Black Diamond Equipment, PIEPS, Rhino-Rack, and MAXTRAX manufacturing and distribution operations are ISO 9001–2015 certified and are audited annually by an independent certifying agency to ensure quality management systems meet the requirements of ISO 9001–2015, and to ensure that certified products meet all necessary performance certification requirements. Sierra and Barnes are members of the Sporting Arms & Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute and employ best-in-class proprietary manufacturing processes with respect to each one of its products. These processes are performed in-house and include control of bullet jacket wall concentricity utilizing strict quality control standards overseen by experienced employees, yielding what we believe to be the tightest tolerances in the industry. 

We manufacture approximately 25% to 30% of our products, including nearly all protection devices for climbing and all bullets, in our facilities in the United States. The remaining approximately 70% to 75% of our products are also manufactured to our specifications in third-party, independently-owned facilities. We keep employees and agents on-site or via regular visits at these third-party, independently-owned facilities to ensure that our products are manufactured to meet our specifications. While we do not maintain a long-term manufacturing contract with those facilities, we believe that our long-term relationships with them will help to ensure that a sufficient supply of goods built to our specification are available in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms in the future.



Sourcing

We source raw materials, components, finished goods from a variety of suppliers. Our primary materials include copper, lead, aluminum, steel, nylon, corrugated cardboard for packaging, metal, plastic and electrical components, and various textiles, foams, and fabrics. The raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are generally available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal requirements.

We source packaging materials both domestically as well as from sources in Asia and Europe. We believe that all of our purchased products and materials could be readily obtained from alternative sources at comparable costs.

Quality Assurance

Quality assurance at the Company has two primary functions:

The first is to ensure that the products that we design and develop are manufactured to meet or exceed the Company’s own standards and international regulatory standards. This involves creating inspection documentation, reviewing manufacturing processes with our various vendor-partners, and inspecting finished product to assure it meets the rigorous standards required by our customers. These activities take place globally, wherever our products are manufactured.
The second function is to provide real and meaningful input to the new product development process. Quality assurance professionals interact closely with the design and engineering teams and bring knowledge and expertise to the design process, ensuring that the products we bring to market truly meet the criteria established when a new product is envisioned.
The engineering prowess of the quality assurance group is a core competency that the Company seeks to leverage across all product lines and brands.

Global Distribution

Our distribution model allows us to ship a broad cross-section of our product line in smaller quantities to our own global distribution centers and to those of our Independent Global Distributors (“IGD”) more frequently and at lower transportation and logistics costs.
Competition

Because of the diversity of our product offerings, we compete by niche with a variety of companies. Our products must stand up to the high standards set by the end users in each category where quality, durability and performance are paramount. We believe our products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance, marketing support, and price.

The popularity of various outdoor activities and changing design trends affect the desirability of our products. Therefore, we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings by developing new products with innovative performance features and designs, and by marketing our products in a persuasive and memorable fashion to drive consumer awareness and demand. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

We compete with niche, privately-owned companies as well as a number of brands owned by large, multinational companies, such as those set forth below.

Outdoor: Our outdoor products and accessories, such as apparel, footwear, trekking poles, headlamps, gloves, backpacks, transceivers, protection, carabiners, helmets, and harnesses, compete with products from companies such as The North Face, Patagonia, La Sportiva, Prana, Hestra, Osprey, Arc’Teryx, Petzl, and Mammut.
Precision Sport: We sell bullets and ammunition to both retailers and distributors for sale to consumers. We supply bullets to OEMs who also manufacture bullets. Such companies include Vista (Federal Ammunition, CCI, and Remington), Nammo, Hornady, Fiocchi, and Olin (Winchester).
Adventure: Our highly-engineered automotive roof racks, trays, mounting systems, luggage boxes, carriers, recovery tracks and accessories compete with products from companies such as Thule, Dometic, Yakima, Front Runner, and TRED Outdoors.
In addition, in certain categories we compete with certain of our large wholesale customers who focus on the outdoor market, such as REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op and Decathlon, which manufacture, market and distribute their own climbing, mountaineering, and skiing products under their own private labels.



Intellectual Property

We believe our registered and pending word and icon trademarks worldwide, including the Black Diamond and Diamond “C” logos, Black Diamond®, ATC ®, Camalot®, AvaLung ®, FlickLock®, Ascension™, Time is Life®, Hexentric®, Stopper®, Dawn Patrol®, Bibler®, “Use.Design.Build.Engineer.Repeat”®, Sierra®, Sierra® MatchKing®, Sierra® GameKing®, Sierra® BlitzKing®, Barnes®, TSX®, X Bullet®, VOR-TX®, PIEPS®, Rhino-Rack®, and Maxtrax® create international brand recognition for our products.

Solely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames referred to in this report may appear without the ® and ™ symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and tradenames.

We believe our brands have an established reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety, and durability, and accordingly, we actively monitor and police our brands against infringement to ensure their viability and enforceability.

In addition to trademarks, we hold over 300 patents and over 100 patents pending worldwide for a wide variety of technologies across our product lines.

Our success with our proprietary products is generally derived from our “first mover” advantage in the market as well as our commitment to protecting our current and future proprietary technologies and products, which acts as a deterrent to infringement of our intellectual property rights. While we believe our patent and trademark protection policies are robust and effective, if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights include our patents and trademarks but also include products containing proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing know-how.

We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products. While we actively monitor our competitors to ensure that we do not compromise the intellectual property of others, we cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or void the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are in similar product niches as ours.

Seasonality

The Company’s products are outdoor activity-based, however, there are not significant seasonal variations in sales and profitability. In 2022, approximately 51% of our sales were in the first half of the year while approximately 49% of our sales occurred in the second half of the year.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital generally increases to support peak manufacturing and shipping periods and then decreases as accounts receivable are collected. However, throughout 2022, the Company leveraged our balance sheet to secure additional inventory across all of our brands to ensure the right inventory is available to meet customer demand. 

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those that impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes. We believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not, and we believe in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Regulatory Matters

The manufacture, sale, and purchase of ammunition by our Precision Sport segment are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign governmental laws. Our Precision Sport segment is also subject to the rules and regulations of the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. Such regulations may adversely affect demand for the products sold by our Precision Sport segment by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of its products.



The failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result in the revocation of licenses necessary for business conducted by the Precision Sport segment. Applicable laws and regulations provide for the following:

require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition as a business;
require serialization, labeling, and tracking of the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition;
regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition
restrict or prohibit the ownership, use, or sale of specified categories of ammunition; 
require registries of so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns; 
govern the sale, export, and distribution of ammunition; 
regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
regulate the employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions;
restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions; and
require compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations

The handling of our technical data and the international sale of products sold by our Precision Sport segment may also be regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying the export of the products sold by our Precision Sport segment, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Bills have been introduced in Congress to establish, and to consider the feasibility of establishing, a nationwide database recording so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns. Should such a mandatory database be established, the cost to us, our distributors, and our customers could be significant, depending on the type of firearms and ballistic information included in the database. Bills have been introduced in Congress in the past several years that would affect the manufacture and sale of ammunition, including bills to regulate its manufacture, importation, and sale.

We believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition have not had a material adverse effect on our sales of these products. However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions.

In addition, our SKINourishment business is subject to substantial government regulation. This government regulation includes regulation in the United States and other countries regarding the research, development, formulation, manufacture and marketing of our SKINourishment skincare products.

As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of over 900 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 380 were engaged in manufacturing, 280 in sales, marketing, product management and customer support, 80 in administrative functions (IT, Finance, HR, Legal and Compliance, etc.), 110 in R&D, engineering technology, manufacturing engineering and project management, 50 retail store associates and 20 in various executive and corporate functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. We believe that our employee relations are good. Our human capital objectives center around identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. We maintain and grow our team utilizing practices that help us identify, hire, incentivize and retain our existing employees and integrate new employees into our Company.

Impact of COVID-19

The global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by each of the U.S., European, and Australian governments in March 2020, with governments world-wide implementing safety measures restricting travel and requiring citizen lockdowns and self-confinements for quarantining purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, this had negatively affected the U.S., European, Australian and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in significant transport restrictions and disruption of global financial markets.

An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have, a significant impact on the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on related activities causing disruption and delay, along with increased raw material, storage, and shipping costs. Any of these disruptions and delays may strain domestic and international supply chains, which could negatively affect the flow or availability of certain critical raw materials and finished good products that the Company relies upon. Furthermore, the foregoing impacts may significantly increase demand from online sales channels, including our website, and could impact our logistical operations, including our fulfillment and shipping functions, which may result in periodic delays in the delivery of our products.

 


We expect that an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have, an impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors (some of which are outside management’s control), including those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
