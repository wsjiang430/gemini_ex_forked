AIR POLLUTION CONTROL (APC)
 
Regulations and Markets: Domestic
 
The future growth of our APC technology segment is dependent upon the adoption and enforcement of environmental regulations in the United States (U.S.) and globally. In the U.S., federal and state laws regulating the emission of NOx are the primary driver in our APC technology segment. The principal regulatory drivers currently in effect are as follows:
Clean Air Act (CAA): The CAA requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) at levels that are protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety. The six pollutants specified include: Ozone, Particulate Matter, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Lead, and Carbon Monoxide. The NAAQS provisions require that states comply with ozone and particulate emissions standards. NOx emissions are a precursor to ozone formation and also contribute to fine particulate emissions. Since 1990, EPA rules and programs have been established at the regional and federal level to help states in their mission to define and meet their State Implementation Plans for attainment. The NAAQS ground-level ozone standards that were issued in 1997, were made more stringent in 2008 and again in 2015. The EPA has kept the 2020 NAAQS ozone standard at 70 parts per billion, the same limit as 2015. EPA is evaluating the impact of NOx emissions from upwind sources on downwind states through the Good Neighbor provision of the CAA.  The Good Neighbor provision may require upwind sources to provide additional NOx controls to help downwind states meet the 2020 ozone NAAQS requirements over the next several years.
Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR): The CAVR, also known as the Regional Haze rule, is part of the Clean Air Act and was finalized in 2005. Under CAVR, certain States are required to submit implementation plans to the EPA to comply with the Regional Haze requirements, and updates are required every five years. A new CAVR was issued in January 2017 which requires states to implement new air pollution controls implementation plans in 2021 and 2022. NOx emissions contribute to ground level ozone which can contribute to localized haze, and many State Implementation Plans are addressing NOx reduction as part of CAVR compliance. The overall obligation of CAVR is to return the U.S. scenic areas to “active” visibility by 2064.
New Unit Permits:  New gas fired units for both electricity generation and industrial use will require Best Available Control Technology (BACT) as a permit requirement. SCR technology is very often BACT for NOx, and these permit requirements generate new market opportunities.
Consent Decrees: Consent decree activity through the U.S. Department of Justice or EPA may require emission sources to meet individual requirements. Sources may also agree to specific air pollution requirements with states or environmental groups.
Regulations and Markets: International
 
We also sell air pollution control systems outside the U.S., specifically in Europe, Latin America, India (under a license agreement) and in the Pacific Rim. The demand for our technologies comes from specific governmental regulations in NOx and particulate matter emission limits which vary by country. We expect that there will be further opportunities to implement our technologies globally in established as well as new geographies in 2023.
 
The European Union published the Best Available Reference Technology (BREF) emission guidelines in mid 2017 which continue to be implemented gradually starting from large utility boilers and down to industrial units. The 2017 BREF guidelines reduced NOx limit values by up to 25% which required an upgrade of the first-generation NOx abatement systems, and that has presented new opportunities for Fuel Tech, especially on biomass and waste incineration plants. The projects were slow to implement due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic related restrictions and lock downs, however, the pace of implementation picked up in 2022 and that is expected to continue in 2023. New system opportunities are also being identified and followed in chemical production and petrochemical industries. European engineering companies are supplying power generation and flue gas treatment systems to industrial and utility customers globally. Fuel Tech’s NOx control technologies can be integrated into these systems.
 
In South Africa, the state-owned utility Eskom is slowly refurbishing aging ESPs and adding FGC technology to further improve ESP performance. Fuel Tech is well placed to compete for this business with our local partner Lesedi.
 
The Indian government adopted a less stringent NOx emission standard for legacy power plants than what was initially agreed to in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement. As a result, SNCR systems will be limited to waste-to-energy and industrial units for the foreseeable future. The government has prioritized sulfur oxide abatement over NOx abatement for the near term. Particulate matter emission reductions continue to be an area of focus in the country and that presents an ongoing opportunity for Fuel Tech’s FGC technology application which utilizes sulfur trioxide and ammonia injection. These technologies will be implemented through a collaboration with our local partner ISGEC.
 
Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, particulate emissions due to poor performing ESPs are being mitigated. Power generators in several countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines are actively looking for corrective options. In Taiwan, there is a push to convert coal fired units to burn biomass. This presents Fuel Tech with opportunities to bring our ASNCR, SCR, Ultra and FGC technologies to these markets.

Products
 
Our NOx reduction and particulate control technologies are installed worldwide on over 1,200 combustion units, including utility, industrial and municipal solid waste applications.  Our products include customized NOx control systems and our patented ULTRA® technology, which converts urea-to-ammonia on site and provides safe reagent for use in SCR systems.
 

● | SCR Systems and Services: Our SCR systems control NOx emissions from industrial and utility sources including boilers, incinerators, kilns, reformers and many other types of heat recovery equipment firing coal, natural gas, oil, and a variety of process gases and waste fuels. The SCR systems typically include urea or ammonia storage and delivery subsystems, reagent injection systems in the form of an Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG), catalyst reactor vessel and SCR catalyst. In addition, other related services, including start-ups, maintenance support and general consulting services for SCR systems, AIG design and tuning to help optimize catalyst performance, and catalyst management services to help optimize catalyst life, are now offered to customers around the world. We also specialize in CFD models, which simulate fluid flow by generating a virtual replication of real-world geometry and operating inputs. We design flow corrective devices, such as turning vanes, ash screens, static mixers and our patented GSG™ Graduated Straightening Grid. Our SCR systems utilize urea or ammonia as the SCR catalyst reagent to achieve NOx reductions of up to 85% from industrial combustion sources.

● | ULTRA® Technology: Our ULTRA® process is designed to convert urea to ammonia safely and economically for use as a reagent in the SCR process for NOx reduction. Recent local objections in the ammonia permitting process have raised concerns regarding the safety of ammonia shipment and storage in quantities sufficient to supply SCR. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has characterized anhydrous ammonia as a Toxic Inhalation Hazard commodity. The safe conversion of urea to ammonia just prior to injection into the flue gas duct is particularly important near densely populated cities, major waterways, harbors or islands, or where the storage or transport of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia is a safety concern. UDI™ Urea Direct Injection systems utilize direct injection of urea reagent without the need for an ammonia injection grid.

● | SNCR Systems: Our NOxOUT® and HERT™ SNCR processes use urea or ammonia reagent injected into a variety of combustion furnaces to reduce NOx by up to 25% - 50% for utilities and by potentially significantly greater amounts for industrial units. Capital costs ranging from $5 - $20/kW for utility boilers and with total annualized operating costs range from $1,000 - $2,000/ton of NOx removed. Advanced SNCR systems are also available to improve performance and minimize reagent costs through in-furnace monitoring and an advanced control system. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | I-NOx® Systems: Our I-NOx® systems can include burner modifications and SNCR components combined with SCR technology. Together, these systems provide up to 90% NOx reduction at significantly lower capital and operating costs than conventional SCR systems while providing greater operational flexibility to plant operators. The capital costs for I-NOx® systems can range from $30 - $150/kW depending on boiler size and configuration, which is significantly less than that of conventional SCRs, which can cost $300/kW or more, while operating costs are competitive with those experienced by conventional SCR systems.

APC Competition
 
Competition with our NOx reduction suite of products may be expected from companies supplying SCR Systems, SNCR systems, ESP retrofits and FGC technologies. In addition, we experience competition in the urea-to-ammonia conversion market.
 
The SCR process is an effective and proven method of control for removal of NOx up to 90%. SCR systems have a high capital cost of $300+/kW on retrofit coal applications. Companies including GE, Babcock Power, Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) Company, CECO Environmental and Mitsubishi are active SCR system and reagent feed system providers.
 
The use of both urea and ammonia as the reagent for the SNCR process can reduce NOx by 30% - 70%, depending on a number of factors. Ammonia can be effective on incinerators and on Circulating Fluidized Bed combustion units, but has limited applicability for most utility boilers, where urea is dominant. The ammonia-based systems utilize either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia, both of which are hazardous substances. Competitors for ammonia based SNCR include CECO Environmental, B&W, and Yara, with CECO Environmental and B&W for urea based SNCR systems.
 
ESP retrofit competitors include B&W and Southern Environmental. FGC competition includes Wahlco, Inc. and Chemithon, Inc.
 
Lastly, with respect to urea-to-ammonia conversion technologies, our controlled urea decomposition system competes with Hamon and Wahlco, which manufacture a system that hydrolyzes urea under high temperature and pressure.
 
APC Backlog
 
Consolidated APC segment backlog at December 31, 2022 was $8.2 million versus backlog at December 31, 2021 of $9.1 million. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $7.9 million of the backlog over the next 12 months with the remaining recognized thereafter.
 
FUEL CHEM
 
Product and Markets
 
The FUEL CHEM® technology segment revolves around the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the efficiency, reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility, industrial, pulp and paper, waste-to-energy, university and district heating markets.  FUEL CHEM programs are currently in place on combustion units in North America, Mexico and Europe, treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels, including coal, heavy oil, black liquor, biomass and municipal waste.
 
Central to the FUEL CHEM approach is the introduction of chemical reagents, such as magnesium hydroxide, to combustion units via in-body fuel application (pre-combustion) or via direct injection (post-combustion) utilizing our proprietary TIFI® technology.  By attacking performance-hindering problems, such as slagging, fouling and corrosion, as well as the formation of sulfur trioxide (SO3), and ammonium bisulfate, our programs offer numerous operational, financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers, furnaces and other combustion units.
 
A key market factor for this product line is the continued use of coal for global electricity production. In 2022, coal accounted for approximately 20% of all U.S. electricity generation and roughly 39% of global electricity generation. The global value is up from 37% in 2021, however 2022 was unique relative to higher natural gas pricing and future increases in coal usage are not expected to be the long-term trend. Major coal consumers include the U.S., China and India. Additional market dynamics include a growing, worldwide utilization of biomass for both steam and electrical production, and the continued use of heavy fuel oil for power generation. The principal markets for this product line are electric power plants burning coals with slag-forming constituents such as sodium, iron and high levels of sulfur. Sodium is typically found in the Powder River Basin coals of Wyoming and Montana. Iron is typically found in coals produced in the Illinois Basin region. High sulfur content is typical of Illinois Basin coals and certain Appalachian coals. High sulfur content can give rise to unacceptable levels of SO3 formation especially in plants with SCR systems and flue gas desulphurization units (scrubbers).  As coal units strive to compete in electricity supply markets, lower cost, higher slagging fuels can create more operational challenges which TIFI® Programs can help mitigate. The current Mexican government is utilizing more indigenous fuel sources for power generation because the international market for high sulfur fuel oil (what Mexico produces) has been significantly reduced with the adoption of the new International Maritime Organization restrictions. Fuel Tech’s TIFI® systems can help with SO3 mitigation at these oil-fired power generation units.
 
The combination of slagging coals and SO3-related issues, such as “blue plume” formation, air pre-heater fouling and corrosion, SCR fouling and the proclivity to suppress certain mercury removal processes, represents an attractive market potential for Fuel Tech.
 
Sales of the FUEL CHEM products were $16.3 million and $17.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Competition
 
Competition for our FUEL CHEM product line includes chemicals sold by specialty chemical companies, such as Imerys, Environmental Energy Services, Inc., and SUEZ Water Technologies. No technologically comparable substantive competition currently exists for our TIFI® technology, which is designed primarily for slag control and SO3 abatement, but there can be no assurance that such lack of substantive competition will continue.

These patents and applications cover some 31 inventions, 14 associated with our NOx reduction business, 12 associated with the FUEL CHEM business, and five associated with water treatment. Our granted patents have expiration dates ranging from March of 2024 to October of 2040.
 
Management believes that the protection provided by the numerous claims in the above referenced patents or patent applications is substantial and affords us a significant competitive advantage in our business. Accordingly, any significant reduction in the protection afforded by these patents or any significant development in competing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
At December 31, 2022, we had 66 employees, 61 in North America and five in Europe. We enjoy good relations with our employees and are not a party to any labor management agreement.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
We manage our Company according to a set of core principles. Included among these are respect for the individual, aspiring to excellence, safety and security, and appropriate reward for outstanding effort. We have put in place an employee compensation plan that recognizes hard work with above average salaries and equity incentive awards.
