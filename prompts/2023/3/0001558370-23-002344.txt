Item 1. Business
Fortitude Gold Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August 11, 2020. On August 18, 2020, Gold Resource Corporation (“GRC”) transferred all of the issued and outstanding shares of GRC Nevada (“GRCN”) to us. GRCN owns all of GRC’s former Nevada properties, including the Isabella Pearl Mine. On December 31, 2020 GRC completed the spin-off of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortitude Gold Corporation, and its subsidiaries (“FGC”), into a separate, public company (the “Spin-Off”). The Spin-Off was effected by the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of FGC common stock to GRC’s shareholders. In this report, “Company,” “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Fortitude Gold Corporation together with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
We are a mining company which pursues gold and silver projects that are expected to have both low operating costs and high returns on capital. We are presently focused on mineral production from our Isabella Pearl Mine in Nevada. The ore mined at Isabella Pearl is processed on site at our processing facilities and sold to a refiner as doré, which contains precious metals of gold and silver. We also continue exploration and evaluation work on our portfolio of other precious metal properties in Nevada and continue to evaluate other properties for possible acquisition.
Effective December 31, 2020, in connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement (“MSA” or “Agreement”) with GRC that governed the relationship of the parties following the Spin-Off. The MSA provided that the Company received services from GRC and its subsidiaries to assist in the transition of the Company as a separate company including, managerial and technical supervision, advisory and consultation with respect to mining operations, exploration, environmental, safety and sustainability matters. The Company also received certain administrative services related to information technology, accounting and financial advisory services, legal and compliance support and investor relation and shareholder communication services. The agreed upon charges for services rendered were based on market rates that align with the rates that an unaffiliated service provider would charge for similar services. The MSA’s initial term was to expire on December 31, 2021, would automatically renew annually and may be cancelled upon 30 days written notice by one party to the other during the term. On April 21, 2021, GRC provided the Company 30 days written notice to cancel the MSA effective May 21, 2021.
We own 100% of six properties in Nevada, totaling 1,806 unpatented lode and placer mineral claims, and mill site claims covering approximately 32,744 acres, subject to the paramount title of the United States of America, under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). Under the Mining Law of 1872, which governs the location of unpatented claims on federal lands, the owner (locator) has the right to explore, develop, and mine minerals on unpatented claims without payments of production royalties to the U.S. government, subject to the surface management regulations of the BLM. Currently, annual claim maintenance fees are the only federal payments related to unpatented claims. Annual claim maintenance fees of $320,391 were paid during 2022.
In addition to the unpatented claims, we also own 21, and lease one, patented mining claims covering approximately 165 acres and an additional 201 acres of fee lands in Mineral County, Nevada. Patented claims and fee lands unlike unpatented claims, pass title to the holder. The patented claims and fee lands are subject to payment of annual property taxes made to the county where they are located. Annual property taxes on our patented claims and fee lands have been paid through June 30, 2023.
All our properties are located in Nevada, five are located in the Walker Lane Mineral Belt which is known for its significant and high-grade gold and silver production and one in west-central Nevada. Activities at our properties in Nevada range from exploration at East Camp Douglas and Ripper, mineral delineation at Mina Gold, resource definition, engineering and permitting at County Line and Golden Mile, to production at Isabella Pearl. We believe that our Nevada properties have excellent potential for additional discoveries of both bulk tonnage replacement-type and bonanza-grade vein-type gold deposits, similar to other gold deposits historically mined by other companies in the Paradise Peak, Borealis, Bodie, Tonopah, Goldfield, and Rochester districts.

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. We maintain insurance policies against property loss of our Isabella Pearl process facility. Insuring additional facilities, including the open pit and the heap leach pad, from natural occurrences like earthquakes are currently cost prohibitive. Such insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability, and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event.
Environmental Matters
We conduct our operations while protecting the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that we believe meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2022, $5.9 million was accrued on our consolidated balance sheet for reclamation costs relating to our properties.
Competitive Business Conditions
The acquisition of gold and silver properties is subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. We may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, advancement of mining properties. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects and retaining experienced mining professionals will continue to be intense in the future.
Government Regulations and Permits
In the U.S., an unpatented mining claim on unappropriated federal land may be acquired pursuant to procedures established by the Mining Law of 1872 and other federal and state laws. These acts generally provide that a citizen of the U.S. (including a corporation) may acquire a possessory right to develop and mine valuable mineral deposits discovered upon appropriate federal lands, provided that such lands have not been withdrawn from mineral location, e.g., national parks, military reservations and lands designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The validity of all unpatented mining claims is dependent upon inherent uncertainties and conditions. These uncertainties relate to such non-record facts as the sufficiency of the discovery of minerals, proper posting and marking of boundaries, and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record. Prior to discovery of a locatable mineral on an unpatented mining claim, a mining claim may be open to location by others unless the owner is in possession of the claim.
To maintain an unpatented mining claims in good standing, the claim owner must file with the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) an annual maintenance fee ($165 for each claim, which may change year to year), a maintenance fee waiver certification, or proof of labor or affidavit of assessment work, all in accordance with the laws at the time of filing which may periodically change.
In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The departments responsible for the environmental regulation include the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP), the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and the Nevada Department of Wildlife (“NDOW”). Any of these and other regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with their environmental and operational regulations or standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, including ours, include but are not limited to, acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust, and noise.
We have obtained the permits necessary to develop, construct, and operate our Isabella Pearl Mine. In connection with these permits and exploration activities in Nevada, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment, including, but not limited to, the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive.
Customers
For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, one customer accounted for 97% and 96%, respectively, of our revenue from our Isabella Pearl mine. In the event that our relationship with this customer is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our products. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.
Human Capital Resources
We have 60 full-time employees, four of which serve as our executive officers. These individuals devote all of their business time to our affairs.
We contract for the services of approximately 35 individuals employed by third parties in Nevada and also use various independent contractors for environmental permitting, mining, surface exploration drilling and trucking.
We believe we have a good morale and a dedicated workforce. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our Equity Incentive Plan are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. Competition to identify, hire and retain employees from the small pool of industry experienced professionals is and will continue to be a challenge.
Office Facilities
Our executive and administrative headquarters are located at 2886 Carriage Manor Point, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80906 under a renewable one-year lease at a cost of $5,000 per month.
