Item 1. Business
General
We are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products. Our operations are currently comprised of four segments: Aerospace & Electronics (“A&E”), Process Flow Technologies (“PFT”), Payment & Merchandising Technologies (“P&MT”), and Engineered Materials (“EM”). Our primary end markets include aerospace, defense and space, process industries, non-residential and municipal construction, payment automation solutions, banknote design and production, along with a wide range of general industrial and certain consumer related end markets.
We have been committed to the highest standards of business conduct since inception in 1855 when our founder, R.T. Crane, resolved “to conduct my business in the strictest honesty and fairness; to avoid all deception and trickery; to deal fairly with both customers and competitors; to be liberal and just toward employees; and to put my whole mind upon the business.”
Our strategy is to grow earnings and cash flow by focusing on the manufacturing of highly engineered industrial products for specific markets where our scale is a relative advantage, and where we can compete based on our proprietary and differentiated technology, our deep vertical expertise, and our responsiveness to unique and diverse customer needs. We continuously evaluate our portfolio, pursue acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and selectively divest businesses where appropriate. We strive to foster a performance-based culture focused on productivity and continuous improvement, to attract and retain a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of our shareholders, and to maintain a focused, efficient corporate structure.
We operate a comprehensive set of business processes, philosophies and operational excellence tools to drive continuous improvement throughout our businesses (collectively, the Crane Business System). Beginning with a core value of integrity, we incorporate “Voice of the Customer” teachings (specific processes designed to capture our customers’ requirements) and a broad range of tools into a disciplined strategy deployment process to continuously improve safety, quality, delivery, cost and growth. An embedded intellectual capital development process helps ensure that we attract, develop, promote and retain talent to drive continuity and repeatable results.
Recent Transactions
Holding Company Reorganization
On May 16, 2022, Crane Co., a Delaware corporation (“Crane Co.”), completed its previously announced reorganization merger pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022 (the “Reorganization Agreement”), by and among Crane Co., Crane Holdings, Co., a Delaware corporation (“Crane Holdings”), and Crane Transaction Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and, as of immediately prior to the consummation of such merger, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Holdings (“Merger Sub”). The Reorganization Agreement provided for the merger of Crane Co. and Merger Sub, with Crane Co. surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Holdings (the “Reorganization Merger”).
Following the Reorganization Merger, on May 16, 2022, Crane Co. converted from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company named “Crane LLC” (such conversion, together with the Reorganization Merger, the “Reorganization”). Following the Reorganization, substantially all of the assets of Crane LLC were distributed, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to, and certain non-asbestos related liabilities of Crane LLC were assumed by, Crane Holdings. On May 17, 2022, Crane LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation named “Crane Co.” Subsequently, on May 26, 2022, Crane Co. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective upon filing, pursuant to which the Crane Co. officially changed its name from “Crane Co.” to “Redco Corporation”. The “Crane Co.” name has been reserved for future use by Crane Holdings.
Divestiture of asbestos-related assets and liabilities 
On August 12, 2022, Crane Holdings, Co., Crane Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Holdings, Co., and Redco Corporation (“Redco”), then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Company that held asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Redco Purchase Agreement”) with Spruce Lake Liability Management Holdco LLC (“Redco Buyer”), an unrelated third party and long-term liability management company specializing in the acquisition and management of legacy corporate liabilities whereby Crane Company transferred to Redco Buyer all of the issued and outstanding shares of Redco (the “Redco Sale”). In connection with the Redco Sale, Crane Holdings, Co., on behalf of Crane Company, contributed approximately $550 million in cash to Redco, which was funded by a combination of short-
term borrowings and cash on hand. As a result of the Redco Sale, all asbestos obligations and liabilities, related insurance assets and associated deferred tax assets have been removed from Crane Holdings, Co.’s consolidated balance sheets effective August 12, 2022. A loss on the divestiture of asbestos-related assets and liabilities of $162.4 million was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole
Competitive Conditions
Our businesses participate in markets that are highly competitive. Because of the diversity of products manufactured and sold, our businesses typically have a different set of competitors in each geographic area and end market in which they participate. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the number of competitors, or precise market share; however, we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our markets. Our primary basis of competition is providing high quality products, with technological differentiation, at competitive prices, with superior customer service and timely delivery.
Our products are sold into primary end markets which include aerospace, defense and space, process industries, non-residential and municipal construction, payment automation solutions, banknote design and production, along with a wide range of general industrial and certain consumer related end markets. As such, our revenues depend on numerous unpredictable factors, including changes in market demand, general economic conditions, customer capital spending, timing and amount of contract awards and credit availability. Since our products are sold in such a wide variety of markets, we do not believe that we can reliably quantify or predict the potential effects of changes in any of the aforementioned factors. Our engineering and product development activities are focused on improving existing products, customizing existing products for particular customer requirements, as well as the development of new products. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property, no one of which is of such importance that termination would materially affect our business. From time to time, however, we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property.
Raw Materials
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics, cotton, flax and various petroleum-based products. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. Although market forces have at times, including in 2022, caused increases in the costs of key raw materials, there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business. We believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at acceptable costs. For a further discussion of risks related to raw materials, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Government Contracts
We have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in our Aerospace & Electronics and Payment & Merchandising Technologies segments and, to a lesser extent, our Process Flow Technologies segment. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts. For example, some government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Environmental Compliance and Climate Change
We are regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce significant volumes or quantities of byproducts that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment if not properly handled or maintained. Accordingly, continued compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures or earnings. 
However, we occasionally engage in environmental remediation activities as required by federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in the characterization and remediation of federal Superfund sites, or analogous state sites. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. For further discussion of environmental related risks, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” For further discussion of our environmental matters, please refer to Part II, Item 8 under Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Human Capital Resources
To remain a leading manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products, it is important that we continue to attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent across our global enterprise. 
The Company has a diverse global workforce located in 34 countries, spanning six continents. At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 11,000 persons worldwide, of which substantially all were full time employees. In the United States, we employed approximately 5,900 people across 100 locations. At December 31, 2022, approximately 4% of our U.S. employees were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. Employees based in some foreign countries may, from time to time, be represented by works councils or unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our associates. We are committed to developing our associates personally and professionally by leveraging a structured and disciplined Intellectual Capital (“IC”) process. Our regular IC cadence includes constructive reviews and various talent and leadership development initiatives conducted by the executive management team and provided throughout an associate’s career. We are also committed to an inclusive and high-performance culture at all levels of the organization, based on trust and respect.
The manufacture and production of our products requires the use of a variety of tools, equipment, materials, and supplies. At Crane, we are strongly committed to the health and safety of our associates and strive to continuously adhere to global regulatory safety requirements and to reduce the incidence and severity of job-related injuries. We utilize strict compliance protocols, training programs, effective risk management practices, and sound science in our operations to minimize risk to our associates. 
Beginning in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented flexible remote work options and health and safety protocols and procedures across all of our global offices, manufacturing and distribution facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates. These protocols included proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use and temperature screenings and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S., and other similar public health authorities in our international locations. Today, we continue to deploy various work options and protocols in response to the significantly reduced health risks compared to the initial and early period of the pandemic.
For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
