Item 1. Business
This annual report on Form 10-K is a combined report being filed by two separate Registrants, American States Water Company (“AWR”) and Golden State Water Company (“GSWC”). References in this report to “Registrant” are to AWR and GSWC, collectively, unless otherwise specified. GSWC makes no representations as to the information contained in this report relating to AWR and its subsidiaries, other than GSWC.
AWR makes its periodic reports, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and current reports, Form 8-K, available free of charge through its website, www.aswater.com, as soon as material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such reports are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. AWR also makes available free of charge its code of business conduct and ethics, its corporate governance guidelines and the charters of its Nominating and Governance Committee, Compensation Committee and Audit and Finance Committee through its website or by calling (877) 463-6297. AWR and GSWC have filed the certification of officers required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Form 10-K for fiscal 2022.
Overview
AWR is the parent company of GSWC, Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. (“BVESI”) and American States Utility Services, Inc. (“ASUS”) (and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Fort Bliss Water Services Company (“FBWS”), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. (“TUS”), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. (“ODUS”), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. (“PSUS”), Old North Utility Services, Inc. (“ONUS”), Emerald Coast Utility Services, Inc. (“ECUS”) and Fort Riley Utility Services, Inc. (“FRUS”)). On July 1, 2020, GSWC completed the transfer of the electric utility assets and liabilities from its electric division to BVESI, in exchange for common shares of BVESI. GSWC then immediately distributed all of BVESI’s common shares to AWR, whereupon BVESI became wholly owned directly by AWR. This reorganization did not result in any substantive changes to AWR’s operations and business segments.
AWR has three reportable segments: water, electric and contracted services. Within the segments, AWR has three principal business units, water and electric service utility operations conducted through its regulated utilities GSWC and BVESI, respectively, and contracted services conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries. FBWS, TUS, ODUS, PSUS, ONUS, ECUS and FRUS may be referred to herein collectively as the “Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.”
GSWC is a public water utility engaged in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water in 10 counties in the state of California.  GSWC is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”).  BVESI is a public electric utility that distributes electricity in several San Bernardino County mountain communities in California, and is also regulated by the CPUC. Additional information regarding public utility regulation is discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition" and Results of Operations” under the section titled “Regulatory Matters.” 
AWR’s regulated utilities served 263,265 water customers and 24,705 electric customers at December 31, 2022, or a total of 287,970 customers, compared with 262,770 water customers and 24,656 electric customers at December 31, 2021, or a total of 287,426 customers. Both GSWC’s and BVESI’s operations exhibit seasonal trends. Although both have diversified customer bases, residential and commercial customers account for the majority of water and electric sales and revenues. Revenues derived from commercial and residential customers accounted for approximately 90% of total water and electric revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
ASUS, through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, has contracted with the U.S. government to provide water and/or wastewater services at various military installations. ASUS operates, maintains and performs construction activities (including renewal and replacement capital work) on water and/or wastewater systems at various U.S. military bases pursuant to an initial 50-year firm, fixed price contract and additional firm, fixed-price contracts.  Each of the contracts with the U.S. government is subject to termination, in whole or in part, prior to the end of its 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the ASUS subsidiary performing the contract. The price for each of these contracts is subject to annual economic price adjustments. Contracts are also subject to modifications for changes in circumstances, changes in laws and regulations, and additions to the contract value for new construction of facilities at the military bases.  AWR guarantees performance of ASUS’s military privatization contracts.
Pursuant to the terms of the 50-year contract with the U.S. government, the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate the following water and wastewater systems:

Subsidiary | Military Base | Type of System | Location 
FBWS | Fort Bliss | Water and Wastewater | Texas and New Mexico
TUS | Joint Base Andrews | Water and Wastewater | Maryland 
ODUS | Fort Lee | Wastewater | Virginia 
ODUS | Joint-Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story | Water and Wastewater | Virginia 
PSUS | Fort Jackson | Water and Wastewater | South Carolina 
ONUS | Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield and Camp Mackall | Water and Wastewater | North Carolina 
ECUS | Eglin Air Force Base | Water and Wastewater | Florida 
FRUS | Fort Riley | Water and Wastewater Collection and Treatment | Kansas 

Certain financial information for each of AWR’s business segments - water distribution, electric distribution, and contracted services - is set forth in Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of American States Water Company and its subsidiaries. While AWR’s water and electric utility segments are not dependent upon a single or only a few customers, the U.S. government is the primary customer for ASUS’s contracted services.  ASUS, from time to time, performs work at military bases for other prime contractors of the U.S. government. 
Seasonality
The demand for water and electricity varies by season. For instance, there can be a higher level of water consumption during the third quarter of each year when weather in California tends to be hot and dry. During unusually wet weather, our customers generally use less water. The CPUC has adopted regulatory mechanisms at GSWC that help mitigate fluctuations in revenues due to changes in water consumption by our customers in California, which currently remain in effect.
The demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snow levels. An increase in winter snow levels reduces the use of snow making machines at ski resorts in the Big Bear area and, as a result, reduces our electric revenues. Likewise, unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snow making conditions, which also reduces our electric revenues. The CPUC has adopted regulatory mechanisms for our electric business, which helps mitigate fluctuations in the revenues of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by BVESI’s customers.
Environmental Regulations
AWR’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive environmental regulations. GSWC is required to comply with safe drinking water requirements, including testing to determine constituents in its water supply and customer notification requirements if certain contaminants exceed maximum levels or advisory levels, and requirements to address issues relating to known contamination. The subsidiaries of ASUS are subject to similar requirements in connection with their water and wastewater operations on military bases. GSWC is also responsible for clean-up and remediation at a plant site that contained an underground storage tank. As mandated by legislation enacted in California, BVESI is required to submit wildfire mitigation plans to the CPUC for approval. California requires all electric utilities to prepare plans on constructing, maintaining, and operating their electrical lines and equipment to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire. 
ASUS’s subsidiaries are responsible for ensuring compliance with the reduction and/or removal of all constituents required under its wastewater treatment plant operating permits. ASUS works closely with state regulators and industry associations to stay current with emergent issues and proactively addresses any change in wastewater treatment regulation to ensure permit compliance.
The regulated utilities spent approximately $21.7 million in 2022 and expect to spend approximately $24.3 million in 2023 for capital expenditures on environmental control facilities. During 2022, ASUS performed construction activities (for the benefit of the U.S. government) related to environmental control facilities with a contract value of $922,000. ASUS expects to perform construction activities related to environmental control facilities with a contract value of $1.7 million in 2023. In addition, various other capital expenditures at the regulated utilities and construction projects at ASUS are incurred for purposes other than environmental control facilities, but may also have some environmental benefits. An environmental control facility is any facility that is reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement, control of monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, solid waste, thermal pollution, radiation or other pollutants.
Environmental matters and compliance with such laws and regulations are discussed further in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the section titled “Environmental Matters.”
Climate Change Planning, Risks and Opportunities
Climate change is one area that we focus on as we develop and execute our business strategy and financial planning, both in the short- and long-term and is subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors and senior management. First and foremost, designing and implementing efficient and resilient infrastructure and operational processes not only addresses climate change, but also reduces costs. Our capital investment programs are critical to ensure we can continue delivering reliable, high-quality water, wastewater and electric services without interruption. As a utility company, our operating strategy is dependent on having a reliable infrastructure in place.
The risks posed by climate variability increase the need for us to plan for and address supply resiliency. We address these risks by planning, assessing, mitigating, and investing in our infrastructure for the long-term benefit of our communities. As a provider of an essential product and service, our primary goal is to ensure service is uninterrupted. 
GSWC considers the potential impacts of climate change in its water supply portfolio planning and its overall infrastructure replacement plans. We evaluate how water supplies, water quality and water demands may change, and consider mitigation strategies to assist us in being able to deliver water to our customers.
We seek to minimize our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to assist in reducing the effects of climate change. We studied our GHG emissions levels, set a 2020 baseline, and developed a GHG emissions reduction target of 60% by 2035 from the 2020 baseline. To accomplish this, Registrant has developed a phased approach, which includes short-, medium- and long-term actions. Our priorities include reductions in energy use and increasing purchases of green energy for our water operations, increasing purchases of green energy for distribution to our electric customers, and reviewing our vehicle fleet needs and electrification. Achievement of this reduction target is contingent on certain external factors, which include the ongoing development of technology, and successful achievement by the state of California in reaching its Renewables Portfolio Standard goal for this period. 
Water Utility
There are risks to maintaining adequate water quality and/or supply, either from climate variability or other events. They include droughts, changes in weather patterns, natural disasters, wildfires, decisions or actions restricting the use of water from our sources, and/or pumping of groundwater, and contamination or acts of terrorism or vandalism. We consider these potential events in our strategic planning process as we aim to avoid service interruptions and compromised water quality. 
Our goal is to maintain adequate and high-quality water supplies. We strive to reach this goal in a number of ways, including monitoring water levels, short- and long-term water supply planning, having a diverse water supply portfolio, developing contingency plans, water efficiency and conservation efforts, and maintaining a strong infrastructure. Additional information on GSWC’s water supplies is discussed further in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “Water Supplies.”
Electric Utility
Climate change has also impacted electric utilities in California due to an increase in wildfires. BVESI’s compliance with its wildfire mitigation plans have resulted in an increase in capital expenditures for wildfire mitigation projects. BVESI will not be able to recover the costs incurred to make capital improvements included in BVESI’s current wildfire mitigation plans from customers until the CPUC approves recovery of these costs in its next general rate case filing, which was filed in August 2022 and will determine new electric rates for the years 2023-2026. Power supplies may also become more constrained and more expensive due to regulation of power plants using fossil fuels.
California has established a cap-and-trade program applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. While BVESI’s power-plant emissions are below the reporting threshold, as a “Covered Entity” BVESI has an obligation to file a report with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in June of each year under the Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Regulation. The report will become available publicly in the last quarter of 2023.
The State of California and the CPUC have established renewable energy procurement targets. BVESI has entered into a CPUC-approved ten-year contract for renewable energy credits. Because of this agreement, BVESI believes it will comply through at least 2023 with California’s renewable energy statutes that address this issue. BVESI is pursuing short- and long-term renewable energy contracts to satisfy its requirements related to its resource portfolio for compliance period 4 (2021-2024) and beyond.
In 2022, BVESI’s renewable power represented 38.5% of total electric supply purchases. Renewable Energy Procurement requirements continue to escalate, reaching 50% by 2026 and 100% carbon free by 2045. BVESI has issued a proposal to construct a solar energy project in Big Bear Lake, subject to obtaining CPUC approval and necessary permits. If approved and constructed, the project will provide a clean, local energy solution for the service territory. 
BVESI offers a Distributed Generation Program, which benefits customers who install a solar or wind-generating facility that produces renewable energy. Those customers can receive a bill credit if their monthly renewable energy production 
exceeds their on-site use. BVESI also has a number of customers on its Net Energy Metering Program (NEM), which was the previous renewable energy program. NEM customers can receive a bill credit if their annual renewable energy production exceeds their on-site use. Approximately 5% of the energy consumed by our BVESI customers is now generated by customer-owned renewable sources (solar).
BVESI is also required to comply with the CPUC’s greenhouse gas emission performance standards. Under these standards, BVESI must file an annual attestation with the CPUC stating that BVESI has no new ownership investment in generation facilities exceeding the emission performance standards and no long-term commitments for generation exceeding the standards. In January 2023, BVESI filed an attestation that BVESI complied with the standards for 2022. At this time, management cannot estimate the impact, if any, that these regulations may have on future costs over BVESI’s power plant operations or the cost of BVESI’s purchased power from third party providers.
COVID-19
GSWC, BVESI and ASUS have continued their operations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic given that their water, wastewater and electric utility services are deemed essential. AWR’s responses take into account orders issued by the CPUC, and continued monitoring of guidance provided by federal, state, and local health authorities and other government officials for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Some of the actions taken by GSWC and BVESI included suspending service disconnections for nonpayment pursuant to CPUC and state orders, and telecommuting by employees. The suspension of water-service disconnections at GSWC were implemented in response to an executive order from the governor of California, as well as CPUC orders. Pursuant to a CPUC July 2021 decision, the moratorium on water-service disconnections due to non-payment of past-due amounts billed to residential customers expired on February 1, 2022. However, water service cannot be disconnected so long as customers make timely payments on current bills, and are provided and adhere to payment plans to pay down past-due bills resulting from the pandemic. The moratorium on electric customer service disconnections ended on September 30, 2021. However, electric-service disconnections for non-payment can only be done after taking into account other matters, such as average daily temperatures under certain conditions, and residential disconnections are capped on an annual basis at 2.5% of the total residential customers during the previous calendar year. With the CPUC’s moratoriums on service disconnections for nonpayment for water and electric customers ending, service disconnections due to nonpayment have resumed with disconnections for delinquent residential customers resuming in June 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering effects to the economy contributed to significant volatility in financial markets throughout the pandemic. The continued economic impact could adversely impact the value of GSWC’s pension and other retirement plan assets due to possible declines in security prices.
In addition, the lingering effects of the pandemic has placed a strain on supply chains to sufficiently meet demand of materials and supplies necessary to complete some capital expenditure projects at our regulated utilities, as well as some construction projects at our contracted services segment. While we may purchase materials and supplies upfront when appropriate, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent delays or disruptions to our capital investments or construction projects. Furthermore, Registrant has experienced increased costs due to the impacts of inflation. The regulated utilities may update their costs as part of general rate case proceedings or advice letter filings, as related to COVID-19 emergency costs. ASUS may update prices annually through economic price adjustments. However, until we receive increased funding to offset higher costs, our liquidity may be negatively impacted.
Additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on GSWC and BVESI is provided in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled COVID-19.
Competition
The businesses of GSWC and BVESI are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories.  However, GSWC and BVESI may be subject to eminent domain proceedings in which governmental agencies, under state law, may acquire GSWC’s water systems or BVESI’s electric system if doing so is necessary and in the public’s interest. GSWC competes with governmental agencies and other investor-owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms, availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis. ASUS actively competes for business with other investor-owned utilities, other third-party providers of water and/or wastewater services, and governmental entities primarily on the basis of quality of service and price.
AWR Workforce
AWR and its subsidiaries had a total of 811 employees as of December 31, 2022.  GSWC had 501 employees as of December 31, 2022. BVESI had 46 employees, of which 17 employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which expires in December 2025. All of the employees of GSWC and BVESI are located in California. At times, GSWC and BVESI use temporary and contract workers for a finite period of time and in a limited capacity to continue a project or workflow until they can hire a regular employee. It is also common for those temporary workers to be hired on as a regular, full-time employee.
ASUS and its subsidiaries had a total of 264 employees as of December 31, 2022. Fifteen of FBWS’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers. This agreement expires in September 2023.
Our businesses requires a combination of complex infrastructure, regulatory expertise and customer service. Ongoing development of our talent across the organization to meet critical business needs is a continual focus, and includes (i) building a culture such that high-potential talent is identified and further developed, (ii) creating career paths that not only move up a specialized ladder, but across the organization, and (iii) offering opportunities for employees to accept new challenges through stretch assignments.
Attracting Diverse Candidates 
We understand that strength comes from having a diverse employee population. We strive to hire from our local communities and have a workforce that is representative, at all job levels, of the communities we serve. This begins with the recruitment process. We strive to have all aspects of employment, including the decision to hire, promote, discipline, or discharge, be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. It is our policy not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local laws.
Compensation and Benefits
We pay employees a competitive and fair wage, as benchmarked with other leading companies and the market. Consistent with our principle of valuing personal mastery, we reward employees for improving their skills and capabilities. Our benefits include a defined benefit pension plan for employees hired prior to January 1, 2011, a defined contribution plan for hires or rehires after December 31, 2010, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts. 
Safety and Training
Strong Occupational Health and Safety practices reduce injuries, keep our workforce healthy, and reduce operating costs. A safe workforce translates into better performance company-wide. We work to create a safety-focused culture in which each individual feels personally responsible for their own safety, the safety of their co-workers, as well as the safety of the communities they serve. Safety performance is included as a metric in the officer and manager compensation programs. Employees attend training in various mandated safety programs that are applicable to their operations. In addition, there are regulatory safety training requirements as well as training requirements for the Department of Transportation and training requirements for compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws.
To reinforce our safety efforts and protocols, company-wide safety inspections at GSWC and BVESI are conducted with supervisors. The inspection reports are forwarded to management for review, allocation of resources are made (if needed), and corrective actions are taken. ASUS has a dedicated Safety Coordinator located at each military base installation served. The onsite Safety Coordinator is responsible for regulatory compliance, as well as beneficial health and safety monitoring functions. 
Learning and Development
Compliance training is required each year, for each employee. Other types of training are offered on an optional basis. Examples of optional programs include ongoing water operations competencies and education, supervisor development, knowledge capture and management, feedback and measurements to show the value of learning solutions, and administrative oversight for various business competencies relative to mandated training and compliance requirements. We pay for approved external business-related seminars and workshops. Certain positions require employees to maintain all of their job-specific certifications, licenses and continuing education credits.
On a regular and ongoing basis, we require all employees to certify that they have reviewed and understand our Code of Conduct as well as our Employee Handbook. We provide harassment and prevention awareness training for all employees.
Succession Planning 
On an annual basis, our senior management team completes a roadmap for improving human capital management by developing succession plans with the goal of achieving the most efficient alignment of resources and talent to meet business needs. This includes identifying key succession positions and potential successors for top-level positions, such as Vice Presidents, for the next ten years.
Recruiting, developing and retaining the right talent is key to our long-term success. With 30% of our employees eligible for retirement in the next five years, we are focused on transferring institutional knowledge, continue succession planning and pursue recruitment and development strategies to attract qualified talent. 
Cybersecurity
Cyberattacks represent an increasing threat to water, wastewater and electric utility systems and thereby the safety and security of our communities.  There have also been increasing threats to the information that companies maintain that have resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of private customer, employee, director and corporate financial information. 
We have increased our investments in information technology to monitor and address these threats and attempted cyber-attacks, and to improve our posture in addressing security vulnerabilities. We have adopted multi-layered safeguards and educational measures to protect our operations, assets and digital information. Cybersecurity updates are given to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Quarterly cybersecurity training is required for all employees, with the topics varying each quarter. We also conduct specialized training for employees annually on protecting certain types of information relating to the work we do with the U.S. government. While we have increased our investments in information technology and in employee awareness and education to address security vulnerabilities, there can be no assurance that these measures and our efforts will prevent a cyber-attack.
