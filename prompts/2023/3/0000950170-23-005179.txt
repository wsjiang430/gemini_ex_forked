 Business Segments
 Our Hydraulics segment includes products sold under the Sun Hydraulics, Faster, Custom Fluidpower, Seungwon, NEM, Taimi, Daman and Schultes brands. The Electronics segment includes products sold under the Enovation Controls, Murphy, Zero Off, HCT, Balboa Water Group and Joyonway brands. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
Hydraulics
 There are three key technologies within our Hydraulics segment: cartridge valve technology (“CVT”), quick-release couplings solutions (“QRC”) and hydraulic system solutions (“Systems”), which often incorporate our manifold solutions with CVT and QRC technologies. Our CVT products provide functions important to a hydraulic system: to control rates and direction of fluid flow and to regulate pressures. We pioneered a fundamentally different design platform employing a floating nose construction that results in a self-alignment characteristic. This design provides better performance and reliability advantages compared with most competitors’ product offerings. Our cartridge valves are offered in several size ranges and include both electrically actuated and hydro-mechanical products. They are designed to be able to operate reliably at higher pressures than most competitors, making them equally suitable for both industrial and mobile applications.
Hydraulic systems are increasingly taking signals from on-board electronic control systems, making it necessary for hydraulic products to be capable of digital communication. In response to this we have aggressively expanded our CVT offering of electrically actuated cartridge valves for both the mobile and industrial hydraulics markets and gained significant technology advancements in electro-hydraulic products with the acquisition of NEM.


Recent announcements include the CVT ecoline family, a collection of products focused on increasing the energy efficiency of hydraulic systems. Also, an aggressive segment of new product development that focuses on disruptive technology is yielding results with the recent announcement of the ENERGEN product. ENERGEN is the first hydraulic cartridge valve with the capability to convert hydraulic flow into electrical power. The Sun Common line was introduced in 2022 to offer products better positioned for simpler, lower pressure applications.
 QRC products allow users to connect and disconnect quickly from any hydraulic circuit without leakage and ensure high-performance under high temperature and pressure using one or multiple couplers. Quick connection of multiple hydraulic lines can be accomplished through the use of our casting solution or our signature MultiFaster® product line. In particular, the simultaneous connection of several lines granted by our Multifaster® is an important feature in many applications and allows for dramatic reduction of connection time, even when the system is under pressure, and completely removes the risk of incorrect connections and related hazards for the equipment and the operators. We design, engineer and distribute hydraulic coupling solutions primarily in the agriculture, construction equipment and industrial markets. In 2021, our QRC subsidiary, Faster S.r.l, was selected as a recipient of the John Deere Supplier Innovation Award for 2020, for its multi-connection couplings with integrated valve system. The award was presented to a select group of Suppliers who demonstrated innovation in a product or service they provide to John Deere. Award selections are based on four factors: creativity, feasibility, collaboration and bottom-line impact. In synergy with our Sun Hydraulics LLC business, our engineering teams have combined the advantages and features of MultiFaster® and Sun electro-hydraulic cartridge valves into an integrated manifold, reducing complexity and increasing reliability of the hydraulic circuit as a result. In 2022, Faster won the Systems and Components Trophy – Engineers Choice from DLG for its innovative Faster ABC electronic hydraulic hose coupling. DLG recognizes components or systems with novel or significantly improved concepts that can make a significant contribution to the development and production of agricultural machinery and other off-highway machinery.
 In the past few years we made two strategic acquisitions to expand our addressable markets. The NEM acquisition in June 2021 was important in order to acquire know-how and IP, which grants us access into industrial multi connections, mostly automatically actuated, in fields like steel mills, automotive engine test beds, aeronautics and plastic injection. These multiconnections are typically custom designed for a particular application and handle not just hydraulic, but also various process fluids and electrical signals of low, medium and high voltage.
 The Taimi acquisition is also a bolt-on technology that fits well with our coupling offerings. Taimi developed a hose line accessory with innovative technology granting superior life and performance, not just for the swivel itself but effectively expanding the hose life by up to 10 times in heavy duty applications where hose bending and torsion under severe pressure conditions are normal. This expands market reach into mining, forestry equipment and high-end sailing solutions.
 Many of the current Faster, Taimi, Sun and NEM brand products can be easily combined to form an integrated hydraulic circuit of high technological content.
Systems provide engineered solutions that combine manifolds, CVT and QRC technology and allow users enhanced control of existing equipment. The systems we design and manufacture:
 •may include electro-hydraulic, remote control, electronic control and programmable logic controller systems
 •are highly efficient;
 •increase and optimize productivity;
 •introduce safer operating procedures;



•are smaller in size than competitive products;
 •allow for automation of existing equipment;
 •allow for ease of maintenance; and 
 •reduce energy costs.

 Our culture of continuous improvement and people first approach spans across both segments. Structured programs ensure our supply chains comply with Conflict Minerals standards, and social responsibility and environmental stewardship initiatives are an integral part of our global operating system.
 Sales and Marketing
 In 2022, no single customer made up more than 5% of consolidated net sales across the company.


Strategy
 One of the key drivers of future growth for both the Electronics and Hydraulics segments is our system sale approach that leverages electronic and hydraulic solutions from our trusted brands. While always protecting our existing business, we will provide strategic OEM partners with “system solutions” that ensure the safety, reliability, connectivity and control of their applications.
Our two segments are comprised of over 125 direct sales and application specialists serving our customers' needs. We will continue to use this long successful approach while augmenting our strategy by pursuing system sales at key global OEM’s to drive growth.
 We will accelerate promotion of the Helios brand through system sales while remaining focused on our well-established operating brands.
Hydraulics
 In 2022, 62% of Helios’ sales were derived from the Hydraulics segment. Our 2022 Hydraulics segment sales were distributed fairly evenly among our three major geographic regions with 36% to the Americas, 34% to Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 30% to Asia Pacific (“APAC”).
We market and sell hydraulic products through value-add distributors and directly to OEMs. Our global channel partner network includes representation in many industrialized markets, and approximately 61% of segment sales are attributed to our channel partners who generally combine our products with other hydraulic components to design a complete hydraulic system. Sales direct to OEMs for integration in their machines make up the remaining 39%. We rely heavily on our distribution network in the U.S., while in the EMEA and APAC regions, sales are split more evenly between OEMs and distributors. Technical support is provided by local sales and application experts based in each region.
Electronics
 Electronic products are sold globally to OEM customers, distributors and system integrators. OEM sales constituted 80% of total Electronics segment sales in 2022. Building strong, lasting partnerships with OEMs is a priority. We rely on direct customer contacts to stimulate demand for our products. We work closely with our OEM customers to design and deliver innovative reliable products for specific applications. Our hardware and software products are designed and modified with the customer utilizing our extensive application knowledge to create unique system level products that cannot be easily replaced by simply switching out components. Twenty-four-hour customer service support and an in-house technical service department is available before, during and after the initial sale to create sustainable partnerships with our customers. Current OEM customers continue to specify our products in new projects based on the high level of engagement, quality products and delivery performance.
Our OEM sales team collaborates with large OEMs, whereas the Distributor sales team works with an expanding number of distributors of varying sizes. Over the last few years, we restructured our sales teams to create a more dedicated focus on distributor sales. Overall, approximately 20% of 2022 segment sales were derived from independent authorized distributor channel partners.
Our new product initiatives in the Electronics Segment are focused on general market products that will require less customization by our engineering teams and provide a quicker sales cycle, making it easier for the products to be utilized in multiple new end markets and OEM applications.
Geographically, our 2022 Electronics segment sales represented 81% to the Americas, 11% to EMEA and 8% to APAC. There is a well-defined initiative to grow sales in EMEA and APAC as part of our growth strategy. Additionally, synergies identified at the time of acquisition utilize customer relationships from the Hydraulics segment to create pull through of electronic products, and joint product development has created additional sales opportunities for both segments. The systems sales approach will further drive pull through between the segments.
Competition
 Hydraulics
 Competitors in the hydraulics market are broken down into three categories: full-line hydraulic systems producers, component-only producers of CVT or QRC products and low-cost producers. Most competitors market globally. Full-line producers, such as Parker Hannifin, Danfoss/Eaton and Bosch Rexroth/HydraForce, can provide complete hydraulic systems to their customers, including components functionally like those manufactured in our Hydraulics segment. Similar to Helios, component-only producers are entities that offer only CVT or QRC products, while additional parts of the hydraulics system are obtained from other manufacturers. These include Delta Power Company, Stucchi and CEJN. Low-cost producers, such as Winner and Valvole Italia, are competitors who have emerged in low-cost production areas such as APAC and Europe. These competitors will typically attempt to copy our products and like products designed by competitors. Low-cost producers generally have a limited product range compared with full line or cartridge valve and quick release coupling only producers, which restricts their ability to be competitive.
We believe that we compete based upon the quality, reliability, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics of our products and services.
 Electronics
 Competition within the electronics market is very broad with competitors ranging from large multinational companies with full electronics offerings, such as Continental and Garmin, to small niche companies that specialize in one product type. Enovation Controls is a niche player in the displays, controllers, gauges and instrumentation panel markets. Balboa is a niche player providing single source control and water flow systems in the health and wellness industry.
The market for products designed and manufactured by Enovation Controls is relatively fragmented with the top four to six companies comprising the majority of the market, mostly servicing the automotive space. Enovation Controls differentiates itself through product quality, customization ability and service with a focus on mid-sized niche markets that are not well served by the large competitors. Our engagement and speed to market set us apart from larger competitors.
Balboa Water Group, including Joyonway, is the largest supplier of integrated end-to-end solutions for the therapy and wellness spa and bath market and is the only supplier capable of providing the full spectrum of components, from controls and displays to pumps and jets. By providing integrated architecture of hardware and software that is customized to match specific OEM products, Balboa creates a value proposition making it difficult to easily switch suppliers.
 Our overall position in our key markets is defensible due to high barriers to switching suppliers, such as up-front engineering and programming costs and positive perceptions among core customers on key selection criteria, including quality and service.
Human Capital
 We believe our employees are fundamental to our success. We are focused on attracting and retaining strong talent and furthering the development of our workforce through programs that not only enhance technical abilities but also strengthen leadership, communication and collaboration skills that contribute to our high performing, team-oriented culture. Helios is committed to attracting and developing a diverse workforce. Our shared values of accountability, integrity, inclusion, innovation and leadership foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for our colleagues and their ideas.



At the end of our 2022 fiscal year, we employed over 2,400 colleagues worldwide. Approximately 55% of our employees are located in the Americas region, 27% in the EMEA region and 18% in APAC. In addition, we have a committed service agreement with a third party that currently supports nearly 500 jobs in Mexico and serves as an integral part of our supply chain. The number of jobs available in Mexico through the third party is flexible based on demand in the health and wellness market. We also hire consultants, independent contractors and temporary workers as needed to augment our workforce.
Employees are guided by our Shared Values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Company and its employees believe that respecting others means recognizing the dignity of every person and embracing diversity around the globe. Helios is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment and encourages diversity in its hiring and employment practices. Our leadership and employees strive to “do the right thing by living with integrity,” which includes caring for communities around the world and the people they employ.
 We guide our people strategy through employee engagement that grows talent, amplifies the employee experience and leverages technology to attract, retain and develop the workforce of the future. We continue to develop our talent through several programs across our businesses. These programs include our Career Development Program (CDP), which targets recent college graduates and working students to provide them with bona fide job rotations aimed at building future leaders throughout critical business disciplines. Additionally, both segments utilize summer internships, partnerships with local educational institutions and ongoing employee training and education. In 2023, we are launching our global talent management system that will encompass Helios’ performance management, learning management and career development. In alignment with our strategy, it is critical that we continue to cultivate, accelerate and elevate our talent across the organization.
The Company is committed to the safety of its employees. Each company within our group maintains environmental, health and safety policies that seek to promote the operation of our business in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of the public and our employees. Several of our businesses have onsite medical clinics for employees and their families. Our companies offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and preventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides professional counseling to employees and their family members.
 We have approximately 550 employees in Italy who are represented by a union. We have constructive and productive dialog on a regular basis with union leaders. To the best of our knowledge, there is no labor dispute, strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending or threatened against or affecting the Company, nor is there any basis for any of the foregoing.
Patents and Trademarks
 In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how and other intellectual property rights, we own approximately 300 active patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products and businesses. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent upon the quality and functional performance of our products and our relationship with the marketplace, rather than on any single patent, trademark, copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights. However, our patents are important in the defense of our intellectual property from competitors who exploit product development that is not otherwise legally protected by its creator.
Governmental Regulations
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including in foreign jurisdictions, relating to our business practices, labor and employment, construction, land use and taxation, among others. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to. However, laws and regulations that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our company can be changed, accelerated or adopted, which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.
 Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act of 2010. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability, and cause a loss of reputation in the market. Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly.
 Export Controls and Trade Policies
 We are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, we are subject to trade and import and export regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC). Our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices, including trade restrictions, tariffs and sanctions.
Environmental Regulations
 Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.
Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 The Company's operations are subject to extensive and stringent governmental regulations including regulations related to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and similar safety and health regulations promulgated in other countries. The Company's employees in its manufacturing facilities operate complicated machinery that may cause substantial injury or death upon malfunction or improper operation. The Company's manufacturing locations are subject to the workplace safety rules and regulations of OSHA and local safety and health laws. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the requirements of these laws. However, in the event that the Company is unable to comply with OSHA or other environmental requirements, the Company could be subject to substantial sanctions, including restrictions on its business operations, monetary liability and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business.
Sustainability
 Corporate responsibility and sustainability are reflected in the Company’s business strategy. The board of directors recently reviewed the Company’s historical commitment to principles of corporate and social responsibility. The Company is committed to reducing emissions, recycling and minimizing its environmental footprint and has implemented several strategies to achieve these goals. The Company is also fully committed to the safety of its employees and the safety of those who use its products. Additionally, the Company actively seeks to support diversity initiatives in its hiring and employment practices. The Board and its committees will continue to assist the Company in its oversight of corporate social responsibilities, significant public policy issues, health and safety and climate-change related trends.
