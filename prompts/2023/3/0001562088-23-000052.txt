Our Mission
Our mission is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available.
Although education can open the door to economic opportunity, it is also among the principal sources of inequality: the privileged can get the best education in the world, while those with fewer resources, especially in developing countries, may not be able to get even basic schooling. That is why we started Duolingo. We believe that everyone, regardless of how wealthy they are, should have access to high quality education. And for the first time in history, the technology necessary to enable this is in the hands of billions of people, in the form of a smartphone. At Duolingo, we build products native to the smartphone—bite-sized, on-demand and engaging—to make learning accessible and effective, opening doors for everyone alike.
Who We Are
Duolingo is a technology company founded by two engineers, Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker. Luis and Severin met at Carnegie Mellon University, where Luis was a professor in the Computer Science Department and Severin was his Ph.D. student. Luis, a MacArthur Fellow, grew up in Guatemala and witnessed firsthand the tremendous impact that access to high quality education can have on people’s lives. Luis and Severin bonded over the dream of building an intelligent learning system informed by massive amounts of user engagement data that could deliver superior learning outcomes.
Our team, which as of December 31, 2022, consisted of over 600 passionate employees, including more than 270 engineers, aims to build the most sophisticated education platform in the world. We believe that by using modern technology, the very best engineering talent, and a mission-driven approach, we can create better learning experiences and meaningful improvements in efficacy. Our products are powered by sophisticated data analytics and artificial intelligence and delivered with world-class art, animation, and design to make it easier for learners to stay motivated, master new material, and achieve their learning goals.
Our Business
With over 800 million downloads to date, our flagship app has organically become the world’s most popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing Education app in the App Stores. For many, Duolingo has become synonymous with language learning: for example, on Google, people search the term “Duolingo” approximately sixteen times more often than “learn Spanish.” We are particularly proud that our learners come from the entire socioeconomic spectrum, ranging from billionaires and celebrities to recently resettled refugees, a rare instance in which more money does not imply better access to a high quality educational platform.
We started with a focus on teaching languages because of the profound impact learning a new language can have on people’s lives, as well as the large market opportunity. According to HolonIQ, approximately 2 billion people across the world are learning a new language, and consumer spend on both online and offline language learning represents about a $60 billion market. Driving much of the demand for language learning is the reality that English can unlock tremendous economic opportunity. According to the World Economic Forum, job seekers around the world with exceptional English skills can expect to earn 30-50% higher salaries than their peers with average English ability. And the power of language learning is not limited to economic advancement. Learning another language can unlock new experiences and deep 
human connections, ranging from navigating a first trip to another country, to communicating with family members of an older generation.
As of December 31, 2022, Duolingo offers courses in over 40 languages to more than 60 million monthly active users. To put our scale in context, there are more people in the United States learning languages on Duolingo than there are foreign language learners in all United States high schools combined, and there are more people learning certain languages on Duolingo, like Irish and Hawaiian, than there are native speakers of those languages worldwide.
Duolingo is the learning product built for the mobile generation: bite-sized, on-demand and fun. We believe that the hardest part of learning something new is staying motivated, so we build gamification features into our platform to motivate our learners, and we run thousands of A/B tests to optimize each feature for maximum engagement. Our obsession with user experience has yielded affinity and loyalty in our learners, which in turn has helped us cultivate millions of brand advocates who tell their friends and families about our products. Our brand has become part of pop culture, appearing in internet memes and in sketches on late night comedy shows. As an example, #duolingo on TikTok has approximately two billion views, and our official account has been highlighted by numerous press outlets. All of this has allowed us to grow our business organically, primarily relying on word-of-mouth virality rather than paid user acquisition. 
Our millions of learners complete over 900 million exercises every day, creating what we believe to be the world's largest learning dataset. This data powers the high volume A/B testing and novel artificial intelligence (“AI”) that we use to continually improve how well we teach. According to an internal study, Duolingo learners who were assessed at the completion of our beginner-level content, learn as much as students taking four university semesters of language education.
We intentionally do not put our learning content behind a paywall. Anyone can download the Duolingo app, use it for as long as they like, and complete as many of our courses as they choose, all without paying anything. Learners who use Duolingo for free see an ad at the end of each lesson, whereas learners who purchase Super Duolingo, our premium subscription, enjoy an ad-free experience and access to additional features. As of December 31, 2022 approximately 8% of our monthly active users were paid subscribers of Super Duolingo. Our paid subscriber penetration has increased steadily since we launched Super Duolingo in 2017 and, combined with our user growth, has led to revenue growth each year since. We have a strong future roadmap of feature improvements and optimizations, and believe we are in the early stages of increasing our paid subscriber penetration.
Our freemium business model, which means allowing users to access our content for free and charging a subscription for additional features, is core to our success because it enables significant user scale. Our growth and competitive differentiation have been driven by two mutually-reinforcing flywheels: our learning flywheel and our investment flywheel.
•Learning flywheel: The greater the scale of our learner base, the more we can use insights from data analytics to improve both engagement and efficacy. The more engaging our products are, and the more effectively we teach, the more our learners tell their friends about Duolingo and the more we continue to grow our learner base.
•Investment flywheel: The scale of our learner base and word-of-mouth growth allow us to focus our capital investments on product innovation and data analytics, as opposed to brand or performance marketing. The more learners use Duolingo and convert into paid subscribers, the more we are able to invest in creating an even more delightful, engaging and effective learning experience. In turn, this increases our popularity and user scale, as well as the effectiveness of our data analytics, further widening our competitive moat.
In 2016, we launched the Duolingo English Test, an online, on-demand assessment of English proficiency. Every year, millions of people around the world seek to demonstrate English proficiency for a variety of reasons, including university admissions, work visas, and job applications. We developed the Duolingo English Test because language assessment has lacked innovation, with the most popular English proficiency tests still administered in physical testing centers and usually costing hundreds of dollars per test. By offering a more accessible, online option that is both rigorous and accurate, we provide greater opportunities for aspiring students and professionals dependent on successful completion of these high stakes assessments. As of December 2022, over 3,800 higher education programs around the world accept the Duolingo English Test results as proof of English proficiency for international student admissions. These include the top 25 undergraduate programs ranked by international enrollment, as well as top schools such as Yale, Stanford, MIT, Duke and Columbia. 
We believe that there is an opportunity to diversify the scope of our platform beyond language learning to a variety of subjects, using the same product-focused, mobile-first, gamified approach to education. In 2020 we launched Duolingo ABC, an app for young children that teaches early literacy skills, which won the 2020 Time Magazine “Best New Product” award. In 2022 we launched Duolingo Math, an app where students can focus on elementary math, which covers classroom topics, or adults can focus on brain training, which strengthens mental math skills. We believe new products will leverage our scalable technology platform and benefit from our core competencies in product development, gamification and use of advanced data-driven analytics to deliver quantifiable efficacy. We believe that expanding the scope of our platform to additional learning subjects will further expand our addressable market.
The Duolingo Learning Experience
The Duolingo learning experience sits at the rare intersection of fun and self-improvement. Learners love Duolingo because:
•It's fun. Duolingo feels more like a mobile game than an education product. Our bite-sized lessons and gamification features motivate learners to come back each day to continue learning. As of December 2022, there were over 10 million daily active users with a 7-day streak or longer, and over 2.5 million daily active users with a 365-day streak or longer.
•It's effective. Learners stick with Duolingo at first because it’s fun, and then over time also because they find that it works. Our expert-designed courses help learners build robust speaking, reading, listening, and writing skills, and our data analytics power personalization and superior learning outcomes. For more information about the Duolingo Method please visit https://www.duolingo.com/efficacy.
•It's free. Every language course on Duolingo is free to access. Learners can spend as much time learning as they want and complete any and every course without paying. This lowers barriers to start learning and to keep learning.
In a world where people are increasingly engaged in immersive, bite-sized, mobile-first experiences, we provide such an experience that also results in learning valuable skills. Indeed, many of our learners prefer to spend time on Duolingo rather than on social media or mobile games because they can learn while still feeling entertained. 
Each of our learning and gamification features is carefully crafted to contribute to a learner experience that is defined by several key principles:
•Low friction. Beginning the learning journey on Duolingo is easy. Learners select the language they want to learn and are asked to indicate a daily learning goal, which can be as little as five or ten minutes a day. Duolingo is recognized as a gold standard for user experience design, with our onboarding flows used as examples of industry best practices. 
•Motivating game mechanics. Because we believe that staying motivated is the hardest part of learning something new, we focus relentlessly on keeping learners engaged. Features like Streaks and Leaderboards motivate learners to come back to Duolingo every day, and to spend more time learning each time they do. Ultimately, the high engagement driven by gamification leads to consistent learning and demonstrable efficacy.
•Beautiful design and engaging storytelling. We focus obsessively on every detail of design. From the precise shape and color of each button, to the mood of the celebratory animations that congratulate learners upon finishing each lesson, our app is calibrated to maximize learners’ delight. 
•Diverse learning experiences informed by robust pedagogy. Our learning experiences are designed by an in-house team of experts in learning science and second language acquisition. Content in our largest courses is aligned to the Common European Framework of Reference (“CEFR”), an international standard for language proficiency, and the pedagogical structure of each course is unique. For example, Spanish-speakers learning English will encounter a different curriculum than Chinese-speakers learning English. 
•Application of data analytics and artificial intelligence to optimize learning. We use data from over 900 million exercises completed daily to train sophisticated machine learning algorithms that we deploy to improve learning efficacy. One example of this is our personalization algorithm, called BirdBrain, which is designed to predict the probability that a given learner will get an exercise right or wrong. We use BirdBrain to craft lessons that cater to a learner’s specific proficiency level by providing exercises of the appropriate difficulty. This personalization increases learner motivation and improves learning outcomes.
◦Measurable learning outcomes. All this adds up to a learning experience that helps learners achieve their goals. We have conducted several formal studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Duolingo courses. For the Spanish and French courses, Duolingo learners who completed beginner-level content performed comparably to US university students at the end of their fourth semester of Spanish or French. For the English courses, Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking learners who completed beginner-level content demonstrated average reading and listening comprehension abilities at the top of the intermediate ACTFL proficiency scale. For more information about these studies, visit duolingo.com/efficacy.
Our Technology Platform
Technology is at the core of everything we do. We utilize the latest in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics, along with a relentless focus on A/B testing, to fuel our differentiated learning experience. 
Highlights of our technology platform include:
•Large data moat. With almost a billion exercises completed every day on our platform, we believe we have built the world's largest collection of language-learning data. We leverage this data by developing novel AI models at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and cognitive science, which enable personalized instruction and power new product features that drive both engagement and efficacy.
•Robust testing framework. The foundation of our product strategy is our relentless focus on improving learner engagement through A/B testing, and we run hundreds of A/B tests on new product features each quarter. Experiments can be as simple as changing the text or color of a button, or as complex as adding a major new feature like Leaderboards. The velocity of our A/B testing capabilities is a core competency that allows us to optimize the Duolingo learning experience at a rapid pace.
•Advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities. Our machine learning capabilities allow us to leverage our data to optimize the learning experience. One example of this is our machine learning tools that evaluate every learner’s answer to every exercise every day and learns to predict the probability that any learner will answer any given exercise correctly. We use these tools to adaptively construct lessons where each exercise is “just right” in terms of difficulty for each learner. And our expertise in AI and machine learning also allow us to effectively and efficiently integrate external AI models to improve our products.
•Shared infrastructure. Products across our platform, like our flagship Duolingo language learning app, Duolingo ABC, Duolingo Math and the Duolingo English Test, share a singular technology infrastructure, which allows us to leverage operational efficiencies in implementing new features for each. With our shared infrastructure, we are able to innovate at a higher velocity.
•Strict data protection and privacy standards. We are committed to abiding by the strictest privacy standards and do not sell personal data to outside parties.

Duolingo Math
Launched in 2022, Duolingo Math is a free app where students can focus on elementary math, which covers classroom topics, or adults can focus on brain training, which strengthens mental math skills.
People and Culture 
Attracting and retaining amazing talent is key to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 600 employees. Most of our employees are located at our headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and we also have offices in New York, Seattle, Detroit, Beijing and Berlin. We believe that being located outside of Silicon Valley has helped us cultivate a unique company culture.
Fundamental to Duolingo's culture is our mission orientation. Our mission tends to attract a certain kind of person. Our employees have a very strong sense of social responsibility and are interested in solving hard problems for the benefit of humanity. Over time, we have also developed nine “operating principles” that articulate our values as a company and help guide how we make decisions.
•Learners first. Our mission and reason for existing is to make sure everyone in the world has access to high-quality education.
•Take the long view. If it works in the short-term but hurts Duolingo in the long-term, it’s not right. We make decisions that keep us moving toward our big goals.
•Prioritize ruthlessly. We can’t execute on every good idea. We prioritize the few ideas with the greatest impact so we can put our best efforts behind them.
•Strive for excellence. To change how the world learns, we must do world-class work. From the people we hire to the features we ship, we never settle for just okay.
•We haven’t won yet. Until every person who wants to learn is doing so with Duolingo, we need to keep innovating, pushing the envelope, and learning ways to get better.
•Test everything. We measure and test everything so we can make informed decisions based on data.
•Ship it. For a good idea to become reality, it needs a plan and a sense of urgency. So go go go!
•All for one, and one for all. We stay engaged and make choices that benefit the greater good — because Duolingo’s success is our success.
•Be candid and kind. We build things together with transparency and care for each other. We offer feedback compassionately but with excellence in mind, and receive it openly and as an opportunity to grow.
As a result of our mission, our culture, and the challenges we work on every day, we believe we have had great success in attracting the best talent. We have a very selective recruitment process: we hire one out of every 370 applicants. We recruit interns and new graduates from the top computer science, design, and business programs in the country. We also recruit experienced professionals from top technology companies—and many of them relocate from Silicon Valley to Pittsburgh. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging is also core to who we are. We are proud to say that Duolingo was founded by two immigrants and that our employees come from over 30 countries. More than half of our employees are women-identifying or people of color. Approximately 30% of our executive team are women-identifying, including our Chief People Officer and Chief Engineering Officer. Today, our engineering organization is more than 30% women-identifying. 
Sales & Marketing
For almost a decade, Duolingo’s learner community has grown organically through word-of-mouth virality. In recent years, we have made investments in marketing to supplement our organic model and amplify the voices of our existing users. Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include:
•Brand campaigns. Our brand marketing increases awareness of Duolingo through online and offline campaigns that drive press, social sharing, and more word-of-mouth virality. Investments in our brand enable us to drive long-term growth by attracting new learners to our platform and keeping existing learners engaged. We leverage our iconic brand on social media platforms to drive organic new user growth and engagement with entertaining content, instead of promotional content, that takes advantage of viral trends.
•Owned media marketing. Our owned media marketing engages our learner community, creating millions of brand advocates who drive word-of-mouth virality by sharing their love of Duolingo within their networks. We send our learners personalized emails and push notifications that provide progress reports, lesson reminders, and sometimes a simple message of positivity to encourage them to remain engaged.
•Paid acquisition. We complement and accelerate our organic user growth with strategic and targeted paid user acquisition. Our performance marketing strategy is focused on targeting high quality user segments around the world that are more likely to retain well as users and/or subscribe.
•Geographic expansion. In markets where our organic awareness is relatively low and opportunity for growth is strong, we hire experienced local marketing managers and engage in localized social media and influencer-led campaigns, app store optimization, and paid advertising to generate interest in our products and drive new learner growth.
Industry Trends
We believe the following market trends will contribute to the continued success of our platform: 
•Mobile-first behaviors are reshaping industries. In categories ranging from retail to music to dating, consumers are increasingly gravitating to mobile, app-based experiences. We believe that consumer behavior will continue to be shaped by a preference for the convenient, on-demand nature of mobile experiences.
•The shift towards online learning is accelerating. Historically, education has lagged behind other industries in the shift from offline to online. However, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the already growing shift towards online learning, and we believe its effects are likely to be enduring. 
•Online learners seek engaging, mobile-first experiences. Consumers are increasingly accustomed to the highly engaging design of social media apps and mobile games. We believe that consumers turning to online learning will not only prefer the convenience and control that mobile apps provide, but also expect experiences to be highly engaging.
•Artificial intelligence will increasingly shape online learning. Rapid advances in generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), will change how people use technology to learn. We believe that this trend will continue to accelerate, and that it will offer an almost unimaginable set of opportunities for companies at the nexus of technology and education to teach at scale. 
•Adoption of subscription models is growing globally. Rising adoption of subscription models across the globe is further enabling the shift towards mobile experiences. We believe that as 
subscriptions increase in popularity across categories, consumers will also gravitate towards subscription models in online learning.
Competition
We believe that our relentless focus on building an engaging and effective language learning product, powered by our freemium model, has led to a leading market position, as measured by downloads, active users, and brand awareness. However, learners have a variety of options when choosing to learn a language. We compete for learners’ time, attention, and share of wallet not only with other online and app-based language learning platforms but also with offline forms of language learning. Because of the extensibility of the Duolingo platform beyond language learning, we also compete with language learning assessment providers and literacy platforms.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends primarily on the following factors:
•Continued growth in internet access and mobile adoption around the world;
•Our ability to continue to increase our learner base through organic, word-of-mouth growth;
•Our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand;
•The scale, growth and engagement of our learners relative to those of our competitors;
•Our ability to introduce new, and improve on existing, features and products in response to competition, learner preferences, and market and industry trends; and
•Our ability to continue developing new monetization features and improving on existing features.
Intellectual Property
We own several trademarks that have been registered, or for which registration applications are pending, in the United States as well as in a number of foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks include, among others, the word marks “Duolingo” and Duolingo in Chinese, and certain logos used in connection with our business, including our mascot Duo. The registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically provided we comply with all applicable renewal requirements, including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in the applicable jurisdictions in connection with certain goods and services. We may consider pursuing trademark registrations for additional marks and for additional jurisdictions if and to the extent we believe such registrations would be beneficial to our business and cost-effective.
We have registered several domain names, including www.duolingo.com, and we own several registered copyrights covering logos and characters used in our business, including Duo. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further protect the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our user terms of use on our website and in our agreements with service providers. 
In addition to the described trademark and domain name protection, Duolingo has filed two patent applications directed to proprietary techniques we developed for generating language proficiency test questions and evaluating language proficiency as part of an on-going program to identify and protect innovations developed by the Company. We expect that this program will continue and increase in size going forward. For information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to many US federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, payment processing, disability rights, digital accessibility standards, content regulation, intellectual property, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in new and rapidly evolving industries.
We collect and use personal information to create online accounts, process e-commerce transactions, provide customer service, support, and for other purposes. The regulatory framework for data protection, privacy and information security is evolving rapidly. For example, the US Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use and dissemination of data, the presentation of website or other electronic content, and broad commercial and digital marketing activities, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security and access, among other things. Courts may also adopt these developing standards. A number of states, including but not limited to California and Virginia, have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the personal information received from consumers, and imposing new requirements around the collection, use, sharing, and handling of data collected from or about consumers or their devices. In many cases, the specific limitations imposed by these standards are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities. In addition, federal and state regulators have interpreted various rules and regulations as requiring companies like ours to implement reasonable data security controls and measures.
We are also subject to laws that govern specific types of data and/or specific types of marketing or other consumer engagement activities. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) applies to operators of commercial websites and online services directed to US children under the age of 13 that collect personal information from children and to operators of general audience sites that have actual knowledge that they are collecting information from US children under the age of 13. Our language learning app is aimed at a general audience and we employ an age-gating procedure whereby anyone from the United States identifying themselves as being under the age of 13 during the registration process receives an ad-free version of the service, with special enrollment procedures and restricted information practices. We also apply age-gating for non-US users of the language learning app according to foreign laws. The Duolingo English Test service requires parental consent for users under the age of 13. The Duolingo ABC app is aimed at users under the age of 13 but does not collect personal information directly from the user beyond that required to use the app. Other laws such as the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act ("ROSCA") and analogous state laws require certain and consent mechanisms, among other things, in relation to recurring payments and subscription based products or services. These rules are enforcement by federal and state regulators and can subject companies to significant penalties, fines and injunctive relief. In addition, federal and state agencies regularly investigate and bring enforcement actions under general unfair or deceptive acts or practices laws (referred to as "UDAP" statutes) in relation to a broad array of sales, marketing and advertising activities.
We also have many subscribers who access and pay for our services from outside the United States. Foreign data protection, e-commerce, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive or burdensome than those in the United States, and those governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with US governmental entities. For example, in the EEA we are subject to the GDPR and in the UK we are subject to the UK GDPR. The GDPR and the UK GDPR impose strict data protection compliance requirements including: providing detailed disclosures about how personal data is collected and 
processed (in a concise, intelligible and easily-accessible form); demonstrating that an appropriate legal basis is in place or otherwise exists to justify data processing activities; granting new rights for data subjects in regard to their personal data (including the right to be “forgotten” and the right to data portability), as well as enhancing data subject rights (e.g., data subject access requests); introducing the obligation to notify data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected individuals) of significant data breaches; defining for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; imposing limitations on retention of personal data; maintaining a record of processing activities; and complying with the principle of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit.
