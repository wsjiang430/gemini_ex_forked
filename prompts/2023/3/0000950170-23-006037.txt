ITEM 1. Business.

Our primary goal is to empower the global community to improve health and wellness by providing access to accurate essential information through effortless tests, collection kits and services. Our business previously consisted of two segments: our “Diagnostics” segment, and our “Molecular Solutions” segment.
 
In February 2023, we announced a corporate restructuring to combine the commercial and innovation teams across the two segments into one business unit with sales, marketing, product development and research teams covering multiple product lines. This change is intended to accelerate innovation, enhance customer experience and result in operational synergies.
 
Diagnostics
 
Our Diagnostics business primarily consists of the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of simple, easy to use diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary technologies, as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types. The Diagnostics business includes tests for diseases including COVID-19, HIV and Hepatitis C that are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care, and tests for drugs of abuse that are processed in a laboratory. These products are sold in the United States and internationally to various clinical laboratories, hospitals, clinics, community-based organizations, and other public health organizations, distributors, government agencies, physicians’ offices, and commercial and industrial entities. Our COVID-19 and HIV products are also sold in a consumer-friendly format in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market in the U.S. and, in the case of the HIV product, as a self-test to individuals in a number of other countries. In 2022, after obtaining a CE mark, we launched our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test, an oral swab in-home test for HIV-1 and HIV-2, in Europe, making it available in several European countries. Through our Diagnostics business we are also developing and commercializing products that measure adherence to HIV medications including pre-exposure prophylaxis ("PrEP").

In September 2022, we entered into an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (“BARDA”), pursuant to which BARDA will provide $8.6 million in funding to us to develop a 2nd generation Ebola test on the OraQuick® testing platform, with the objective of developing increased sensitivity and shelf life, with new chemistry and higher degrees of automation in the test’s manufacturing process.
 
Molecular Solutions
 
Our Molecular Solutions business is operated by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, DNA Genotek, Diversigen, and Novosanis. Our Molecular Solutions business sells its products and services directly to its customers, primarily through its internal sales force in the U.S. domestic market, and in many international markets, and also through distributors. Our products primarily consist of collection kits and services used by clinical laboratories, direct-to-consumer laboratories, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and animal health service and product providers. Most of our Molecular Solutions revenues are derived from product sales to commercial customers and sales into the academic and research markets. A significant portion of our total sales is from repeat customers in both markets.  Molecular Solutions customers span the disease risk management, diagnostics, pharmaceutical, biotech, nutrition, companion animal and environmental markets.
 
In 2020, we expanded the market focus of our Molecular Solutions business by selling existing collection products for use with COVID-19 tests. In 2022, demand for COVID-19 PCR testing declined, which was primarily driven by the availability of antigen tests, the reduction in the numer of COVID-19 cases, and the wider availability of vaccines that negatively impacted the sales of the collection products. We have also developed additional collection devices for the emerging microbiome market, which focuses on studying microbiomes and their effect on human and animal health. In 2022, we launched the OMNIgene®  GUT Dx collection device (OMD-200), which was granted De Novo authorization from the FDA for collection of human fecal samples and the stabilization of DNA from the bacterial community for subsequent assessment of the microbiome profile by an assay validated for use with OMNIgene®·GUT Dx device. Additionally, our OMNIgene®  GUT DNA and RNA collection device (OMR-205), became available to gut microbiome researchers, allowing for self-collection, stabilization, storage and transportation of microbial DNA and RNA at ambient temperature for gut microbiome profiling. We leverage our existing sales force and global research connections to engage microbiome customers worldwide to establish ourselves among the leaders in ease-of-collection, stabilization, and transport of this challenging sample type. Through our partnership with Grifols, we received FDA clearance for our ORAcollect®Dx saliva collection device for OTC use, which allows our commercial partners to use and market the device with their therapeutics or devices.

Our Molecular Solutions products include the Colli-Pee® device, developed and sold by our Novosanis subsidiary, for the volumetric collection of first void urine. This product is in its early stages, and initial sales are occurring primarily through distributors and

collaborations in the liquid biopsy and sexually transmitted disease markets.  In 2022, Novosanis obtained a CE mark for its Colli-Pee® device containing a prefilled tube with UAS® chemistry, which is designed to stabilize urinary analytes. Our Diversigen subsidiary also offers laboratory and analytical services for both genomics and microbiome customers to more fully meet their needs. These services are primarily provided to pharmaceutical, biotech companies, and research institutions.

In 2022, Diversigen launched its metatranscriptomics sequencing and analysis services for gut microbiome samples, which generate a microbial community’s gene expression profile to provide information about the interactions between an individual and their microbiome, creating a holistic picture of a sample’s microbial functions and expression levels.
 
Business Update Related to InteliSwab® Covid-19 Rapid Tests
 
In June 2021, we received three Emergency Use Authorizations ("EUA") from the FDA for our InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Tests (“InteliSwab®”) for non-prescription OTC, professional point-of-care use and prescription home use. We began recording revenues on the sales of our InteliSwab® tests during the third quarter of 2021. In January 2022, InteliSwab® received FDA authorization for pediatric use in children ages 2 to 14. In September 2021, the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) awarded the Company a procurement contract for the InteliSwab® tests for OTC use, which the DLA estimated to have a value of $205 million and which will provide InteliSwab® tests to up to 20,000 sites throughout the United States. In 2022, the Company began to deliver tests to sites throughout the United States under this contract, and DLA has provided delivery orders against which it can continue to issue shipping instructions into 2023. On November 22, 2022, the DLA awarded us a second procurement contract for the InteliSwab® tests for OTC use. Under the terms of the award, the contract estimate is 18 million tests, with a maximum award of 36 million tests and a guaranteed minimum award of 3.6 million tests. The contract will run from November 2022 through November 2023. In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") awarded the Company a fully funded firm fixed price contract for a total of 3.2 million InteliSwab® tests which were delivered in February 2023. In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with BARDA, which is part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS, pursuant to which BARDA would provide the Company with up to $13.6 million in funding to obtain clearance of a premarket notification ("510(k)") and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) waiver of the InteliSwab® tests. In May, 2022, InteliSwab® was selected by HHS to be distributed across the United States for nationwide school testing.

Through 2022, we have scaled up our operations to meet the increased demand for the InteliSwab® tests. We significantly expanded our United States production capacity for InteliSwab® tests to achieve capacity targets, set out in our 2021 contract with the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD") (in coordination with the HHS), of more than 100 million tests annually.
 
Conclusion of Exploration of Strategic Alternatives
 
In 2021, our Board of Directors announced that it would explore and evaluate a broad range of strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for stockholders. In May, 2022, our Board of Directors concluded its review of strategic alternatives without a transaction.
Diagnostics Products
 
The following is a summary of our principal Diagnostics products for the infectious disease and risk management markets:
 
InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test
 
InteliSwab® is our rapid immunoassay product designed to test nasal samples for the presence of antigen from SARS-CoV-2. The device uses an integrated swab to collect a specimen from the lower nostril. After collection, the integrated swab is inserted into a vial containing a pre-measured amount of developer solution to facilitate flow of the sample into the device. The specimen and developer solution flow through the test device and test results are observable in 30 minutes. The InteliSwab® test has received EUA from the FDA for non-prescription, OTC home use in individuals aged two years or older, with symptoms within the first seven (7) days of onset when tested at least twice over a three-day period with at least 48 hours between tests and without symptoms or epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 when tested at least three times over a five-day period with at least 48 hours between tests.
 
In 2022, the InteliSwab® test became available for purchase on Amazon’s online store to customers in the United States. The tests are sold and orders fulfilled by Amazon.

InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Pro
 
The InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Pro is a version of InteliSwab® intended for use by healthcare providers at the point of care. The test is performed in the same manner as the OTC version, except that the test is run and interpreted by a healthcare provider. This test

has received EUA from the FDA for use by laboratories located in the United States certified under CLIA. We have also received a CLIA waiver for use of the test, which enables the test to be used by numerous additional sites in the United States, which are not certified under CLIA, to perform high and moderately complex tests. These additional sites include outreach clinics, community-based organizations and physicians’ offices. This test is also indicated for individuals aged 2 years and older, with and without symptoms of COVID-19.
 
InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Rx
 
The InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Rx is the version of InteliSwab® that has received EUA from the FDA for prescription home use with individuals aged 2 years or older who are suspected of COVID-19 infection by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset.
 
OraQuick® Rapid HIV Test

The OraQuick® Rapid HIV Test is our rapid point-of-care test product designed to test oral fluid, whole blood (i.e., both finger-stick and venous), plasma and serum samples for the presence of various antibodies. The device uses a porous flat pad to collect an oral fluid specimen. After collection, the pad is inserted into a vial containing a pre-measured amount of developer solution and allowed to develop. When blood, plasma or serum is to be tested, a loop collection device is used to collect a drop of the specimen and mix it in the developer solution, after which the collection pad is inserted into the solution and allowed to develop. In all cases, the specimen and developer solution then flow through the testing device where test results are observable in approximately 20 minutes. The OraQuick® device is a screening test and requires a confirmation test where an initial positive result is obtained. This product is sold under the OraQuick ADVANCE® name in North America, Europe and certain other countries and under the OraQuick® name in other developing countries. The test has received approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application from the FDA for the detection of antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in oral fluid, finger-stick whole blood, venous whole blood and plasma. This test is available for use by laboratories located in the United States certified under CLIA, to perform moderately complex tests. We have also received a CLIA waiver for use of the test with oral fluid and finger-stick and venous whole blood. As a result, the test can be used by numerous additional sites in the United States not certified under CLIA to perform moderately complex tests, such as outreach clinics, community-based organizations and physicians’ offices.

On the international front, we have obtained a CE mark for our OraQuick ADVANCE® test so that we can sell this product in Europe and other countries accepting the CE mark for commercialization and this product is registered for sale in other countries. We have distributors in place for several countries and are seeking to increase awareness and expand our distribution network for this product throughout the world. We have also received World Health Organization (“WHO”) pre-qualification for our export-only version of this product.

OraQuick® In-Home HIV Test

The OraQuick® In-Home HIV test is an OTC oral-fluid only version of our OraQuick ADVANCE® HIV 1/2 Antibody Test. We received PMA approval to sell this test in the U.S. OTC market. The In-Home test is performed in the same manner as the OraQuick ADVANCE® test, except that it has product labeling and instructions designed for consumers. In addition, we have established toll-free, 24/7, 365-day per year customer telephone support to provide additional information and referral services for consumers that use this product.

OraQuick® HIV Self-Test

The OraQuick® HIV Self-Test is sold for use by individuals in certain foreign countries, including under the CE mark in certain European countries, to meet the needs of those markets. This product has received WHO pre-qualification and is eligible for procurement by purchasing entities entitled to access funding and other resources from the Global Fund, UNITAID and other agencies.

OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Test

Another test available on the OraQuick® platform is the OraQuick® HCV rapid antibody test. This product is a qualitative test that can detect antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), in a variety of sample types. The OraQuick® HCV test operates in substantially the same manner as the OraQuick ADVANCE®HIV test.

We have received FDA PMA approval and CLIA waiver for use of the test in detecting HCV antibodies in venous whole blood and finger-stick whole blood specimens, making it the first and only rapid HCV test approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The OraQuick® HCV test has received a CE mark for use with oral fluid, venous whole blood, finger-stick whole blood, plasma and serum and is sold in Europe. This CE-marked product is also registered and sold in other foreign countries and has received WHO pre-qualification.


OraQuick® Ebola Rapid Antigen Test

We have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our rapid Ebola test, making it the first and only rapid Ebola test cleared for sale in the U.S. This product utilizes the OraQuick® technology platform for the detection of Ebola antigen and can be used with finger-stick and whole blood samples from live patients and oral fluid samples from recently deceased individuals. The uses for this test are limited to individuals that meet certain criteria indicating they may be infected with the Ebola virus, so the test is not available for general screening of individuals that do not meet this criteria.
 
In September 2022, we entered into an agreement with BARDA, pursuant to which BARDA will provide up to $8.6 million in funding to us to develop a 2nd generation Ebola test on the OraQuick® testing platform.

OraSure® Collection Device

Our OraSure® oral fluid collection device is used in conjunction with screening and confirmatory tests for HIV-1 antibodies. The generic version of this product can be used for other analytes. This device consists of a small, treated cotton-fiber pad on a handle that is placed in a person’s mouth for two to five minutes. The device collects oral mucosal transudate, a serum-derived fluid that contains higher concentrations of certain antibodies and analytes than saliva. As a result, oral mucosal transudate testing is a highly accurate method for detecting HIV-1 infection and other analytes.

The OraSure® collection device is FDA approved for use in the detection of HIV-1 antibodies. The generic version is a Class I medical device for the detection of cocaine and cotinine in oral fluid specimens for risk assessment testing. HIV-1 antibody detection using the OraSure® collection device involves three steps:
•Collection of an oral fluid specimen using the OraSure® device; 
 •Screening of the specimen for HIV-1 antibodies at a laboratory with an enzyme immunoassay (“EIA”) screening test approved by the FDA for use with the OraSure® device; and 
 •Laboratory confirmation of any positive screening test results with a blood-based nucleic acid test. 
 
A trained health care professional then conveys test results and provides appropriate counseling to the individual who was tested.

Intercept® Drug Testing System

A collection device that is substantially similar to the OraSure® collection device is sold under the name Intercept®, and is used to collect oral mucosal transudate for oral fluid drug testing. We have received FDA 510(k) clearance to use the Intercept® collection device with laboratory-based EIAs to test for drugs-of-abuse commonly identified by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) as the NIDA-5 (i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC” or marijuana), cocaine, opiates, amphetamines/methamphetamines and phencyclidine (“PCP”)), and for barbiturates, methadone and benzodiazepines. Each of these EIAs is also FDA 510(k) cleared for use with the Intercept® device. Our Intercept® device and oral fluid assays are sold in the U.S. primarily through laboratory distributors.

We believe that the Intercept® device has several advantages over competing urine and other drugs-of-abuse testing products, including its lower total testing cost, its non-invasive nature, mobility and accuracy, the ease of maintaining a chain-of-custody, the treatment of test subjects with greater dignity, no requirement for specially-prepared collection facilities and difficulty of sample adulteration. The availability of an oral fluid test is intended to allow our customers to test for drug impairment and eliminate scheduling costs and inconvenience, thereby streamlining the testing process.

We have also developed a next-generation collection device, which we are marketing under the trade name “Intercept i2® he”. This device offers several important advantages over our original Intercept® device, including a sample adequacy indicator that provides a visual prompt when the appropriate volume of oral fluid has been collected, the ability to collect a larger sample required by current laboratory testing protocols and a more optimized chemistry that results in improved recovery of the targeted drug analytes. The Intercept i2®he device is currently being sold as a forensic use only device within the criminal justice and drug treatment markets along with a NIDA-5 panel of fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays that we distribute under an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific.
 
Immunoassay Tests and Reagents

We develop and sell immunoassay tests in formats, known as MICRO-PLATE and AUTO-LYTE®, to meet the specific needs of our customers. We also sell fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays developed under our agreement with Thermo Fisher.

Our MICRO-PLATE tests can be performed on commonly used instruments and can detect drugs in urine, serum and sweat specimens. MICRO-PLATE tests are also used as part of the Intercept® product line to detect drugs-of-abuse in oral fluid specimens and we are selling a NIDA-5 panel of microplate assays supplied by Thermo Fisher to the U.S. forensic market under the agreement described above. AUTO-LYTE® tests are sold in the form of bottles of liquid reagents, are run on commercially available laboratory-based automated analytical instruments, and are typically used in high volume, automated, commercial reference insurance laboratories to detect certain drugs or chemicals in urine.

Q.E.D.® Saliva Alcohol Test

Our Q.E.D.® saliva alcohol test is a point-of-care test device that is a cost-effective alternative to breath or blood alcohol testing. The test is a quantitative, saliva-based method for the detection of ethanol, has been cleared for sale by the FDA and has received a CLIA waiver. The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has also approved the test.

Each Q.E.D.® test kit contains a collection stick that is used to collect a sample of saliva and a disposable detection device that displays results in a format similar to a thermometer. The Q.E.D.® device is easy to operate and instrumentation is not required to read the result. The product has a testing range of 0 to 0.145% blood alcohol and produces results in approximately two minutes.

Molecular Solutions Products
 
Genomic Products
 
We sell many genomic products that provide all-in-one systems for the collection, stabilization, transportation, and storage of DNA, RNA, as well as both DNA and RNA together from human and animal biological samples. Our lead products are sold under the Oragene® and ORAcollect® brands and are used to collect genetic material from human saliva. These products are currently sold to thousands of academic research and commercial customers in many countries worldwide. In 2022, we received FDA clearance for our ORAcollect®Dx saliva collection device for OTC use through our partnership with Grifols, which allows our commercial partners to use and legally market the device with their assays when used in conjunction with their intended uses.
 
Our genomic products are available in several configurations and contain proprietary chemical solutions optimized for the specific application for which each product is designed. Product physical design is focused on ease-of-use and reliability for self or assisted collection of samples. For example, several of the Oragene® products require users to hold the product close to their mouth and spit into the collection device. When the container is closed, the reagents stored in the container’s lid are mixed with the captured saliva and stabilize and preserve the nucleic acids in the sample. This non-invasive collection method yields nucleic acid that remains stable at ambient temperature for extended periods. The stabilizing technology ensures the preservation of high quality and high quantity nucleic acids required for many genetic testing and analysis methods.

We believe these products provide significant advantages over competing DNA and RNA collection methods such as blood collection or buccal swabs, particularly in human genetic applications.

Benefits include:
 •Reliable high-quality and stable genetic samples.
 •Simple, non-invasive collection methods.
 •The ability to store and transport collected samples for extended periods at ambient temperatures.
 •Compatibility with fully automated laboratory testing systems. 
 
We also sell the Colli-Pee® collection device for the volumetric collection of first void urine samples. This product is used in liquid biopsy applications for the prostate and bladder cancer markets and in the sexually transmitted infection screening market.
 

COVID Collection Products
 
Since 2020, we have actively engaged with several laboratories and researchers to demonstrate the effectiveness of our existing collection products for use with COVID-19 molecular testing. We believe that oral samples collected using devices from our product lines for liquid saliva or oral swab samples are a suitable alternative to more commonly used samples collected with a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab. As a result, since 2020, we have sold our ORAcollect®  RNA and OMNIgene®  ORAL collection devices for use in connection with COVID-19 molecular testing. Due in part to the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases and the shift toward

the use of antigen testing, the demand for COVID-19 PCR testing declined in 2022, which negatively impacted the sales of our collection products.
 
Microbiome Products

We also market several microbiome collection products designed to collect, stabilize, and transport the microbial profile from multiple sample types. When unstabilized, a microbiome sample can change when exposed to environmental fluctuations, such as temperature changes. Our microbiome collection products support collecting and stabilizing metabolites found in fecal samples by capturing and preserving the microbiome after collection until the desired analysis can be performed.

Our OMNIgene®  GUT product is an all-in-one system designed to enable an individual to easily self-collect high-quality microbial DNA from feces or stool samples for gut microbiome profiling for use in the clinical laboratory and research settings. In 2022, our OMNIgene®  GUT DNA and RNA collection device (OMR-205), became available to gut microbiome researchers, allowing for self-collection, stabilization, storage and transportation of microbial DNA and RNA at ambient temperature for gut microbiome profiling. Most current methodologies for gut microbiome profiling have distinct shortcomings due to the introduction of bias, leading to a lack of reproducibility in the field. We believe our product ensures that the microbial DNA and RNA in the fecal sample are fully stabilized immediately upon collection and maintains an accurate and reliable bacterial profile for weeks at room temperature. Recently, we have applied these principles of sample stabilization to other sample types, including oral, skin, and vaginal samples.

We also launched the OMNIgene®GUT Dx collection device (OMD-200), which was granted De Novo authorization from the FDA for collection of human fecal samples and the stabilization of DNA from the bacterial community for subsequent assessment of the microbiome profile by an assay validated for use with OMNIgene®·GUT Dx device.

One of our customers accounted for approximately 58% of our net consolidated revenues in 2022. We had no customers that accounted for more than 10% of our net consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
 
Supply and Manufacturing

We manufacture all of our OraQuick ADVANCE® Rapid HIV test, OraQuick® In-Home HIV test, OraQuick® HCV test, OraQuick® Ebola test, OraSure®, Intercept® and Intercept i2® he collection devices, AUTO-LYTE® and MICRO-PLATE assays and Q.E.D.® saliva alcohol test in our Bethlehem, Pennsylvania facilities. We expect to continue to manufacture these products at this location for the foreseeable future.


We have contracted with a third party in Thailand for the assembly of the OraQuick® Rapid HIV test and the OraQuick® HIV In-Home Test in order to supply certain international markets. We believe that other firms would be able to assemble these OraQuick® tests on terms no less favorable than those set forth in the agreement if the Thailand contractor would be unable or unwilling to continue assembling this product. We have long-term agreements in place for the contract manufacturing in Thailand and one of our suppliers has been manufacturing for us for the past 20 years.
 
We can purchase the HIV antigens, the nitrocellulose and certain other critical components, and the HCV and Ebola antigens used in our OraQuick® product lines only from a limited number of sources. If for any reason these suppliers are unwilling or no longer able to supply our antigen or nitrocellulose needs, we believe that alternative supplies could be obtained at a competitive cost. However, a change in any of the antigens, the nitrocellulose or other critical components used in our products would require FDA approval and some additional development work. This in turn could require significant time to complete, increase our costs and disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell the affected products.

We manufacture all of the proprietary chemistry and assay cards for our InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Tests in our Bethlehem, Pennsylvania facilities. We significantly scaled up manufacturing capacity in the United States for our InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Tests and have achieved manufacturing capacity targets under our 2021 contract with the US DOD, in coordination with HHS. Funding under the contract has been, and will be, paid to us based on achievement of milestones through March 2024 for the design, acquisition, installation, qualification and acceptance of the manufacturing equipment. An existing Company location in Bethlehem, PA has been retrofitted to accommodate increased manufacturing capacity.

Our MICRO-PLATE and AUTO-LYTE® assays require the production of highly specific and sensitive antibodies corresponding to the antigen of interest. Substantially all our antibody requirements are provided by contract suppliers. We believe that we have adequate reserves of antibody supplies and that we have access to sufficient raw materials for these products.

The fully-automated high-throughput oral fluid drug assays sold with our new Intercept i2®he collection device are manufactured and supplied under a long-term agreement with Thermo Fisher. There is no other supply source for these products.
 
DNAG has three long-term contract manufacturing relationships to supply virtually all of its products, including the Oragene® product line. Many of the raw materials and components used in these products are also purchased from third parties, some of which are purchased from a single source supplier. We are actively seeking to qualify other suppliers that can manufacture and supply the raw materials and components for the DNAG products. All DNAG products in our Molecular Solutions business are produced in Canada.

Our Colli-Pee® device is currently manufactured at our Belgian assembly facility with components supplied by third party vendors.
 
Our genomic, microbiome and metatranscriptomics laboratory testing and analytical services are provided by our subsidiary, Diversigen.
 
Human Capital Resources

In order to achieve the goals and expectations of our Company, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make OraSure a safe and rewarding workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 840 full-time employees, which compares to 785 employees as of December 31, 2021. The increase in employees during 2022 was primarily the result of the need to add manufacturing capacity for our InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test. In February 2023, we announced an 11% reduction in our non-production workforce. Our employees are not currently represented by a U.S. collective bargaining agreement.
 
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention to attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Management also reviews employee engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues.
 
The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. We safeguard our people, projects and reputation by striving for zero employee injuries and illnesses, while operating and delivering our work responsibly and sustainably. We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. Personal protective equipment is provided to those employees where needed for the employee to safely perform their job function.
 

As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to healthy base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, a Company matched 401(k) Plan or other savings plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs.
 
The OraSure family of companies is committed to creating and fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace that reflects and contributes to the global communities in which we do business and the customers and partners we serve. This includes all communities impacted by our corporate presence. Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a Code of Conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination. We strive to recruit the best people for the job regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected trait and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws (domestic and foreign) applicable to discrimination in the workplace. We have an active Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council that strives to drive diversity, equity and inclusion within the workplace. At OraSure, we believe a variety of perspectives are critical to achieving success, and that diversity, equity and inclusion are key drivers to growth-based innovation and profitability. We aim to create a culture where all people feel valued, supported, and inspired to be themselves fearlessly, without judgment. We believe that when all voices are heard, we honor and exemplify our core values and best serve our communities.
 
 2022 Developments

On March 31, 2022, the termination of Dr. Tang as President and Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") of the Company became effective. Dr. Nancy Gagliano served as interim CEO for a period commencing on April 1, 2022 and ending on June 4, 2022, at which time Carrie Eglinton Manner was appointed as President and CEO.

On June 9, 2022, we announced the termination of Agnieszka Gallagher's employment with the Company as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer.

On August 8, 2022 our Board of Directors appointed Ken McGrath as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. McGrath replaced Interim Chief Financial Officer, Scott Gleason.

On November 7, 2022 our Board of Directors promoted Kathleen Weber from President, Molecular Solutions to Chief Product Officer.
 
Competition

Diagnostics
 
The diagnostic industry is a multi-billion dollar international industry and is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, and have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We have many rapid tests with proprietary features enabling them to compete effectively in select market segments. Broadly, we differentiate based on our tests’ ease of use, which has enabled us to expand our self-testing offering.
 
The primary competitive factors for our products include price, quality, performance, ease of use, customer service and reputation. Industry competition is based on these and the following additional factors:
•Scientific and technological capability; 
 •Proprietary know-how; 
 •The ability to develop and market products and processes; 
 •The ability to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals; 
 •The ability to manufacture products that meet applicable FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements; 
 •Commercial execution and strength of distribution; 
 •Access to adequate capital; 
 •The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and 
 •The availability of patent protection. 
 

A few large corporations produce a wide variety of diagnostic tests and other medical devices and equipment. A larger number of mid-size companies generally compete only in the diagnostic industry and a significant number of small companies produce only a few diagnostic products. As a result, the diagnostic test industry is highly fragmented and segmented. This enables us to serve specific segments where the products provide a unique benefit.
 
The future market for diagnostic products is expected to be characterized by greater cost consciousness, the development of new technologies, tighter reimbursement policies and consolidation. The purchasers of diagnostic products are expected to place increased emphasis on lowering costs, reducing inventory levels, obtaining better performing products, automation, service and volume discounts.
 
We expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made and become more widely known, and as new products reach the market. Furthermore, new testing methodologies could be developed in the future that render our products impractical, uneconomical or obsolete. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that would render our technologies and products obsolete or otherwise commercially unattractive. In addition, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for these products, or introduce or commercialize them, before we can do so. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Competition in the U.S. market for infectious disease testing in medical settings is intense and is expected to increase. Our principal competition for HIV testing in the professional market comes from existing and new professional point-of-care rapid blood tests and automated laboratory-based blood tests. Our OraQuick ADVANCE® rapid HIV test is the only OTC oral fluid test for HIV in the United States, and as such, enables outreach testing outside of clinics. Our OraQuick® rapid HCV test competes against laboratory-based blood tests in the U.S., as there currently are no other rapid HCV testing products approved by the FDA.

Our OraQuick® In-Home HIV oral fluid test is the only rapid HIV test approved by the FDA for sale in the US OTC market.

Outside the U.S., our rapid HIV and HCV tests compete against other rapid and laboratory-based tests, which require blood as a sample. The majority of these blood-based tests are priced at or below our HIV and HCV rapid oral fluid tests. There are no other oral fluid tests for HCV outside the US with WHO Prequalification status and the CE mark. The majority of our sales outside the US are in Africa due to the greater incidence of HIV in that region. Our OraQuick® HIV Self-Test is CE marked, which enables us to participate in the European OTC market for HIV.

The United States COVID-19 rapid testing market consists of tests used by medical professionals at the point-of-care as well as OTC tests purchased and used by consumers. There are numerous professional point-of-care tests, OTC Antigen rapid tests and OTC rapid molecular tests authorized under EUA by the FDA. Our InteliSwab® test competes in both the professional point-of-care and OTC segments with these products.

In the substance abuse testing market, our Intercept® drug testing system competes with laboratory-based drug testing products using sample matrices such as urine, hair, sweat and oral fluid. We expect competition for our products to intensify, particularly from other domestic and international companies that have developed, or may develop, competing oral fluid drug testing products.

Our MICRO-PLATE oral fluid drug assays, which are sold for use with the original Intercept® collector and our OraSure® collection device, also continue to come under increasing competitive pressure from “home-brew” assays developed internally by our laboratory customers. Our oral fluid MICRO-PLATE assays also compete with urine-based homogeneous assays that are run on fully-automated, random access analyzers.

Our MICRO-PLATE drugs-of-abuse reagents sold in the forensic toxicology market are targeted to forensic testing laboratories where sensitivity, automation and “system solutions” are important. We compete with both homogeneous and heterogeneous tests manufactured by many companies.

Q.E.D.® competes against other semi-quantitative saliva-based alcohol tests that have received U.S. Department of Transportation approval as well as breath alcohol tests. Although there are lower priced tests on the market that use oral fluid or breath as a test medium, we believe that these tests are qualitative tests that we believe are lower in quality and provide fewer benefits than our Q.E.D.® test.

Molecular Solutions
 
Our Oragene® and ORAcollect® collection systems compete against other types of collection devices used for molecular testing, such as blood collection devices and buccal swabs, which often are sold for prices lower than the prices charged for the Oragene® and ORAcollect® products. Although we believe the Oragene® and ORAcollect® devices offer a number of advantages over these other products, the availability of lower price competitive devices can result in lost sales and degradation in pricing and profit margin. Our

Oragene® and ORAcollect® products are also facing increasing competition from similarly designed collection systems which are beginning to enter the market. With the receipt of authorizations for use in connection with COVID-19 molecular tests, our Oragene® and ORAcollect® products now compete against COVID-19 testing systems and the collection methods used in those systems.

OMNIgene® GUT is being sold in the emerging microbiome market and competes with a variety of non-standard in-house solutions developed by various researchers, including simply freezing the sample after collection. The microbiome market is expected to require standardization in the methods used for collection and stabilization in order to derive more accurate and repeatable results. To date, we are one of the few vendors to offer a solution that fully meets these requirements.

Our genomic, microbiome and metatranscriptomics laboratory service offerings primarily compete against a number of commercial reference laboratories, specialty laboratories and hospital laboratories in the U.S.

Patents and Proprietary Information

We seek patents and other intellectual property rights to protect and preserve our proprietary technology and our right to capitalize on the results of our research and development activities. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to provide competitive advantages for our products in our markets and to accelerate new product introductions. We regularly search for third-party patents in fields related to our business to shape our own patent and product commercialization strategies as effectively as possible and to identify licensing opportunities. United States patents generally have a maximum term of 20 years from the date an application is filed.

We have patents throughout our product and service lines. Our patent portfolio includes pending applications and issued patents in diagnostics and testing, sampling tools, and services and analysis. Our portfolio protects our innovative sampling tools, services and diagnostics that provide access to accurate, essential information that advances global health and well-being.

Diagnostics and testing products include the OraSure® and Intercept® collection devices that are covered by one utility and one design patent in each of the U.S., Canada, Japan, and throughout Europe. We have numerous foreign patents for its collection devices and technology relating to oral fluid collection, containers for oral fluids, methods to test oral fluids, and methods to control the volume of oral fluids collected and dispersed. The utility patents will expire in January 2028, and the design patents will expire in 2025.
 
Sampling tools are the subject of several other patents and pending applications, including U.S. and international utility patent applications directed to a new oral fluid collection device. The international applications will enter their national phase in countries throughout the world beginning in October 2023. Patents issuing from these applications will expire in March 2041.
 
We have a U.S. and international PCT patent applications that are directed to a new developer solution vial for use with sampling and assay devices. The international application and will enter its national phase in countries throughout the world, beginning in May 2023 and patents issuing from these applications will expire in December 2041. Related design patent applications are pending in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
 
We have additional pending applications directed to new direct sample collection pads for our InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test. These applications will enter their national phase in countries throughout the world, beginning in October 2023, and patents issuing from these applications will expire in December 2042. A related design patent issued in 2022 in the U.S. and corresponding design applications were registered in Canada, China, India, and Europe. These design patents will expire 2035.

We have registered design patents for a collection funnel and corresponding plunger device in Europe, China, and India and a corresponding U.S. design patent application is pending.
 
We have pending patent applications throughout our product and service lines directed to assays, methods, devices, and reagents for monitoring adherence to HIV medications, such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in PrEP regimens.

We have two international families of patent applications filed in the United States and in numerous countries worldwide. These applications are directed to novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-specific antibodies for use in assays to detect the presence of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug derivatives, including tenofovir, in fluid samples. Patents issuing from these applications will expire in October 2038 and December 2040.
 
We hold, through our subsidiary, DNAG, thirty granted United States patents and numerous foreign patents issued for compositions, methods and apparatuses for the collection, stabilization, transportation, and storage of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from oral fluid and other bodily fluids and tissues. These patents expire from June 2023 through October 2037.
 

We hold through our subsidiary, Novosanis, one granted United States patent and numerous foreign patents covering a medical device for capturing a predetermined volume of first void urine. This patent expires in September 2033. We have also applied for additional patents, in both the United States and certain foreign countries, in novel urine collection devices.
 
Our subsidiary, Diversigen, has licensed one United States patent and several foreign patent applications from the University of Minnesota for analytical standards to detect and/or measure sampling, processing, and/or amplification errors in a biological sample containing polynucleotide molecules. These patents will expire in May 2036. This license also covers certain software and know-how related to laboratory and bioinformatics procedures and processes. Diversigen has also licensed certain know-how and database assets from the Baylor College of Medicine related to laboratory processes for microbiome and metagenomics services.
 
We require our employees, consultants, outside collaborators and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and certain consultants, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual during his or her tenure with us or the performance by the consultant of services for us will be our exclusive property.

We own rights to trademarks and service marks that we believe are necessary to conduct our business as currently operated. In the United States, we own a number of trademarks, including the OraSure®, Intercept®, Intercept i2®he, OraQuick®, OraQuick ADVANCE®, OraSure QuickFlu®, Q.E.D.®, InteliSwab®, Oragene®, DNA Genotek®, OMNImetTM, ORAcollect®, OMNIgene®, goDNATM, Diversigen®, CoreBiome®, Boostershot®, MetaGeneTM, BenchmarkTM, Novosanis®, Colli-Pee®, UCM®, UASTM, AUTO-LYTE®, prepIT®, and Hemagene® trademarks. We also own many of these marks and others in several foreign countries and we are pursuing registration of several other trademarks.

Although important, the issuance of a patent or existence of trademark or trade secret protection does not in itself ensure the success of our business. Competitors may be able to produce products competing with our patented products without infringing our patent rights. Issuance of a patent in one country generally does not prevent manufacture or sale of the patented product in other countries. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to validity or as to the enforceable scope of the patent. The validity or enforceability of a patent or trademark can be challenged by litigation after its issuance or registration. If the outcome of such litigation is adverse to the owner of the patent, the owner’s rights could be diminished or withdrawn. Trade secret protection does not prevent independent discovery and exploitation of the secret product or technique.

Government Regulation

General
 
Most of our products are regulated by the FDA, along with other federal, state and local agencies and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries. This regulated environment governs almost all aspects of development, production and marketing, including product design and testing, authorizations to market, labeling, advertising and promotion, manufacturing, distribution, post-market surveillance and reporting, and recordkeeping. We believe that our products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable regulations, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products may be unclear and are subject to change. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Many of our FDA-regulated products require some form of review and action by the FDA before they can be marketed in the United States. After approval or clearance by the FDA, we must continue to comply with other FDA requirements applicable to marketed products and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Both before and after approval or clearance, failure to comply with the FDA’s requirements can lead to significant penalties or could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell these products. In addition, the FDA could refuse permission to obtain certificates needed to export our products if the agency determines that we are not in compliance.
 
Domestic Regulation

Most of our products are regulated in the United States as in vitro diagnostic and medical devices. In the United States, devices are classified into three groups based on risk: class I (lowest risk), class II (moderate risk), and class III (highest risk). The classification of a device determines the level of regulation applicable to the device: class I devices are subject only to the general controls that are applicable to all regulated devices; class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls, which are specific to the type of device; and class III devices are subject to general controls and any other controls that are needed to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the specific device.


The classification of the device also influences the type of premarket submission that is required before the device can be marketed. Some low risk devices (including many class I and some class II devices) may be placed on the market without any premarket submission. Such devices often are referred to as “exempt” or “510(k)-exempt.” Most devices, however, require some form of premarket submission prior to marketing. There are several mechanisms by which such devices can be placed on the market in the United States, including 510(k)-clearance, de novo classification, premarket approval, or EUA.

Many class II devices and some class I devices may qualify for clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"). To obtain this clearance from the FDA, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing the product, and show that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed predicate device (i.e., a device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process; a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976; a device that has been reclassified by the FDA; or a device that the FDA previously has determined to be exempt from the 510(k) process). To be substantially equivalent, an applicant must show that when compared to a predicate, the new device has the same intended use and same technology, or if different technology, that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. In all cases, data from some form of performance testing is required and in some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies. An applicant must submit a 510(k) notification at least 90 days before commercial distribution of the product commences. Marketing may only commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device. The standards and data requirements necessary for the clearance of a new device may be unclear or may be subject to change. Although FDA clearance usually takes from four to twelve months, in some cases more than a year may be required before clearance is obtained, if at all.

If the device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure, either because there is no existing predicate device, it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device or because it is classified by the FDA as a class III device, the FDA must approve either a PMA application or for devices that are low to moderate risk, grant a request for de novo classification before marketing can begin. A de novo classification is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk for which no substantially equivalent predicate device exists into class I or class II. The FDA’s goal is to decide a de novo request in 150 days from the time the request is received, although it can take longer.

PMAs generally are required for class III devices, i.e., high risk devices, and must demonstrate, among other matters, that the medical device provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use(s) of the device. A PMA is typically a complex submission, supported by valid scientific evidence, including the results of preclinical and clinical studies, usability data, detailed information about the manufacturing process for the device, and other data and information. Preparing a PMA is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Once a PMA has been submitted, the FDA is required to review the submission within 180 days. However, the FDA’s review may be, and often is, much longer, in many cases requiring one to three years or more, and may include requests for additional data, review by an independent panel of experts, and facility inspections before approval is granted, if at all.

If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years or prevent a PMA approval from being obtained.

If the FDA discovers that an applicant has submitted false or misleading information in any application or notification, the FDA may take action against the applicant and its employees or refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to its Application Integrity Policy. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Another option for marketing a product in the U.S. is through an EUA. FDA may grant an EUA for a product if the Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of certain products. Such declaration may be made following a determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that there is a public health emergency, by the Secretary of Homeland Security that there is a domestic emergency, or by the Secretary of Defense that there is a military emergency, or the declaration may be made if a material threat is identified under a particular provision of the Public Health Service Act. Typically, a diagnostic device may receive EUA-authorization on the basis of analytical and clinical studies that do not satisfy the requirements for full clearance or approval. Devices also may be exempt from design controls and other quality requirements. An EUA for a device remains in effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, determines that the circumstances justifying emergency use of the device no longer exist, or until the authorized device is approved or cleared.
 
If there are any modifications made to our marketed devices, a new premarket notification, PMA supplement, or request to change an EUA may be required to be submitted to, and cleared, approved, or authorized by, the FDA, before the modified device may be marketed.

A new PMA or a PMA supplement is required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s intended use(s), manufacturing process, manufacturing facility, critical components, labeling and design. Likewise, a new 510(k) clearance is required for any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, e.g. a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source, or manufacturing process or a major change or modification in the intended use(s) of the device.

A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a de novo request or PMA application. These trials generally require an approved application for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) and compliance with other IDE requirements, unless the proposed study is deemed to be exempt from the IDE requirements. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory testing results, protocols for the proposed investigation, and other information demonstrating that the device is appropriate for use with humans in a clinical study. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trial(s) support the ultimate approval or clearance of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA’s regulations, including the requirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject, and with clinical trial reporting regulations that require submission of information on certain clinical trials to a database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product in the United States. If a study meets the requirements for a non-significant risk study, however, it may be eligible for compliance with “abbreviated” IDE requirements, which include a subset of the requirements applicable to significant risk medical device studies. A non-significant risk study also will be considered to have an approved IDE application without such application actually being submitted to FDA.
 
Some of our products are used for research only or for other nonclinical or non-diagnostic purposes. Our molecular collection products are sold to many academic and research institutions for research purposes and our drugs-of-abuse products are sold to laboratories and clinics for forensic or other non-medical uses. The FDA does not currently regulate products used for these purposes, although other state and federal regulatory requirements may apply.

Most devices distributed in the United States must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”), including current good manufacturing practices. These regulations govern the entire life cycle of a medical device, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation and purchasing as well as complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions, and internal auditing. In complying with the QSRs, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality, and post-market surveillance to ensure full compliance.

Companies that market devices are also subject to other post-market and general requirements, including product listing and establishment regulations, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action, post-market surveillance requests, restrictions imposed on marketed products, promotional standards and requirements for recordkeeping and reporting of certain adverse reactions and device malfunctions. Device reporting regulations require that manufacturers report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur.

The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA’s regulations can result in an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusion of an inspection when an investigator has observed any conditions that may constitute violations), public warning letters, monetary penalties against a company or its officers and employees, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, injunctions, product recalls, product detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the FDA’s OSR regulations and other post-market requirements, but the regulations are subject to change or may be unclear, and we cannot be sure that FDA investigators will agree with our compliance with the FDA’s post-market requirements.

CLIA prohibits any facility that conducts laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans from providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of, the health of human beings, unless there is in effect for such facility a certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or an accredited organization, and such certificate is applicable to the category of examination or procedure performed. Tests may be categorized as “waived,” enabling them to be used by laboratories with the lowest level of CLIA oversight if the tests meet certain requirements established under CLIA. We consider the applicability of CLIA requirements in the design and development of our products. We have obtained a waiver of the CLIA requirements for our OraQuick ADVANCE® rapid HIV-1/2 antibody test, our OraQuick® HCV rapid antibody test and our Q.E.D.® alcohol saliva test and may seek similar waivers for certain other products. In addition, the supplier of the OraSure Quick-Flu® test has

obtained a CLIA waiver for that product. The InteliSwab® COVID-19 Rapid Test Pro is authorized for use in patient care settings operating under CLIA Certificate, Certificate of Compliance and Certificate of Accreditation.
 
The laboratory services provided by our subsidiary, Diversigen, consist of microbiome, metatranscriptomics and metagenomics sequencing, bioinformatics and analysis. Diversigen has elected to obtain a license from CLIA and has received a certificate of accreditation from the College of American Pathologists (CAP).
 
Certain of our products may also be affected by state regulations in the United States, which can restrict the use and sale of certain diagnostic products.
 
Advertising and Promotion

Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by other federal and state regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and various state attorneys general. Although physicians are permitted to exercise medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we may not promote our products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have also been the subject of enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. Federal Trade Commission enforcement actions often result in consent decrees that constrain future actions. Department of Justice prosecutions can result in significant criminal and civil penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If an enforcement action is brought by the FDA or Federal Trade Commission, our reputation could be damaged and sales of our products could be impaired.
Import and Export Requirements

Products for export from the United States are subject to foreign countries’ import requirements and the exporting requirements of the FDA, as applicable. In particular, international sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements.
 
Foreign countries often require, among other things, an FDA certificate for products for export, also called a Certificate for Foreign Government (“CFG”). To obtain this certificate from the FDA, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with QSR regulations at the time of the last FDA inspection. If the FDA determines that our facilities or procedures do not comply with the QSR regulations, it may refuse to provide such certificates until we resolve the issues to the FDA’s satisfaction. Failure to obtain a CFG could inhibit our ability to export our products to countries that require such certificates.

International

We are also subject to regulations in foreign countries governing products, human clinical trials and marketing, and may need to obtain approval (or pre-qualification or endorsement) from local regulators in such countries or international public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, in order to sell products in certain countries. Approval processes vary from country to country, and the length of time required for approval or to obtain other clearances may in some cases be longer than that required for U.S. governmental approvals. We generally pursue approval only in those countries that we believe have a significant market opportunity.

The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies. ISO 13485 certification indicates that our quality system complies with standards applicable to activities ranging from initial product design and development through production and distribution.

The European Union (“EU”) adopted the EU Medical Devices Regulation (the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which repealed and replaced the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (“IVDD”), respectively. The EU MDR and EU IVDR impose stricter pre-market and post-market requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU IVDR became applicable on May 26, 2022. There is a transitional period during which products that have a declaration of conformity issued under the IVDD prior to May 26, 2022 may continue to be

placed on the EU market for a certain period before requiring certification under the IVDR; however, class A non-sterile products do not benefit from such transitional provisions and have been required to be IVDR compliant since May 26, 2022.

In the EU, products that fall under the scope of the MDR and the IVDR are not subject to the prior approval of a regulatory authority, but, depending on the class of product, may require prior review by a notified body. Notified bodies are accredited and supervised by national regulatory authorities to conduct conformity assessment procedures of medical devices or other products. Such products must comply with certain essential requirements listed in those directives. ISO certification creates a rebuttable presumption that the product satisfies the applicable requirements. Compliance with these requirements allows us to complete the applicable conformity assessment procedure, involving a notified body where necessary, and to affix the CE mark to our products, without which they may not be placed on the market in the EU. We also note that from January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom (“UK”) has introduced a UK-specific route to market for medical devices. Compliance with these requirements may add further complexities to our international strategy.
 
We must also comply with certain registration and licensing requirements as dictated by Health Canada, prior to commencing sales in Canada. We have completed this process for several of our current products and may do so with respect to other products in the future. In addition, Canadian law requires manufacturers of medical devices to have a quality management system that meets various ISO requirements in order to obtain a license to sell their devices in Canada. Health Canada also requires all companies that market Class II, Class III and Class IV products in Canada to be certified as part of the Medical Device Single Audit Program ("MDSAP"). We received this certification for our Diagnostics segment (previously named "OSUR") in January 2019 as well as for our Molecular Business Unit in February 2020.
 
We have obtained WHO pre-qualification for our OraQuick® HIV-1/Antibody Test, OraQuick® HIV Self-Test and OraQuick® HCV.

Anti-Kickback and Other Fraud and Abuse Laws

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce:
•The referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs; or 
 •The purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental healthcare programs. 
 
Our products are or may be purchased by customers that will seek or receive reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs. Noncompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs, and/or restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, including Medicaid and Medicare. A violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is considered a violation of the FCA. Some suits filed under the FCA, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by a “whistleblower” or “relator” on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit.
 
The Beneficiary Inducement provisions of the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Federal healthcare programs.

Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions and significant damage to our reputation.

We are also subject to other federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including marketing conduct laws, transparency laws, and laws that require us to adopt a compliance program. Taken together, these fraud and abuse laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, such manufacturers can enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws and regulations are

wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application. In recent years, there has been greater scrutiny of marketing practices in the medical device industry which has resulted in several government investigations by various government authorities and the introduction and/or passage of federal and state legislation regulating interactions between medical device manufacturers and healthcare professionals and providers and requiring the disclosure by medical device manufacturers of payments to certain healthcare providers. For example, under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act, device manufacturers are subject to federal reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to U.S. physicians, certain other licensed health care practitioners, and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under the Sunshine Act are placed in a public database. Device manufacturers are required to submit annual reports by March 31 which cover the prior calendar year. To be in compliance with such disclosure laws, we have implemented necessary systems to accurately track gifts and other payments.

We have implemented a written Policy on Interactions with Health Care Professionals, which is based on the Code of Ethics for Interactions with Health Care Professionals promulgated by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, (the "AdvaMed"), a leading trade association representing medical device manufacturers. The Policy applies to all employees and is intended to comply with applicable state and federal laws, regulations and government guidance. The Policy addresses interactions related to sales and marketing practices, research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. While we believe that our practices are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback and other fraud and abuse laws, the standards for compliance with such statutes can be unclear and subject to change.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in bribery and corruption when dealing with foreign government officials and foreign political parties. It is illegal to corruptly offer, pay, promise, or authorize the giving of anything of value to any officer or employee of a foreign government or public international organization, political party, political party official, or political candidate, in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise improperly influence a person working in an official capacity on behalf of a foreign government or public international organization. Our present and future business has and will continue to be subject to the FCPA and various other laws, rules and/or regulations applicable to us as a result of our international sales. We also are subject to the FCPA’s accounting provisions, which require us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to assure management’s control, authority, and responsibility over the company's assets. The failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could result in civil or criminal sanctions or other adverse consequences.

The laws to which we are subject as a result of our international sales also include the U.K. Bribery Act (the “Bribery Act”), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.

Environmental Regulation

Because of the nature of our current and proposed research, development, and manufacturing processes, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge and handling and disposal of solid wastes, hazardous materials and hazardous wastes. Products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in EU markets under the Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”). RoHS prohibits companies from selling electrical and electronic equipment, such as electronic medical devices, that contain certain hazardous materials, including lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, in the EU Member States. In addition, the EU’s Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) imposes severe restrictions and requirements on companies marketing devices in the EU. Among other things, REACH requires companies to obtain prior authorization to use substances of very high concern that are listed for authorization, and imposes bans on the marketing of products that contain specifically listed hazardous substances. Companies marketing medical devices in the EU may also be subject to expensive waste take back obligations under the EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Directive, the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, and the Batteries Directive.

Future environmental laws, rules, regulations or policies may require us to alter our manufacturing processes, thereby increasing our manufacturing costs, or may impose other additional obligations on us or our products. We believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws; however, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated.
 
The foregoing discussion of our business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report.
