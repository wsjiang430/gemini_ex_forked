Item 1. Business
Organization and Overview
RPC is a Delaware corporation originally organized in 1984 as a holding company for several oilfield services companies and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
RPC provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services and equipment primarily to independent and major oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international markets. RPC acts as a holding company for the following legal entity groupings: Cudd Energy Services, Cudd Pressure Control, Thru Tubing Solutions and Patterson Services. Selected overhead including centralized support services and regulatory compliance are classified as Corporate. RPC is further organized into Technical Services and Support Services which are its operating segments. As of December 31, 2022, RPC had 2,732 employees.

Business Segments
RPC manages its business as either services offered on the well site with equipment and personnel (Technical Services) or services and equipment offered off the well site (Support Services). The businesses under Technical Services generate revenues based on equipment, personnel operating the equipment and the materials utilized to provide the service. They are all managed, analyzed and reported based on the similarities of the operational characteristics and costs associated with providing the service. The businesses under Support Services are primarily able to generate revenues through equipment or services offered off the well site. During 2022, approximately five percent of RPC’s consolidated revenues were generated from offshore operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In 2022, we also estimate that 77 percent of our revenues were related to drilling and production activities for oil, while 23 percent of revenues were related to drilling and production activities for natural gas.
Technical Services include RPC’s oil and gas services that utilize people and equipment to perform value-added completion, production and maintenance services directly to a customer’s well. The demand for these services is generally influenced by customers’ decisions to invest capital toward initiating production in a new oil or natural gas well, improving production flows in an existing formation, or to address well control issues. This operating segment consists primarily of pressure pumping, downhole tools, coiled tubing, snubbing, nitrogen, well control, wireline and fishing. Customers include major multi-national and independent oil and gas producers, and selected nationally owned oil companies. The services offered under Technical Services are high capital and personnel intensive businesses. The common drivers of operational and financial success of these services include diligent equipment maintenance, strong logistical processes, and appropriately trained personnel who function well in a team environment. The Company considers all of these services to be closely integrated oil and gas well servicing businesses, and makes resource allocation and performance assessment decisions based on this operating segment as a whole across these various services. The principal markets for this business segment include the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and selected international markets.
Support Services include all of the services that provide (i) equipment offered off the well site without RPC personnel and (ii) services that are provided in support of customer operations off the well site such as classroom and computer training. The primary drivers of operational success for services and equipment provided off the well site without RPC personnel are offering safe, high quality and in-demand equipment appropriate for the well design characteristics. The drivers of operational success for the other Support Services relate to meeting customer needs off the well site and competitive marketing of such services. The equipment and 




​

services offered include rental tools, drill pipe and related tools, pipe handling, pipe inspection and storage services, and oilfield training services. The demand for these services tends to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. The principal markets for this segment include the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions and project work in selected international locations. Customers primarily include domestic operations of independent oil and gas producers and major multi-nationals and selected nationally owned oil companies.
A brief description of the primary services conducted within each of the operating segments follows:
Technical Services
Pressure Pumping. Pressure pumping services, which accounted for 53 percent of 2022 revenues, 43 percent of 2021 revenues and 37 percent of 2020 revenues are provided to customers throughout Texas, and the mid-continent regions of the United States. We primarily provide these services to customers to enhance the initial production of hydrocarbons in formations that have low permeability. Pressure pumping services involve using complex, truck or skid-mounted equipment designed and constructed for each specific pumping service offered. The mobility of this equipment permits pressure pumping services to be performed in varying geographic areas. Principal materials utilized in pressure pumping operations include fracturing proppants, acid and bulk chemical additives. Generally, these items are available from several suppliers, and the Company utilizes more than one supplier for each item. Pressure pumping services offered include:
Fracturing — Fracturing services are performed to stimulate production of oil and natural gas by increasing the permeability of a formation. Fracturing is particularly important in shale formations, which have low permeability, and unconventional completion, because the formation containing hydrocarbons is not concentrated in one area and requires multiple fracturing operations. The fracturing process consists of pumping fluids and sometimes nitrogen into a cased well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation at desired locations and depths. Sand, ceramics, or synthetic materials, which are often coated with a material to increase their resistance to crushing, are pumped into the fracture. When the pressure is released at the surface, the fluid returns to the well surface, but the proppant remains in the fracture, thus keeping it open to allow oil and natural gas to flow through the fracture into the production tubing and ultimately to the well surface. In some cases, fracturing is performed in formations with a high amount of carbonate rock by an acid solution pumped under pressure without a proppant or with small amounts of proppant.
Acidizing — Acidizing services are also performed to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, but they are used in wells that have undergone formation damage due to the buildup of various materials that block the formation. Acidizing entails pumping large volumes of specially formulated acids into reservoirs to dissolve barriers and enlarge crevices in the formation, thereby eliminating obstacles to the flow of oil and natural gas. Acidizing services can also enhance production in limestone formations. Acid is also frequently used in the beginning of a fracturing operation.
Cementing — Cementing services are used at the completion stage of an oil or natural gas well to seal the wellbore after the casing string has been run. The process of cementing includes developing a cement slurry formulated for a well’s unique characteristics, pumping the cement through the wellbore and into the space between the well casing and well bore, and allowing it to harden. In addition to completion uses, cementing can also be used to seal a lost circulation zone in an existing well, and to plug a well at the end of its life cycle.
Downhole Tools. Thru Tubing Solutions’ (“TTS”) downhole tools division accounted for 23 percent of revenues in 2022, 29 percent of revenues in 2021 and 33 percent of 2020 revenues. TTS provides services and proprietary downhole motors, fishing tools and other specialized downhole tools and processes to operators and service companies in drilling and production operations, including casing perforation and bridge plug drilling at the completion stage of an oil or gas well. The services that TTS provides are especially suited for unconventional drilling and completion activities. TTS’ experience providing reliable tool services allows it to work in a pressurized environment with virtually any coiled tubing unit or snubbing unit.
Coiled Tubing. Coiled tubing services, which accounted for nine percent of revenues in 2022, ten percent of revenues in 2021 and nine percent of revenues in 2020, involve the injection of coiled tubing into wells to perform various applications and functions for use principally in well-servicing operations and to facilitate completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of less than four inches manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet and wound or coiled around a large reel. It can be inserted through existing production tubing and used to perform workovers without using a larger, costlier workover rig. Principal advantages of employing coiled tubing in a workover operation include: (i) not having to “shut-in” the well during such operations, (ii) the ability to reel continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe, (iii) the ability to direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, and (iv) enhanced access to remote or offshore fields due to the smaller size and mobility of a coiled tubing unit compared to a workover rig. Coiled tubing units are also used to support completion activities in directional and horizontal wells. Such completion activities usually require multiple entrances in a wellbore to complete multiple fractures during a pressure pumping operation. A coiled tubing unit can accomplish this type of operation because its flexibility allows 




​

it to be steered in a direction other than vertical, which is necessary in this type of wellbore. At the same time, the strength of the coiled tubing string allows various types of tools or motors to be conveyed into the well effectively. The uses for coiled tubing in directional and horizontal wells have been enhanced by improved fabrication techniques and higher-diameter coiled tubing which allows coiled tubing units to be used effectively over greater distances, thus allowing them to function in more of the completion activities currently taking place in the U.S. domestic market. There are several manufacturers of flexible steel pipe used in coiled tubing, and the Company believes that its sources of supply are adequate.
Snubbing. Snubbing (also referred to as hydraulic workover services), which accounted for two percent of revenues in both 2022 and 2021 and one percent of revenues in 2020, involves using a hydraulic workover rig that permits an operator to repair damaged casing, production tubing and downhole production equipment in a high-pressure environment. A snubbing unit makes it possible to remove and replace downhole equipment while maintaining pressure on the well. Customers benefit because these operations can be performed without removing the pressure from the well, which stops production and can damage the formation, and because a snubbing unit can perform many applications at a lower cost than other alternatives. Because the well being serviced by a hydraulic workover unit is often under pressure, which is hazardous by nature, the snubbing segment of the oil and gas services industry is limited to relatively few operators who have the experience and knowledge required to perform such services safely. Increasingly, snubbing units are used for unconventional completions at the outer reaches of long wellbores which cannot be serviced by coiled tubing because coiled tubing has a more limited range than drill pipe conveyed by a snubbing unit.
Nitrogen. Nitrogen accounted for two percent of revenues in 2022, four percent of revenues in 2021 and five percent of revenues in 2020. There are a number of uses for nitrogen, an inert, non-combustible element, in providing services to oilfield customers and industrial users outside of the oilfield. For our oilfield customers, nitrogen can be used to clean drilling and production pipe and displace fluids in various drilling applications. Increasingly, it is used as a displacement medium to increase production in older wells in which production has depleted. It also can be used to create a fire-retardant environment in hazardous blowout situations and as a fracturing medium for our fracturing service. In addition, nitrogen can be complementary to our snubbing and coiled tubing services, because it is a non-corrosive medium and is frequently injected into a well using coiled tubing. Nitrogen is complementary to our pressure pumping service as well, because foam-based nitrogen stimulation is appropriate in certain sensitive formations in which the fluids used in fracturing or acidizing would damage a customer's well. 
 For non-oilfield industrial users, nitrogen can be used to purge pipelines and create a non-combustible environment. RPC stores and transports nitrogen and has a number of pumping unit configurations that inject nitrogen in its various applications. Some of these pumping units are set up for use on offshore platforms or inland waters. RPC purchases its nitrogen in liquid form from several suppliers and believes that these sources of supply are adequate.
Well Control. Cudd Pressure Control specializes in responding to and controlling oil and gas well emergencies, including blowouts and well fires, domestically and internationally. In connection with these services, Cudd Pressure Control, along with Patterson Services, has the capacity to supply the equipment, expertise and personnel necessary to restore affected oil and gas wells to production. During the past several years, the Company has responded to numerous well control situations in the domestic U.S. oilfield and in various international locations.
The Company’s professional firefighting staff has many years of aggregate industry experience in responding to well fires and blowouts. This team of experts responds to well control situations where hydrocarbons are escaping from a wellbore, regardless of whether a fire has occurred. In the most critical situations, there are explosive fires, the destruction of drilling and production facilities, substantial environmental damage and the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars per day in well operators’ production revenue. Since these events ordinarily arise from equipment failures or human error, it is impossible to predict accurately the timing or scope of this work. Additionally, less critical events frequently occur in connection with the drilling of new wells in high-pressure reservoirs. In these situations, the Company is called upon to supervise and assist in the well control effort so that drilling operations can resume as promptly as safety permits.
Wireline Services. Wireline is classified into two types of services: slick or braided line and electric line. In both, a spooled wire is unwound and lowered into a well, conveying various types of tools or equipment. Slick or braided line services use a non-conductive line primarily for jarring objects into or out of a well, as in fishing or plug-setting operations. Electric line services lower an electrical conductor line into a well allowing the use of electrically-operated tools such as perforators, bridge plugs and logging tools. Wireline services can be an integral part of the plug and abandonment process near the end of the life cycle of a well.
Fishing. Fishing involves the use of specialized tools and procedures to retrieve lost equipment from a well drilling operation and producing wells. It is a service required by oil and gas operators who have lost equipment in a well. Oil and natural gas production from an affected well typically declines until the lost equipment can be retrieved. In some cases, the Company creates customized tools to perform a fishing operation. The customized tools are maintained by the Company after the particular fishing job for future use if a similar need arises.




​

Support Services
Rental Tools. Rental tools accounted for four percent of revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company rents specialized equipment for use with onshore and offshore oil and gas well drilling, completion and workover activities. The drilling and subsequent operation of oil and gas wells generally require a variety of equipment. The equipment needed is in large part determined by the geological features of the production zone and the size of the well itself. As a result, operators and drilling contractors often find it more economical to supplement their tool and tubular assets with rental items instead of owning a complete set of assets. The Company’s facilities are strategically located to serve the major staging points for oil and gas activities in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent region, Rocky Mountain and the Appalachian region.
Patterson Rental Tools offers a broad range of rental tools including drill pipe and associated handling tools, blowout preventers and a variety of tool assemblages that provide well control. 
​
Oilfield Pipe Inspection Services, Pipe Management and Pipe Storage. Pipe inspection services include Full Body Electromagnetic and Phased Array Ultrasonic inspection of pipe used in oil and gas wells. These services are provided at both the Company’s inspection facilities and at independent tubular mills in accordance with negotiated sales and/or service contracts. Our customers are major oil companies and steel mills, for which we provide in-house inspection services, inventory management and process control of tubing, casing and drill pipe. Our locations in Channelview, Texas and Morgan City, Louisiana are equipped with large capacity cranes, specially designed forklifts and a computerized inventory system to serve a variety of storage and handling services for both oilfield and non-oilfield customers.
Well Control School. Well Control School provides industry and government accredited training for the oil and gas industry both in the United States and in limited international locations. Well Control School provides training in various formats including conventional classroom training, interactive computer training including training delivered over the internet, and mobile simulator training.

Industry
United States. RPC provides its services to its domestic customers through a network of facilities strategically located to serve oil and gas drilling and production activities of its customers in Texas, the mid-continent, the southwest, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountain and the Appalachian regions. Demand for RPC’s services in the U.S. is extremely volatile and fluctuates with current and projected price levels of oil and natural gas and activity levels in the oil and gas industry. Customer activity levels are influenced by their decisions about capital investment toward the development and production of oil and gas reserves. 
Due to improved drilling technology, the drilling rig count in the U.S. has declined dramatically since the early 1980’s (source: Baker Hughes, Inc.). Due to continuously enhanced rig and other technologies during the last decade, an increased number of wells have been drilled during periods of strong industry activity, and the domestic production of both oil and natural gas in these wells rose to record levels in 2019. Oil and gas industry activity levels have historically been volatile, experiencing multiple cycles, including seven down cycle troughs between 1981 and 2020, with August 2020 marking the lowest U.S. domestic rig count in U.S. oilfield history. Between August 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2022, the U.S. domestic rig count rose by approximately 206 percent.
Since the majority of RPC’s services are utilized at the completion stage of an oil or gas well’s life cycle, the Company closely monitors well completion trends in the U.S. domestic oilfield. As recently reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, annual well completions fell from a cyclical peak of 21,382 in 2014 to 8,135 in 2016. Between 2016 and 2019, annual well completions increased by 6,227 or 76.6 percent. During the oilfield downturn that occurred in 2020, only 7,387 wells were completed, the lowest number of annual well completions recorded during the nine years that these data have been reported. During 2022, reported well completions increased to 11,451, an increase of approximately 22 percent compared to 2021.
Historical fluctuations in domestic drilling and completions activity are consistent with the prices of oil and natural gas, global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, the domestic supply of natural gas, capital availability to fund the operations of exploration and production companies, projected near-term economic growth and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets. Following the most recent cyclical peak in the fourth quarter of 2018, the price of oil fell by approximately 25 percent by the first quarter of 2020. During 2020, the historic collapse in oil prices discouraged drilling and production activity as our customers faced a potential collapse in global oil demand. Following the cyclical trough in oilfield activity which occurred in the third quarter of 2020, commodity prices and the U.S. domestic rig count began to recover, and by the end of 2021, the U.S. domestic rig count was more than 100 percent higher than the historic low level recorded in 2020. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the U.S domestic rig count continued to rise as customer activities increased due to higher oil process and global uncertainty caused by Russia’s invasion of 



​

Ukraine. By the end of 2022, the U.S. domestic rig count had risen to the level recorded immediately prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. The Company anticipates that oilfield activity will remain consistent with this level during 2023. Fluctuations in the prices of these commodities, particularly the price of oil, significantly impact RPC’s financial results.
The average price of natural gas increased by approximately 64.1 percent during 2022 as compared with 2021. Early in the first quarter of 2023, the price of natural gas was approximately 15.6 percent lower than the price at the end of 2022 (source: U.S. Energy Information Administration). RPC believes that the recent decrease in the price of natural gas may discourage drilling and completion of natural gas-directed wells during the near term. In addition to oil and natural gas, the prices of various natural gas liquids also determine our customers’ activity levels, since it is produced in many of the shale resource plays which also produce oil, and production of various natural gas liquids has increased to a level comparable to that of natural gas. During 2022 the average price of benchmark natural gas liquids increased by approximately seven percent compared with 2021 (source: U.S. Energy Information Administration). Early in the first quarter of 2023, the price of natural gas liquids was approximately 14.5 percent higher than the price at the end of 2022. 
During the first decade of the twenty-first century, natural gas-directed drilling rigs comprised most of the U.S. drilling rig count. Beginning in 2010, the percentage of drilling rigs drilling for natural gas began to decline, and since that time has consistently comprised less than 50 percent of total U.S. drilling. Rising U.S. domestic demand for natural gas and the advent of U.S. exports of liquified natural gas have been offset by increasing production, thus preventing the price of natural gas from rising. During 2022, however, the price of natural gas increased significantly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as many European countries boycotted imported Russian natural gas and signaled an increasing reliance on sources such as the U.S. The price of U.S. natural gas has fallen significantly early in the first quarter of 2023, due to a warm winter in Western Europe and insufficient U.S. export capacity. However, the Company believes that future export demand will continue to be strong, and combined with increased natural gas export capacity, will encourage natural gas-directed drilling in the future. In spite of this potential increase in demand and export infrastructure, we anticipate that oil-directed drilling will continue to represent the majority of the total drilling rig count for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe in the long-term importance of our business due to continued worldwide demand for hydrocarbons generally and the high production of oil in the domestic U.S. market. 
Unconventional wells are drilled in a direction other than a straight vertical direction from the Earth’s surface. Because they are drilled through relatively impermeable formations such as shale, they require additional stimulation when they are completed. Also, many of these formations require high pumping rates of stimulation fluids under high pressures, which can only be accomplished by using a great deal of pressure pumping horsepower to complete the well. Furthermore, since these types of wells are not drilled in a straight vertical direction, they require tools and drilling mechanisms that are flexible, rather than rigid, and can be steered once they are downhole. For these reasons, unconventional wells require more of RPC’s services than conventional wells. Specifically, these types of wells require RPC’s pressure pumping and coiled tubing services, as well as our downhole tools and services. Since 2016, unconventional oil and gas wells have comprised greater than 80 percent of U.S. domestic drilling and RPC believes that they will continue to comprise the majority of drilling activity because of their high initial production rates. The advent of unconventional drilling in the U.S. domestic market, which RPC believes to be a permanent change, continues to have a positive impact on the demand for RPC’s services.
International.  RPC has historically operated in several countries outside of the United States, and international revenues accounted for two percent of RPC’s consolidated revenues in 2022, four percent in 2021 and six percent in 2020. RPC’s allocation of growth capital over the last several years have emphasized domestic rather than international expansion because of higher domestic activity levels and expected financial returns. International revenues increased 4.3 percent in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher customer activity levels in Canada. During 2022, RPC provided downhole motors and tools in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. We continue to focus on the selected development of international opportunities in these and other markets, although we believe that it will continue to be less than ten percent of total revenues in 2023.




​

RPC provides services to its international customers through branch locations or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The international market is prone to political uncertainties, including the risk of civil unrest and conflicts. However, due to the significant investment requirement and complexity of international projects, customers’ drilling decisions relating to such projects tend to be evaluated and monitored with a longer-term perspective with regard to oil and natural gas pricing, and therefore have the potential to be more stable than most U.S. domestic operations. Additionally, the international market is dominated by major oil companies and national oil companies which tend to have different objectives and more operating stability than the typical independent oil and gas producer in the U.S. Predicting the timing and duration of contract work is not possible. Refer to Note 15 in the consolidated financial statements for further information on our international operations.
Growth Strategies
RPC’s primary objective is to generate excellent long-term returns on investment through the effective and conservative management of its invested capital to generate strong cash flow. This objective continues to be pursued through strategic investments and opportunities designed to enhance the long-term value of RPC while improving market share, product offerings and the profitability of existing businesses. Growth strategies are focused on selected customers and markets in which we believe there exist opportunities for higher growth, customer and market penetration, or enhanced returns achieved through consolidations or through providing proprietary value-added equipment and services. RPC intends to focus on specific market segments in which it believes that it has a competitive advantage and on potential large customers who have a long-term need for our services in markets in which we operate.
RPC seeks to expand its service capabilities through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. Historically, we have found that we generate higher financial returns from organic growth with our services and geographical locations in which we have experience. Because of the fragmented nature of the oil and gas services industry, RPC believes a number of acquisition opportunities exist, and we frequently consider such opportunities. We have consummated relatively few acquisitions in recent years, however, due to high seller valuation expectations and the risk of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. We will continue to consider the acquisitions of existing businesses but will also continue to maintain a conservative capital structure, which may limit our ability to consummate large transactions.
RPC has a revolving credit facility which can be used to fund working capital and other capital requirements. The borrowing base for this credit facility is $100 million, including a $35 million letter of credit sublimit, and a $35 million swingline sublimit. There was no outstanding balance on this credit facility as of December 31, 2022. Our capital structure is more conservative than that of many of our peers.
Customers
Demand for RPC’s services and equipment depends primarily upon the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of such wells, the number of well completions and the level of production enhancement activity worldwide. RPC’s principal customers consist of major and independent oil and natural gas producing companies. During 2022, RPC provided oilfield services to several hundred customers. Of these customers, only one customer, a private exploration and production company, accounted for approximately 11 percent of the Company’s revenues in 2022 with no other customers exceeding 10 percent of revenues in 2022. There was no customer in 2021 that accounted for 10 percent or more of revenues.
Sales are generated by RPC’s sales force and through referrals from existing customers. We monitor closely the financial condition of these customers, their capital expenditure plans, and other indications of their drilling and completion activities. Due to the short lead time between ordering services or equipment and providing services or delivering equipment, there is no significant sales backlog.

Competition
RPC operates in highly competitive areas of the oilfield services industry. We sell our equipment and services in highly competitive markets, and the revenues and earnings generated are affected by changes in prices for our services, fluctuations in the level of customer activity in major markets, general economic conditions and governmental regulation. RPC competes with many large and small oilfield industry competitors, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies. During the oilfield downturn that began in 2015, a number of oilfield services companies reduced the scope of their operations or became insolvent. During the most recent downturn that began in 2019, fewer oilfield services companies became insolvent than in the previous downturn, partially because of COVID-19 – related Federal stimulus that supported operations that would otherwise have become insolvent. Oilfield activity levels began to improve during the fourth quarter of 2020, and pricing for our services began to improve during the fourth quarter of 2021, both of which supported the operations of oilfield services companies that remained in operation. During 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine destabilized global oil markets, causing prices to rise, while also increasing the attractiveness of the U.S. 



​

domestic oilfield due to its oil and natural gas reserves, political stability and downstream energy infrastructure. In addition, improving completion services efficiency has served to increase effective capacity and impose another catalyst for declining pricing and utilization. The combination of a large number of oilfield services companies and the increased efficiency with which these companies provide services have caused the oilfield services business to remain competitive. RPC believes that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that it serves are product availability and quality of our equipment and raw materials used to provide our services, service quality, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, and price.
The oil and gas services industry includes dominant global competitors including, among others, Halliburton Energy Services Group, a division of Halliburton Company, Baker Hughes Company, and Schlumberger Ltd. The industry also includes a number of other publicly traded peers whose operations are more similar to RPC, including Liberty Oilfield Services, Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc., NexTier Oilfield Solutions, Nine Energy Services, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProFrac and ProPetro Holding Corporation, as well as numerous smaller, locally owned competitors.

The table below shows the number of employees at December 31, 2022 and 2021:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------+---+-------+---+------
At December 31, | | 2022 | | 2021 
Employees | | 2,732 | | 2,250

​
The Company operates in a cyclical business where financial performance and headcount is influenced by, among other things, changes in oil and natural gas prices. The Company’s key human capital management objectives are focused on fostering talent in the following areas:
Diversity and Equality - The Company’s workforce is diverse and our dedicated team of employees works towards a common purpose. Our Company is strong in its values, relationships and consistency in management. We have long been dedicated to recruiting and hiring recently discharged military personnel, and dedicated resources undertake this recruiting effort at our company. The Company received the U.S. Department of Labor's "2019 Hire Vets Medallion Award" in recognition of this effort and its success. The Board of Directors has a Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee that monitors compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws related to race, gender and other protected classes. The Committee provides a report of such incidences to the Board on an annual basis.
Development and Training - The Company’s management team and all its employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. We have implemented and maintained a corporate compliance program to provide guidance for everyone associated with the Company, including its employees, officers and directors (the "Code"). The code prohibits unlawful or unethical activity, including discrimination, and directs our employees, officers, and directors to avoid actions that, even if not unlawful or unethical, might create an appearance of illegality or impropriety. The Code is updated annually and certain employees at the supervisory level and above are required to review the code; any reported non-compliance is followed up on and resolved, as appropriate. In addition, the Company provides annual training for preventing, identifying, reporting and ending any type of unlawful discrimination. We also have escalation policies in place to address various issues including employee discrimination. The Company also provides a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with in-classroom and online training, on-the-job experience and counseling.
Compensation and Benefits - The Company focuses on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefit packages that are competitive in the market, taking into account the location and responsibilities of the job. We provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match, and generally grant awards of restricted stock for certain of our salaried employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status.
RPC has always believed in the long-term value of education, and has demonstrated this belief through a college scholarship program for the children of employees. This program, which awards four-year college scholarships based on merit, parents' tenure, and need has invested more than $1 million to support hundreds of children of employees as they earn college degrees. A number of these college graduates have come to work for RPC and have followed their parents to become valuable employees.
RPC and its subsidiaries have regularly participated in efforts to support the communities in which we live. We have participated in the United Way Campaign in the city in which our corporate headquarters is located for more than 30 years. In addition, we have sponsored several emergency relief efforts following natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornados, in communities in which our field offices are located.



​

Safety - The Company adheres to a comprehensive safety program to promote a safe working environment for its employees, contractors and customers at its operational locations and active job sites. This program complies with applicable regulatory guidelines for oilfield operations and is enhanced by our analysis of workplace-related incidents and evolving preventative measures. We monitor our workplace safety record and compare it to industry benchmarks and our internal metrics to find areas for improvement. 
RPC is making technology and process investments which reduce the number of employees on a job location and change the roles of the remaining employees in ways that reduce their exposure to safety hazards. We believe that this reduced exposure to active areas of a job location has led to fewer safety incidents in a service line which has a high concentration of employees.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a response plan that we believe was in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. This included transitioning our workforce to a remote work model where possible, while implementing additional safety measures for essential employees continuing critical on-site work.
Facilities/Equipment
RPC’s equipment consists primarily of oil and gas services equipment used either in servicing customer wells or provided on a rental basis for customer use. Most of this equipment is Company owned. RPC purchases oilfield service equipment from a limited number of manufacturers. These manufacturers may not be able to meet our requests for timely delivery during periods of high demand which may result in delayed deliveries of equipment and higher prices for equipment.
RPC owns and leases regional and district facilities from which its oilfield services are provided to land-based and offshore customers. RPC’s principal executive offices in Atlanta, Georgia are leased. The Company has four primary administrative buildings, two leased facilities, one in each of The Woodlands, Texas, and Midland, Texas, that include the Company’s operations, engineering, sales and marketing headquarters, and two owned facilities, one in Houma, Louisiana that includes certain administrative functions and one in Newcastle, Oklahoma that includes certain administrative functions, operations, engineering, sales and equipment storage yards. RPC believes that its facilities are adequate for its current operations. For additional information with respect to RPC’s lease commitments, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements.
Governmental Regulation
RPC’s business is affected by state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the oil and gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. RPC cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on it, its businesses or financial condition. More stringent environmental standards compel the Company to buy more expensive equipment to meet those standards and also renders older equipment obsolete. 
In addition, our customers are affected by laws and regulations relating to the exploration and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers’ activities. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers’ activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.
Intellectual Property
RPC uses several patented items in its operations which management believes are important, but are not indispensable, to RPC’s success. Although RPC anticipates seeking patent protection when possible, it relies to a greater extent on the technical expertise and know-how of its personnel to maintain its competitive position.
Availability of Filings
RPC makes available, free of charge, on its website, rpc.net, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports on the same day they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
