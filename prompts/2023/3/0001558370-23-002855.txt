Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a life sciences company that has developed next-generation, ultra-sensitive digital immunoassay platforms that advance life sciences research and diagnostics. Our platforms are based on our proprietary digital “Simoa” detection technology. Our Simoa bead-based and planar array platforms enable customers to reliably detect protein biomarkers in extremely low concentrations in blood, serum and other fluids that, in many cases, are undetectable using conventional, analog immunoassay technologies, and also allow researchers to define and validate the function of novel protein biomarkers that are only present in very low concentrations. These capabilities provide our customers with insight into the role of protein biomarkers in human health that has not been possible with other existing technologies and enable researchers to unlock unique insights into the continuum between health and disease. We believe this greater insight will enable the development of novel therapies and diagnostics and facilitate a paradigm shift in healthcare from an emphasis on treatment to a focus on earlier detection, monitoring, prognosis and, ultimately, prevention.
We believe that our Simoa platforms are among the most sensitive commercially available multiplex protein detection platforms and significantly advance enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology, which has been the industry standard for protein detection for over 45 years. Proteins are complex molecules that are required for the structure, function and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs, and are the functional units that carry out specific tasks in every cell. The human body contains approximately 20,000 genes, each of which can produce multiple proteins. It is estimated that these 20,000 genes can produce over 100,000 different proteins, of which 10,000 – 15,000 are estimated to be secreted in blood. Proteins are considered to be the best analytes – providing the most real-time picture of disease, and researchers and clinicians rely extensively on protein biomarkers for use as research and clinical tools. However, normal physiological levels of many proteins are not detectable in easily accessible blood samples using conventional, analog immunoassay technologies, and many of these technologies can only detect proteins once they have reached levels that reflect more advanced disease or injury. For many other low abundance proteins, these technologies cannot detect proteins even at disease- or injury-elevated levels. We believe that Simoa’s sensitivity offers a new way to monitor healthy individuals and detect proteins associated with nascent disease or injury early in the disease cascade, which holds the key to intervention before disease or injury has advanced to the point where more significant clinical signs and symptoms have appeared.
Our Simoa platforms have achieved significant scientific validation and commercial adoption. Simoa technology has been cited in over 2,000 scientific publications in areas of high unmet medical need and research interest such as neurology, oncology, cardiology, infectious disease and inflammation. Our growing customer base is comprised of over 1,300 customers across our end markets. 
Restructuring and Strategic Re-Alignment
Following a strategic review and assessment of our operations and cost structure, in the third quarter of 2022 we announced a plan of restructuring and strategic re-alignment (the Restructuring Plan). As part of this plan, we began an assay redevelopment program with the ultimate objective of improving our ability to manufacture and deliver high-quality assays at scale. The Restructuring Plan aligns our investments to best serve the needs of customers, focuses innovation efforts on key platforms and provides the foundation for our entry into translational pharma and clinical markets, which we believe will be required to access new growth categories. The Restructuring Plan included the elimination of 119 positions and other cost-saving measures. The workforce reduction was substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022.
​
Our Products and Services
Our proprietary Simoa technology is based on traditional ELISA technology, which has been the most widely used method of detection of proteins for over 45 years. Given our target customers’ familiarity with the core ELISA 

1



technology, we believe this offers us a significant competitive advantage. Our Simoa bead-based platform differs, however, from conventional ELISA in its ability to trap single molecules in tiny microwells, 40 trillionths of a milliliter, that are 2.5 billion times smaller than traditional ELISA wells, allowing for an analysis and digital readout of each individual molecule, which is not possible with conventional ELISA technology. Leveraging our proprietary sophisticated Simoa image analysis and data analysis algorithms, we have also developed a planar array technology to provide sensitivity similar to that found in our Simoa bead-based platform. We currently offer the following three Simoa instruments, which we believe are among the most sensitive multiplex protein detection platforms commercially available today:

● | HD-X: We commercially launched our HD-X instrument in the second half of 2019. The HD-X is an upgraded version of the Simoa HD-1 (our first Simoa instrument, which was launched in January 2014) that was designed to deliver significant productivity and operational efficiency improvements, as well as greater user flexibility. The HD-X is based on our bead-based technology, and assays run on the HD-X are fully automated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SR-X: We commercially launched our SR-X instrument in December 2017. The SR-X utilizes the same Simoa bead-based technology and assay kits as the HD-X in a compact benchtop form with a lower price point, more flexible assay preparation, and a wider range of potential applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SP-X: We commercially launched our SP-X instrument in April 2019. The SP-X is based on our Simoa planar array technology, which allows for significantly greater multiplexing capabilities, and is, we believe, ideal for oncology and immunology applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current menu of approximately 36 analyte-specific single-plex and multi-plex bead-based assay kits includes assays for biomarkers in the areas of neurology, infectious disease, immunology, oncology and cardiology for both human and mouse samples. The current menu of Simoa planar array reagent kits includes approximately 115 biomarkers ranging from 1-10 analytes per assay in the areas of immunology and oncology research. In addition, both the bead-based platform and the planar array platform allow ease and flexibility in assay design, enabling our customers to develop their own in-house assays, called “homebrew” assays. 
We also provide contract research services for customers through our CLIA-certified Accelerator Laboratory. The Accelerator Laboratory provides customers with access to Simoa technology and supports multiple projects and services, including sample testing, homebrew assay development and custom assay development. To date, we have completed over 1,900 projects for more than 400 customers from all over the world using our Simoa platforms. We have recently begun offering laboratory developed tests (LDTs) through the Accelerator Laboratory. LDTs are diagnostic tests that are developed, validated and performed by a single laboratory.  In July 2022, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure phospho-Tau 181 (pTau-181) in plasma as an aid in diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease, and in January 2023, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure neurofilament light chain (NfL) in serum as an aid in the evaluation of individuals for possible neurodegenerative conditions or other causes of neuronal or central nervous system damage.
In August 2019, we acquired UmanDiagnostics AB (Uman), a company located in Umeå, Sweden, that commercializes proprietary NfL antibodies and NfL ELISA kits. Uman’s NfL antibodies are widely recognized by researchers and biopharmaceutical and diagnostics companies world-wide as the premier solution for the detection of NfL to advance the development of therapeutics and diagnostics for certain neurodegenerative conditions. Since we commercially launched the first assay that could reliably measure NfL in blood using Uman’s antibodies and our Simoa technology in 2017, NfL has seen dramatic growth as a neurological biomarker. The Uman acquisition secured the NfL antibody supply critical to our industry-leading ultrasensitive Simoa NfL assays and services and provides us with additional revenue via the sale of the NfL antibodies and NfL ELISA kits. 
We sell our instruments, consumables and services to the life science, pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries through a direct sales force and support organizations in North America and Europe and through distributors or sales agents in select markets. In addition, we sell Uman’s NfL antibodies and NfL ELISA kits directly and in conjunction with a distributor worldwide. We have an extensive base of customers in world class academic and governmental

research institutions, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research companies, using our technology to gather information to better understand human health.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

● | Proprietary ultra-sensitive Simoa digital immunoassay technology platforms. We believe our Simoa platforms are among the most sensitive, commercially available protein detection platforms, and can detect and quantify proteins of clinical interest that are undetectable using conventional, analog immunoassay technologies. This sensitivity allows researchers to measure critical protein biomarkers at earlier stages in the progression of a disease or injury, which we believe will enable the development of novel therapies and diagnostics and facilitate a paradigm shift in healthcare from an emphasis on treatment to a focus on earlier detection, monitoring, prognosis and, ultimately, prevention. The sensitivity of our Simoa technology also allows researchers to gather biomarker information from smaller samples that can be collected less invasively than samples required by other assay technologies.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to enable new research into biomarkers to allow greater insight into their role in human health in ways that have not been possible with any other current research and diagnostic technology. We believe this greater 

3



insight will facilitate a paradigm shift in healthcare from an emphasis on treatment to a focus on earlier detection, monitoring, prognosis and, ultimately, prevention.
Our strategy to achieve this includes:

● | Focus on the highly attractive, expanding market for protein detection and analysis. Our focus on the detection of protein biomarkers is driven by a growing understanding of the essential role and impact of proteins on human health. While genomic research provides valuable information about the role of genes in health and disease, proteins are both more prevalent than nucleic acids and, we believe, more relevant to a precise understanding of the nuanced continuum between health and disease. Protein measurement goes beyond genetic predisposition, indicating the impact of a range of influences on health, including environmental factors and lifestyle, providing deeper and more relevant insight into what is happening in a person’s body in real time. Our technology provides a unique bridge between understanding the human genotype and phenotype, which we believe addresses a large unmet need in life science research, translational medicine and diagnostic and drug development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to drive adoption of our Simoa technology in the life science research/pharma market. We believe our Simoa technology has the potential to significantly expand the life science research market because of its unrivaled sensitivity, in particular by enabling researchers to perform studies on protein biomarkers that they were previously unable to perform. We also believe that our Simoa technology is uniquely positioned for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug trials as biomarkers are being increasingly used as an adjunct to help increase the potential of regulatory approval. We have focused initially on these markets because we believe there is reduced regulatory and reimbursement risk for us in these markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our presence in the diagnostics market. We believe Simoa technology has the capability to enable the development of a new category of less-invasive diagnostic tests and tools based on blood, serum, saliva and other fluids that could replace current invasive, expensive and inconvenient diagnostic methods, including spinal tap, diagnostic imaging and biopsy. In July 2022, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure pTau-181 in plasma as an aid in diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease, and in January 2023, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure neurofilament light chain (NfL) in serum as an aid in the evaluation of individuals for possible neurodegenerative conditions or other causes of neuronal or central nervous system damage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage the growing importance of neurological biomarkers to advance the development of therapeutics and diagnostics for neurodegenerative conditions. The importance of neurological biomarkers, such as NfL, pTau-181 and pTau-217, has increased significantly in recent years, and our ultra-sensitive Simoa platforms have allowed research of neurological disorders, previously limited primarily to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to expand significantly. Neuro biomarkers, such as NfL, pTau-217 and pTau-181, have shown increasing relevance in neurological research and drug development. In 2021, Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) presented new data from its Phase 2 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study of its Alzheimer’s disease drug candidate donanemab, which employed our ultra-sensitive Simoa technology to measure plasma pTau-217, using antibodies developed by Lilly. Lilly reported a significant reduction in blood levels of phosphorylated Tau protein after treatment with donanemab, and that a reduction in plasma pTau-217 levels correlated with the slowing of cognitive decline. In November 2022, Eisai Co., Ltd. and Biogen Corporation presented results from the Phase 3 clinical trial (Clarity AD) of lecanemab, an investigational drug aimed at slowing the progression of cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Target engagement and activity of the drug in downstream processes was explored with a panel of fluid biomarkers, including plasma pTau-181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NfL using Quanterix’s ultrasensitive Simoa assay kits We believe that the use of biomarkers in clinical trials for neurological conditions is becoming increasingly important. With Simoa’s sensitivity and its ability to detect many neurological biomarkers in blood and plasma that cannot be detected by many other technologies, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Expand further into indications beyond neurology. Because the blood-brain barrier severely restricts the movement of proteins and other substances into blood circulation, we believe that our ultra-sensitive Simoa platforms are particularly well suited for neurology indications. We also believe, however, that the ability of our Simoa technology to detect and quantify low abundance proteins is a distinct advantage in detecting disease earlier in other indications, including oncology, cardiology, infectious disease and inflammation, and there are nearly 700 scientific publications using our Simoa technologies in these non-neurology indications. We intend to expand further into these markets, with a particular focus on oncology. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry Background
We intend to pursue the application of our Simoa technology to the life science research/pharma and diagnostics markets. Our initial commercial strategy has targeted the large and growing life science research/pharma markets, and we believe that the diagnostics market represents a significant commercial opportunity for Simoa. Based on industry estimates, we believe the aggregate commercial opportunity across these markets is approximately $75 billion.
Proteins are versatile macromolecules and serve critical functions in nearly all biological processes. They are complex molecules that organisms require for the structure, function and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs. For example, proteins provide immune protection, generate movement, transmit nerve impulses and control cell growth and differentiation. Understanding an organism’s proteome, the complete set of proteins and their expression levels, can provide a powerful and unique window into its health, a window that other types of research, such as genomics, cannot provide.
The human body contains approximately 20,000 genes. One of the core functions of genes, which are comprised of DNA, is to regulate protein production—which ones are produced, the volume of each, and for how long—influenced by both biological and environmental factors. These 20,000 genes help govern the expression of over 100,000 proteins, of which 10,000 – 15,000 are estimated to be secreted in blood, the majority of which cannot be consistently detected in healthy individuals using conventional immunoassay technologies. Accordingly, the study of much of the proteome has not been practical given the limited level of sensitivity of existing technologies. 
Much like the sequencing of the human genome with the Human Genome Project and the development of both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing technologies to detect nucleic acids, both of which accelerated biomedical genomic research, we believe the ability to study more of the proteome enabled by our more sensitive protein detection technology will have a profound impact on proteomic research. With our ultra-sensitive Simoa detection technology, researchers can assess the symptoms of disease or injury and compare them to the presence and levels of relevant proteins that are not detectable using conventional technologies, leading to a better understanding of how proteins individually and/or collectively impact and influence important biological processes and the health and well-being of individuals. We believe this research into understanding the individual characteristics and functioning of proteins will be central to earlier detection, monitoring, prognosis and, ultimately, prevention by providing researchers with the ability to assess the impact of particular proteins on the progress of disease and injury from the time of early onset of symptoms.
Existing Technologies and Their Limitations
Protein Analysis
ELISA has been the most widely used method of sensitive detection of proteins for over 45 years. In simple terms, in ELISA, an unknown amount of antigen (e.g., protein, peptide, antibody, hormone) is affixed to a solid surface, usually a polystyrene multiwell plate, either directly, or indirectly through use of a conjugated secondary or “capture” antibody (sandwich ELISA). A specific “detection” antibody is applied over the surface to bind to the antigen. This detection antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step, a substance called an enzyme substrate is added, and the 

5



enzyme converts to colored or fluorescent product molecules, which are detected by a plate reader. Sandwich ELISA is depicted in the graphic below:

Aside from ELISA, there are other technologies available for protein analysis today, such as Western blotting, mass spectrometry, chromatography, surface plasmon resonance, Raman-enhanced signal detection, immuno-PCR, and biobarcode assay. However, the proteins detectable by these conventional, analog immunoassay technologies represent a mere fraction of the 10,000-15,000 secreted proteins in circulation in human blood. While a number of techniques have been used to attempt to increase sensitivity of detection, we believe all of these approaches have limitations, including:

● | dilution of colored or fluorescent product molecules due to large volume of liquid in traditional-sized wells, limiting sensitivity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | narrow dynamic range (i.e., the range of concentration of proteins being detected), that may require sample dilution, diluting molecules and increasing sample volume requiring additional enzymes to reach detection limit;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | low detection limit of readers restricts sensitivity and ability to detect low abundance proteins, particularly when proteins are at normal physiological levels; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limited success in increasing sensitivity of detection due to procedural complexity and length.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genomic Analysis
Over the past few decades, scientists have developed a variety of genomic analysis methods to measure an increasing number of genomic biomarkers aimed at detecting diseases. The most widely used method for genetic testing is PCR, which involves amplifying, or generating billions of copies of, the DNA sequence in question and then detecting the DNA with the use of fluorescent dyes. PCR is used to amplify the nucleic acid through the use of enzymes and repeated heating and cooling cycles, with fluorescent dyes incorporated during each amplification cycle. The expression of the nucleic acid is then inferred based on the number of amplification cycles required for the target to become detectable. PCR is sometimes referred to as an analog technology because the number of cycles of amplification, rather than a direct measure, is used to infer the level of gene expression. The wide availability of PCR chemistry makes it a popular approach for measuring the expression of nucleic acids, but the use of enzymes in numerous cycles of amplification can introduce distortion and bias into the data, potentially compromising the reliability of results, particularly at low concentrations.

Our Simoa Technology
Our Simoa technology significantly advances conventional sandwich ELISA technology and is capable of unprecedented protein detection sensitivity.
Simoa Bead-Based Technology
Simoa bead-based digital immunoassays utilize the basic principles of conventional bead-based sandwich ELISA and require two antibodies: one for capture, which is applied to the beads, and one for detection. Unlike ELISA, which runs the enzyme-substrate reaction on all molecules in one well, Simoa bead-based reactions are run on individual molecules in tiny microwells, 40 trillionths of a milliliter that are 2.5 billion times smaller than traditional ELISA wells. Traditional ELISA analog measurements increase in intensity only as the concentration of a sample increases. Simoa bead-based digital technology measurements, however, are independent of sample concentration intensity and rely on a binary signal/no signal readout, enabling detection sensitivity that was not previously possible.
Our Simoa bead-based platform is highly flexible, designed to enable practical high-sensitivity protein analysis for academic researchers looking at novel proteins all the way through to high throughput analysis performed by large biopharmaceutical organizations. The following chart describes the steps through which our Simoa bead-based technology detects proteins:
Simoa Bead-Based Analytic Process
​

​​​ | 
------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Preparation of ELISA Sandwich​ | Simoa bead-based technology uses beads coated with capture antibodies that bind specifically to the protein being measured. After an enzyme-linked detection antibody binds to the protein, the enzyme substrate is added (as depicted by the white star in the graphic on the left). The enzyme associated with the enzyme-linked detection antibody then reacts with the enzyme substrate causing the enzyme substrate to become fluorescent (as depicted by the change in color of the star in the graphic).
Injection of Bead/Substrate Solution into Simoa Disk​ | This mixture of beads and enzyme substrate is then injected into our proprietary Simoa disk, which contains 24 arrays of microwells arranged radially. Each 3 × 4 millimeter array contains approximately 239,000 microwells, each of which is large enough to accommodate only a single bead. 

7




Bead/Substrate Solution Settles and Wells are Sealed​​​ | The bead/substrate solution is drawn across the array and the beads settle by gravity onto the surface of the array, and a fraction of them fall into the microwells. The remainder lie on the surface, and oil is introduced into the channel to displace the substrate solution and excess beads, and to seal the wells.
--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simoa Readout​ | The entire array is then imaged using ultrasensitive digital imaging, and the sealed wells that contain beads associated with captured and enzyme labeled protein molecules are identified. 

​
The ability to multiplex, or simultaneously measure multiple proteins (or other biomarkers) in a single assay, can be important to researchers to maximize the biological information from a sample and to develop more specific diagnostic tests. However, one of the main issues with multiplexing can be the loss of sensitivity. Our Simoa platforms maintain single plex precision, while competitive platforms lose sensitivity when multiplexing is used. Multiplexing is achieved with our Simoa bead-based technology by using beads labeled with different fluorescent dyes specific to the biomarker being analyzed. After the assay is run, the array of microwells is imaged across the wavelengths of the different labeled beads. The results are measured for each protein captured by each of the different beads. In 2017, we commercially launched a Simoa neurology 4-plex assay (NfL, tau, GFAP and UCH-L1) for the study of neurodegenerative conditions and traumatic brain injury. In 2020, we introduced a Simoa 4-plex assay (Aβ40, Aβ42, GFAP, NfL) designed to measure key biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. Whereas other assay technologies require CSF to detect all four of these markers, or are limited to only single-plex measurement in serum and plasma, due to Simoa’s sensitivity, we believe this is the only assay that can detect all of these biomarkers directly from serum and plasma samples in a multiplex assay format. This is a significant advantage in terms of ease of use, patient comfort, speed and cost-effectiveness. While we have demonstrated the ability to identify and differentiate up to 35 different bead subpopulations on the HD-X, which is a prerequisite to our ability to develop assays with the capacity to detect an equivalent number of proteins in a single sample, we believe that the ability to multiplex at high levels and maintain single-plex sensitivity and precision is currently limited using bead-based technology due to constraints in the number of bead-containing wells for each plex that are imaged on the Simoa disk. However, our bead-based assay technology was used by researchers to demonstrate a novel workflow to expand multiplexing through a process of sequential incubation steps. We plan to explore this and other methods to potentially expand the multiplexing capabilities of our Simoa assay technology to enable plexing of 10-20 plex over the next several years.

Simoa Planar Array Technology
Simoa planar array immunoassays utilize the basic principles of conventional microplate-based sandwich ELISA and require two antibodies: one for capture, which is applied to the beads, and one for detection. Unlike ELISA, which runs the enzyme-substrate reaction on all molecules coating the entire bottom surface in one well, Simoa planar array reactions are run on spatially segregated micro-spots within the bottom of microtiter plate wells that concentrate the signal to a surface area 1,000 times smaller than a traditional ELISA. The small spot size and spatial segregation of each spot enables multiplexing up to 12 different assays within a single sample well.
Our Simoa planar array platform is highly flexible, designed to enable practical high-sensitivity multiplex protein analysis for drug discovery and development applications as well as translational biomarker research. The following chart describes the steps through which our Simoa planar array technology detects proteins:
Simoa Planar Array Analytic Process

A) | Analyte-specific capture antibodies are printed in microspots (100 microns) in a circular pattern in the bottom of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each microspot contains capture antibodies that are specific for different analytes. Up to 12 spatially resolved microspots can be printed in each well.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


B) | Samples are added to the plate and incubated with a benchtop plate shaker to bind the target analyte molecules to the microspots. Unbound molecules are removed by washing the plate with a benchtop plate washer or manual wash manifold.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


C) | A mixture of biotinylated detection antibodies are added to the plate to form the antibody sandwich. Excess detection antibodies are removed by washing.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


D) | Streptavidin-HRP (horseradish peroxidase enzyme) conjugated is added to the plate to bind to the biotin groups forming the complete immunocomplex followed by a washing step.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


E) | A high-sensitivity chemiluminescent substate reagent is added to each well. The enzyme associated with the enzyme linked detection antibody then reacts with the enzyme substrate causing the enzyme substrate to emit light.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


F) | The plate is placed into the Quanterix SP-X imaging system. A scientific-grade CCD camera images the entire plate and all micro-spots simultaneously. The low background of the plate surface and the high-sensitivity of the camera enable detection of very low levels of light with a high dynamic range. The imaging software utilizes algorithms to optimize exposure time

and combine multiple images in the image analysis. Protein concentrations are determined by comparing the intensity of microspots to known analytical standards.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an image of a 96-well Simoa planar array plate containing 12 microspots. Each microspot represents a different analyte measured in each sample well.

We believe the Simoa planar array technology is well-suited for researchers who value the ability to measure critical immunomodulatory biomarkers in patient serum and plasma with ultra-sensitive detection in a multiplex assay format. The figure below demonstrates 10-plex detection of key cytokines in human serum from normal healthy donors with corresponding assay Limit of Detection (LoD) listed in femtogram per ml.

Nucleic Acid Testing
Our initial focus has been on the use of Simoa technology to detect protein biomarkers. However, our Simoa bead-based technology has also been used to detect nucleic acids in biological samples. While methods for measuring nucleic acid molecules have advanced substantially, currently available techniques still have drawbacks. For example, PCR is a sensitive method that is widely used for measuring gene expression. However, PCR carries the potential for data distortion and bias from the repeated addition of enzymes, and heating and cooling cycles needed to amplify a copy of the nucleic acid being measured. In nucleic acid analysis, we believe that Simoa has the potential to provide the same sensitivity as traditional PCR-based assays with the following benefits:

● | no need for amplification of the targeted nucleic acid, which can result in amplification distortion and bias;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced cross-contamination because of direct detection of single molecules vs. the detection of a large number of copies of the nucleic acid; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to detect some samples without requiring purification of the nucleic acid, such as in environmental water or serum samples.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10



For detection of nucleic acids with our Simoa bead-based technology, instead of coating the beads with capture antibodies as is done for detecting proteins, the beads are coated with nucleic acid capture probes. Samples with the target nucleic acid molecules are then added and are captured by the beads. Nucleic acid detection probes (instead of detection antibodies) are then added and attach to the target nucleic acid molecules which are then labeled using an enzyme substrate that is detected and counted using the Simoa disk and instrument. 
Our Market Opportunities
Our commercial strategy is to pursue the application of our Simoa technology to the life science research/pharma and diagnostics markets.
Life Science Research/Pharma Markets
We have initially targeted the large and growing life science research and pharma markets. We have chosen these markets to target initially because of the reduced regulatory and reimbursement risk. We believe our Simoa platforms are well-positioned to capture a significant share of these markets because of superior sensitivity, automated workflow capabilities, multiplexing and the ability to work with a broader range of sample types.
Proteomics, the study of the proteins produced by the body, is important to understanding disease, and researchers study proteins to understand the biological basis for disease and how to improve diagnosis and treatment. The proteins detectable by conventional, analog immunoassay technologies represent a mere fraction of the proteins that can be detected by Simoa technology, and we believe that Simoa can inspire a new level of research into these previously undetectable proteins and their role in disease. By substantially lowering the limit of detection of protein biomarkers, our Simoa platforms hold significant potential to expand research into the diseases associated with the thousands of proteins that were previously undetectable, as well as into earlier detection of the proteins currently detectable by other technologies only after they have reached levels that reflect more advanced disease or injury. Simoa technology provides researchers the ability to see the nuanced continuum of health to disease more efficiently and effectively than any other technology commercially available today, offering the potential for the first time to better understand the onset of disease cascades and catalyzing a new era of medical and life science research, drug discovery and disease prevention.
In addition, as pharmaceutical companies look for ways to more efficiently and effectively develop and obtain regulatory approval for drugs, use of biomarkers in clinical drug trials is becoming more prevalent. Biomarkers are increasingly being used as clinical endpoints in clinical trials. Drug developers can also use diagnostics to stratify patients and select only those patients for whom a drug is expected to be most effective and safe. Using Simoa’s unprecedented sensitivity to measure previously undetectable levels of target biomarkers prior to and following administration of a drug, drug developers can non-invasively and objectively determine whether a drug candidate is having a desired impact on the target biomarker. In addition, researchers can also use Simoa to monitor a drug candidate’s unwanted effect on “off-target” biomarkers and predict side effects, addressing the significant issue of drug toxicity, which is a leading cause of death in the United States. With Simoa’s sensitivity and its ability to detect many biomarkers in blood, plasma and other non-invasive samples that cannot be detected by many other technologies, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. 
Based on industry estimates, we believe the proteomics life science research/pharma total addressable market is approximately $20 billion. 
Diagnostics
The diagnostic market represents a significant commercial opportunity for our Simoa technology as well. We believe existing biomarker diagnostics can be improved by Simoa’s sensitivity to enable earlier detection of diseases and injuries, and that new diagnostics may be developed using protein biomarkers that are not detectable using conventional, analog immunoassay technologies but are detectable using Simoa technology. We also believe that the ultra-sensitive protein detection provided by our Simoa platforms can enable the development of a new category of non-invasive 

11



diagnostic tests and tools based on blood, serum and other fluids that have the potential to replace current more invasive, expensive and inconvenient diagnostic methods, including spinal tap, diagnostic imaging and biopsy.
Simoa technology also has significant potential in the emerging field of screening and diagnostics. A screen, aid to diagnostic, or diagnostic test is a biomarker test that is specifically linked to a therapeutic drug that can help predict how a patient will respond to the drug. Drug developers can use these tests to stratify patients and select only those patients for whom a drug is expected to be most effective and safe. Such tests have demonstrated the ability to both improve the probability of approval and accelerate approval of new drugs. Not only could Simoa be used to develop tests to stratify patients in clinical trials and for treatment, but Simoa’s sensitivity can also enable the development of tests based on protein biomarkers that can actively and regularly monitor whether an approved drug is having the desired biological effect. This would quickly and efficiently enable doctors to adjust the course of treatment as appropriate by increasing or decreasing dosages or even switching therapies.
The ability of our Simoa platforms to detect and quantify normal physiological levels of low abundance proteins that are undetectable using conventional, analog immunoassay technologies could enable our technology to be used to monitor protein biomarker levels of seemingly healthy, asymptomatic people, and potentially to signal and provide earlier detection of the onset of disease. This has the potential to facilitate a paradigm shift in healthcare, from an emphasis on treatment to a focus on earlier detection, monitoring, prognosis and, ultimately, prevention.
We recently launched our first diagnostic LDTs in our Accelerator Laboratory. In July 2022, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure pTau-181 in plasma as an aid in diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease, and in January 2023, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure NfL in serum as an aid in the evaluation of individuals for possible neurodegenerative conditions or other causes of neuronal or central nervous system damage.
There has also been significant interest from third parties to use our technology to develop applications for the diagnostic market. Following our acquisition of Uman, we entered into a licensing and supply arrangement with Siemens Healthineers for access to Uman’s proprietary NfL antibodies, which will allow Siemens to begin developing blood-based NfL clinical diagnostic tests for future commercialization. Additionally, in September 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive License Agreement with Abbott Laboratories, pursuant to which we granted Abbott a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under our bead-based single molecule detection patents for IVD use.
Based on industry estimates, we believe the proteomics diagnostic total addressable market is approximately $55 billion.
See “Government Regulation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Diagnostic Product Reimbursement” for a discussion regarding the regulatory approvals that may be required for use of our products for diagnostic purposes, and related risks.
Our Key Focus Areas
We have focused the application of our Simoa technology on areas of high growth and high unmet need and where existing platforms have significant shortcomings that our technology addresses, including neurology and oncology, as well as cardiology, infectious disease and inflammation.
Neurology
We believe that the ability of our Simoa technology to detect neurological biomarkers in blood at ultra-low levels, which have traditionally only been detectable in CSF, has the potential to rapidly advance neurology research and drug development, and transform the way brain diseases and injuries are diagnosed and treated. Prior to the launch of our pTau-181 LDT for clinical use in July 2022, the brain was the only organ in the body for which there was not a blood-based diagnostic test. The challenge with developing blood-based tests for the brain is that the blood-brain barrier, which is formed by endothelial cells lining the cerebral microvasculature, is very tight and severely restricts the movement of proteins and other substances between these endothelial cells and into blood circulation. Accordingly, diagnosis of brain disease and injury has traditionally required either brain imaging or a spinal tap to collect CSF, both of which are costly 

12



and highly invasive for the patient. The sensitivity of the Simoa technology has enabled researchers to discover that extremely small amounts of critical neural biomarkers diffuse through the blood-brain barrier and are released into the blood during injury and in connection with many neurodegenerative brain diseases. However, the concentrations of many these neural biomarkers in the blood can be so low that they are difficult to detect by conventional, analog immunoassay technologies. 
To date, there have been over 1,400 neurology-related scientific publications using our Simoa technologies, and we believe that ultra-sensitive digital detection of neural-related biomarkers in the blood is becoming an essential research and development tool for an increasing range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The goal of this research is to eventually develop accurate diagnostic tools, predictive health screens and, ultimately, more effective treatments. The importance of neurological biomarkers, such as NfL, pTau-181, pTau-217, GFAP and Ab42/40, has increased dramatically in recent years. In addition, biomarkers are being increasingly used as an adjunct by pharmaceutical companies in clinical trials to help increase the potential for regulatory approval, particularly in neurological indications. With Simoa’s sensitivity and its ability to detect many neurological biomarkers in blood and plasma that cannot be detected by many other technologies, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this opportunity, in particular with respect to Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis.
Dementia/Alzheimer’s Disease
Dementia is a collective name for brain syndromes that affect memory, thinking, behavior and emotion. According to Alzheimer’s Disease International, as of 2021, there were more than 55 million people worldwide living with dementia, a figure expected to increase to over 139 million by 2050, and the annual global cost of dementia is now above $1.3 trillion. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognition, function and behavior and is the most common cause of dementia. 
In November 2022 at the 15th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference, Eisai Co., Ltd. and Biogen Corporation presented results from the Phase 3 clinical trial (Clarity AD) of lecanemab, an investigational drug aimed at slowing the progression of cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Target engagement and activity of the drug in downstream processes was explored with a panel of fluid biomarkers, including plasma pTau-181, GFAP and NfL, using Quanterix’s ultrasensitive Simoa assay kits. In January 2023, the FDA approved lecanemab for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease.
In 2021, Lilly presented new data from its Phase 2 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study of its Alzheimer’s disease drug candidate donanemab, which employed our ultra-sensitive Simoa technology to measure plasma pTau-217, using antibodies developed by Lilly. Lilly reported a significant reduction in blood levels of phosphorylated Tau protein after treatment with donanemab, and that a reduction in plasma pTau-217 levels correlated with the slowing of cognitive decline. In addition, following the FDA approval of its Alzheimer’s disease drug ADUHELM™, Biogen conducted Simoa biomarker studies on Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE trial samples, utilizing Simoa technology to measure plasma pTau-181. Preliminary data was reported that showed a dose-dependent reduction in plasma pTau-181 levels following treatment with ADUHELM, which correlated with decreases in amyloid PET and a slowing of cognitive decline across four independent assessment tools.
In October 2021, the FDA granted our Simoa pTau-181 blood test Breakthrough Device designation as an aid in diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease. The FDA’s Breakthrough Device designation is granted to products that have the potential to offer more effective diagnosis of life-threatening diseases with an unmet medical need. The program is designed to enable accelerated development, assessment and review processes, with the intention to provide patients with more timely access to breakthrough technologies or devices. Proposed indications under the Breakthrough Device designation include use of the test results in adult patients, aged 50 years and over, presenting with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of cognitive decline as an aid in diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer’s disease. 
In March 2022, we were awarded funding of $2.3 million by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) in support of a proposal “Clinical Implementation of Blood-Based Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease: Clinical Validation, IVD Product Development, and Market Development.” ADDF is a philanthropic foundation which 

13



aims to accelerate Alzheimer’s drug and diagnostics development. The project is aimed at clinically validating a multi-biomarker blood test for detection of Alzheimer’s disease in a large prospective trial that includes both primary care and specialist memory clinical settings. The multi-biomarker approach is based on studies that have shown that combining the signals from multiple biomarkers relevant to Alzheimer’s pathophysiology provides greater diagnostic accuracy than any single biomarker alone. The Simoa pTau-181 assay will be part of the multi-biomarker test, as well as our GFAP, NfL, Ab42, and Ab40 assays. The latter four assays are multiplexed into a single test that measures all biomarkers simultaneously. Thus, this validation study will serve to validate pTau-181 as a standalone test and will also leverage Simoa’s multiplexing capability to combine additional biomarkers for even greater accuracy.
In addition to the ADDF clinical validation program, we are nearing completion of a second prospective clinical trial (BioHermes) in partnership with the Global Alzheimer’s Platform Foundation (GAPF). GAPF is a non-profit organization dedicated to speeding the delivery of innovative therapies to Alzheimer’s patients by reducing the time and cost of Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials. The BioHermes trial is being conducted across 17 clinical sites in the United States and is examining blood test accuracy across 1,000 cognitively normal and mildly impaired Alzheimer’s patients in comparison with amyloid PET scan. This study is expected to support a regulatory filing for FDA clearance of our pTau-181 test pursuant to the Breakthrough Device designation.
Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease affecting the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Multiple sclerosis occurs when the immune system attacks nerve fibers and myelin sheathing (a fatty substance which surrounds/insulates healthy nerve fibers) in the brain and spinal cord. This attack causes inflammation, which destroys nerve cell processes and myelin, altering electrical messages in the brain. Multiple sclerosis is unpredictable and affects each patient differently – some individuals may be mildly affected, while others may lose their ability to write, speak or walk. According to the National MS Society, more than 2.3 million people have a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis globally. In the U.S. alone, the National MS Society recently completed a prevalence study estimating nearly 1,000,000 people over the age of 18 live with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
Evidence of the potential clinical utility of NfL as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis is progressing rapidly, and Simoa’s role in that progression has been foundational. The Simoa NfL assay pioneered measurement of NfL in blood, and in the past five years, the Simoa NfL assay has been used in hundreds of published studies. In 2022, Simoa technology supported 35 scientific presentations at the 38th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), the world’s largest meeting dedicated to advancing research for multiple sclerosis. In 2021, Simoa technology supported 31 scientific presentations at ECTRIMS. In 2020, Simoa supported 42 presentations at ECTRIMS. At ECTRIMS in 2019, there were nearly 50 presentations in which our Simoa NfL assay was used. 
As an example, in one 2019 presentation, Novartis presented positive data from its Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies of its multiple sclerosis drug candidate, ofatumumab. One of the secondary endpoints included serum levels of NfL as measured using our Simoa NfL assay. Novartis presented data that showed that, starting at three months after initiation of ofatumumab treatment, and then at 12 and 24 months timepoints, patients given ofatumumab had significantly lower blood levels of NfL, compared to those in the comparator arm of teriflunomide treated patients.
In another ECTRIMS presentation in 2019, Roche presented retrospective data from its Phase III OPERA I, OPERA II and ORATORIO trials of its approved multiple sclerosis drug OCREVUS (ocrelizumab). In the data presented at ECTRIMS, it was shown that treatment with OCREVUS lowered blood NfL levels and increased the proportion of patients reaching healthy donor range for NfL in both relapsing multiple sclerosis and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Roche believes that this data helps advance the understanding of NfL as a potential biomarker of disease activity and for treatment monitoring and may provide insight into the neuroprotective effects of the drug.
In an article published by Bjornevik, et al. in JAMA Neurology in September 2019, researchers presented data that showed that levels of serum NfL, as measured by the Simoa NfL assay, were increased six years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis. The researchers concluded that these data indicate that multiple sclerosis may have a 

14



prodromal phase lasting several years and that neuroaxonal damage occurs during this phase, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.
In a study published in Science in January 2022, researchers leveraged Simoa’s ability to detect the NfL at ultra-low levels to show that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) increases susceptibility toward developing multiple sclerosis. Researchers of the study tested the hypothesis that multiple sclerosis is caused by EBV in a cohort comprising more than 10 million young adults on active duty in the U.S. military, 955 of whom were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis during their period of service. Risk of multiple sclerosis increased 32-fold after infection with EBV, but was not increased after infection with other viruses, including the similarly transmitted cytomegalovirus. Serum levels of NfL, a biomarker of neuroaxonal degeneration, increased only after EBV seroconversion, suggesting that EBV played a role in nerve cell damage.
In April 2022, the FDA granted our Simoa NfL plasma test Breakthrough Device designation as a prognostic aid in assessing the risk of disease activity in patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The test has shown promise to be used in conjunction with clinical, imaging and laboratory findings as an aid in identifying RRMS patients who are at lower or higher risk for relapse within four years. We believe this prognostic information could be clinically useful in tailoring the therapeutic approach to more effectively treat the disease.
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
TBIs lead to approximately five million individuals visiting emergency rooms per year in the United States alone, often with broad and inconclusive diagnosis. Current methods of TBI diagnosis involve CT scans that fail to diagnose approximately 90% of mild TBI. Simoa technology has demonstrated the sensitivity to identify relevant neurological biomarkers, such as NfL, tau, GFAP and UCH-L1, to more adequately address diagnosis of TBIs and overall brain health.
Leading researchers in neurology have used Simoa technology to study biomarkers in the blood of athletes after concussion in many high-impact sports. Simoa can measure critical neural biomarkers in blood that correlate repeated head trauma from both concussions and subconcussive events with poor patient outcomes, including the potential development of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which currently can only be diagnosed after death via a brain autopsy. A publication by a National Institute of Health researcher indicates that measuring tau in the blood with Simoa may help identify concussed individuals requiring additional rest before they can safely return to play.
Oncology
Our ultra-sensitive Simoa technology has the potential to detect increased levels of oncology biomarkers during the very early stages in disease development. Biomarkers can be useful tools for diagnostics, prognostics and predictive cancer detection. However, many traditional assay technologies can only detect these biomarkers after the disease has progressed and the patient has become symptomatic. Simoa’s highly sensitive detection capability may result in earlier detection, better monitoring and treatment and improved prognoses for patients. Additionally, Simoa technology has shown early promise as a liquid biopsy alternative to more invasive diagnostic procedures.
Cancer immunotherapy is a promising new area that is significantly affecting cancer remission rates. One challenge of immunotherapy approaches is that the elicited immune responses are not always predictable and can vary from person to person and protocol to protocol. There exists a significant need to develop biomarker tools to monitor these drugs and their effects. Circulating (serum and plasma) protein biomarkers have the potential to be used in the field of immuno-oncology to stratify patients, predict response, predict recurrence, reveal mechanism of action and monitor for adverse effects. One technical challenge facing the immuno-oncology drug development process has been the availability of immunoassays with sufficient sensitivity to measure immunomodulatory biomarkers directly in serum and plasma. We have developed a number of tumor biomarker and immune modulation assays (cytokines and chemokines) that can be used to monitor tumor proliferation and host immune response. In particular key immune regulatory cells (T-regs, dendritic cells, macrophages) secrete very low amounts of the protein Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and these levels cannot be reliably measured in serum and plasma using conventional, immunoassay technology, however they can be tracked with our Simoa IFN-gamma assay. Additionally, we have developed an ultra-sensitive assay for IL-6, which 

15



is one of the cytokines commonly measured for monitoring cytokine release syndrome as an adverse effect in immunotherapies. Several studies have shown that our ultrasensitive assays can be valuable tools for monitoring immuno-oncology drugs and protocols.
We also believe residual cancer cell detection post-surgery or post-treatment may significantly improve outcomes for a variety of cancer types, by helping identify and segment patients at a greater risk of reoccurrence post-surgery due to residual cancer. For example, we have developed an ultra-sensitive biomarker assay for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) that is over 1,000-fold more sensitive than conventional ELISA assays. This assay is the only currently available technology that can detect levels of PSA in blood samples of prostate cancer patients shortly following radical prostatectomy, and we and researchers from Johns Hopkins and NYU conducted a pilot study on the utility of this assay to predict recurrence of prostate cancer after this procedure. In this study, the blood of prostate cancer patients taken three to six months following a radical prostatectomy at least five years earlier was analyzed with Simoa. The majority of samples had PSA levels below the detectable limits of traditional PSA assays. Our Simoa technology, however, was able to detect and quantify PSA levels in all samples. As shown in the following graph, the study demonstrated that the PSA assay using our Simoa technology has the potential to be highly predictive of prostate cancer recurrence over a five-year period. This has the potential to be a powerful prognostic tool, and allowing adjuvant radiation treatment to be targeted only to the men who actually would benefit.

Inflammation
Inflammation underlies the response of the body to injury in a variety of diseases. Simoa assays can measure inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules in serum and plasma with unprecedented sensitivity. This has the potential to enable new discoveries into the role of inflammation in the biology of health and disease. Our Simoa technology measures low levels of inflammatory proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, that characterize a range of inflammatory diseases, including Crohn’s disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and neuro-inflammation. We believe the sensitivity of Simoa technology can provide a clearer picture of the underlying state of the immune response and disease progression.
Our Simoa technology also has the potential to be used by companies developing anti-inflammatory drugs to quantify the effect a drug has on a particular inflammatory cytokine and to monitor therapeutic efficacy. For example, we conducted a study in conjunction with the Mayo Clinic using our Simoa technology on patients with clinically active Crohn’s disease undergoing anti-TNF-α therapy with Remicade, Humira or Enbrel. As shown in the graph below, researchers were able to detect and quantify the TNF-α levels of the patients before and after treatment. These levels were all below the LoD of traditional immunoassays.

16



We believe that a better understanding of the inflammatory response will be critical to future opportunities for wellness screening and disease response monitoring. Anti-inflammatory drugs are expensive and can have serious side effects, such as increased risk of infection. By monitoring biomarkers indicative of response, clinicians may be able to adjust dose to reduce side effects or increase efficacy.
Infectious Disease
The ability to detect infectious disease biomarkers before the onset of an immune response, where a virus is most contagious and multiplying rapidly, is critical for controlling the spread of disease. We believe that our Simoa technology has the potential to have a significant impact in reducing the spread of infectious diseases by making early stage detection more specific and widely available.
Today, early detection of infectious disease is conducted using nucleic acid testing to detect the nucleic acid of the viral or bacterial organism because the levels of infectious disease specific antigens are too low in the early stage of disease to be detected by traditional immunoassay technology. However, the sensitivity of our single molecule detection capabilities enables the detection of extremely low levels of infectious disease specific antigens with sensitivity that can rival the use of nucleic acid testing in this application, without the potential biases inherent in amplification technologies, such as PCR.
For example, we have developed a simple Simoa assay with more than 4,000-fold greater sensitivity than conventional ELISA assays capable of detecting the HIV-specific antigen, p24. This Simoa p24 sensitivity matches the sensitivity of more expensive and complex nucleic acid testing methods. The following graph shows a comparison that we conducted in 2011 of the Simoa p24 assay with a commercially available nucleic acid testing method, as well as two commercially available p24 immunoassay methods for early detection of HIV infection. The Simoa p24 assay detects infection as early as the nucleic acid testing method (11 days from initial blood draw), and a full week before the earliest signs of infection by the conventional p24 immunoassay methods. This early detection of acute HIV infection can be critical for controlling the spread of HIV, as HIV is ten times more infectious in the acute phase.

17



In addition, we believe the detection of a specific protein is more relevant to the determination of the pathogenic effect than detection of the organism itself because someone may carry a pathogenic organism with no pathogenic effect. Researchers have demonstrated that Simoa technology can detect Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxins A and B with sensitivities similar to the PCR detection of the C. diff organism itself. Because the C. diff organism does not always produce toxins, PCR methods that detect the C. diff organism suffer from very high false positive rates, which may result in incorrect diagnoses and the overuse of antibiotics. We believe that using Simoa to detect the toxins rather than the organism has the potential to provide a higher level of sensitivity and specificity, greatly reducing false positives.
Cardiology
Heart disease and related cardiovascular ailments remain the leading cause of death in the United States, contributing to nearly one in four deaths in the United States, according to the CDC. A significant need remains for early prediction of heart attacks and other cardiac events. Simoa’s highly sensitive digital measurement capabilities have the potential to be used to predict early cardiac disease.

Instruments and Consumables
HD-X
We commercially launched our HD-X instrument in the second half of 2019. The HD-X is an upgraded version of the Simoa HD-1, our very first instrument, which was launched in January 2014. The HD-X was designed to deliver significant productivity and operational efficiency improvements, as well as greater user flexibility. The HD-X uses our Simoa bead-based technology and is the most sensitive automated multiplex protein detection platform commercially available. Assays for the HD-X are fully automated (i.e., from sample in to result out), and results for up to 66 samples are available in approximately one hour. Samples can be input into the instrument via 96-well microtiter plates or sample tubes where the system can multiplex and process tests in a variety of assay protocol configurations.

20



Specialized software controls the Simoa instrumentation, analyzes the digital images produced, and provides customers with detailed analysis of their samples, such as the concentration of multiple biological molecules. The HD-X software automates the processes for running the instrument and analyzing data from the user-defined protocols. Proprietary image analysis software is embedded in the system, which converts the raw images into signals for each biological molecule being analyzed within a sample. Data reduction software automatically converts those signals to concentrations for the different biological molecules.
By the end of 2022, approximately 79% of the HD installed base were HD-X instruments.
SR-X
We commercially launched the SR-X instrument in the fourth quarter of 2017. The SR-X utilizes the same Simoa bead-based technology and assay kits as the HD-X in a compact benchtop form with a lower price point designed to address the needs of researchers who value the ultra-sensitive detection capabilities enabled by Simoa.
In contrast to the fully automated workflow of the HD-X, the assay incubation and washing steps for the SR-X are performed outside of the instruments using conventional liquid handling methods. The offline sample prep provides additional flexibility to enable researchers to apply Simoa detection in an expanded range of applications including direct detection of nucleic acids. The SR-X system automates the steps loading Simoa beads onto Simoa disks with subsequent imaging, detection and data reduction. Processing time for imaging a 96 well plate is approximately 2.5 hours.
SP-X
We commercially launched the SP-X instrument in April 2019. The SP-X uses the Simoa planar array technology developed initially by Aushon Biosystems (Aushon), which we acquired in 2018, for multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay measurement, which we refined by leveraging our proprietary sophisticated Simoa image analysis and data analysis algorithms to provide sensitivity similar to that found in our Simoa bead-based platform. The Simoa planar array technology utilizes a 96-well microtiter plate with up to 10 different assay measurements performed in each well of the plate from as little as 12.5 microliters of sample.
Similar to the SR-X, the assay prep workflow utilized for the SP-X involves assay incubation and washing steps performed outside of the instrument using the same conventional liquid handling methods as the SR-X. The SP-X instrument automates the imaging, detection and data reduction process. Processing time for imaging a 96 well plate is less than five minutes.
Simoa Assays and Consumables
Recurring revenue is derived through the sale of consumables used to run assays on our instruments and from our growing menu of Simoa digital biomarker assays. The current menu of approximately 36 analyte-specific single-plex and multi-plex assay kits for our bead-based instruments includes assays for biomarkers in the areas of neurology, infectious disease, immunology and oncology for both human and mouse samples. The current menu of assay kits for the planar array instrument includes approximately 115 biomarkers ranging from 1-10 analytes per assay in the areas of immunology and oncology research.
In addition to these assays we have developed, both of the Simoa platforms allow ease and flexibility in assay design, enabling our customers to develop their own proprietary in-house assays, called homebrew assays, using our homebrew assay kits. These kits include all components required for customers to run tests using their own antibodies. Our consumables portfolio for our bead-based platform also includes our proprietary Simoa disks that are unique to our bead-based platform, as well as cuvettes and disposable tips. Our goal is to continue to add to our assay kits to extend our application base. 
We have staffed our assay development and manufacturing teams to do the upfront work of antibody sourcing, assay development and optimization, sample testing and validation, transfer to manufacturing and final documentation. 

21



We outsource some of our assay development activities to other antibody and/or assay development providers and expect to continue to do so to achieve our aggressive menu expansion goals.
NfL Antibodies and NfL ELISA Kits
Uman is our wholly owned subsidiary that supplies NfL antibodies and ELISA kits for NfL detection. Uman’s NfL antibodies are widely recognized by researchers and biopharmaceutical and diagnostics companies worldwide as the premier solution for the detection of NfL to advance the development of therapeutics and diagnostics for neurodegenerative conditions. Through Uman we sell proprietary NfL capture and detection antibodies, as well as two NfL ELISA kits for CSF, one of which is CE-certified in Europe and one RUO NfL ELISA kit for serum. 
Services
Through our Accelerator Laboratory, which includes a CLIA-certified laboratory, we provide customers a contract research option.

The Accelerator Laboratory supports multiple projects and services, including:

● | Sample testing. Utilizing commercially available Simoa kits, we have run large studies for customers with thousands of specimens and small experiments with just a few samples. The sample protocol can be tailored precisely to the customer’s needs and even large studies can be run quickly. We have extensive experience testing many different sample types where biomarkers may be present at very low levels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Homebrew assay development. Utilizing proprietary or commercially available reagents in combination with our Homebrew Assay Development Kit, we can rapidly develop a prototype assay exhibiting improved sensitivity compared to traditional ELISA. The Accelerator Laboratory can also be used to screen reagents to identify the optimal assay format or expand prototype efforts for further assay optimization or validation to ultimately deliver the highest level of performance.

● | Custom development. After identifying the optimal assay and conditions, the Accelerator Laboratory can be used to generate qualified bulk reagents or custom assay kits, providing customer access to validated kits for assays not yet commercially available on the Simoa platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | LDT Testing. We have recently begun offering LDT testing through our CLIA-certified laboratory. In July 2022, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure pTau-181 in plasma as an aid in diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease, and in January 2023, we launched an LDT to quantitatively measure NfL in serum as an aid in the evaluation of individuals for possible neurodegenerative conditions or other causes of neuronal or central nervous system damage. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To date, we have completed over 1,900 projects for more than 400 customers from all over the world using our Simoa platforms. In addition to being an important source of revenue, we have also found the Accelerator Laboratory to be a catalyst for placing additional instruments, as a number of customers for whom we have provided contract research services have subsequently purchased an instrument from us.
We also generate revenues through extended-warranty and service contracts for our installed base of instruments.
Research and Development
We continually seek to improve our platform and technology to enable more sensitive detection and measurement of biological molecules. This evaluation includes examining new assay formats and instrumentation improvements and upgrades to increase the performance of our Simoa assays and instruments. We also intend to selectively expand our assay menu to extend the scope of applications for our platform to biomarkers of significant 

22



interest to the scientific community. Our assay menu expansion is driven by a number of factors, including input from key opinion leaders, customer feedback, homebrew projects, Accelerator Laboratory projects, new publications on biomarkers of industry interest, and feedback from our sales and marketing team. We also intend to continue to develop and market new instruments with different and/or improved capabilities in order to further broaden our market reach.
Sales and Marketing
We distribute our Simoa instruments and consumables via direct field sales and support organizations located in North America and Europe and through a combination of our own sales force and third-party distributors in additional major markets, including Australia, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, India, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and UAE. In addition, we sell Uman’s NfL antibodies and NfL ELISA kits directly and in conjunction with a distributor worldwide. Our domestic and international sales force informs our current and potential customers of current product offerings, new product and new assay introductions, and technological advances in Simoa systems, workflows, and notable research being performed by our customers or us. As our primary point of contact in the marketplace, our sales force focuses on delivering a consistent marketing message and high level of customer service, while also attempting to help us better understand evolving market and customer needs.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 125 full-time employees in sales, sales support and marketing, including technical field application scientists and field service personnel. This staff is primarily located in North America and Europe. We expect we will expand our sales, support, and marketing efforts in the future by expanding our direct footprint in Europe as well as developing a comprehensive distribution and support network in China where significant new market opportunities exist. Additionally, we believe that there is significant opportunity in other Asia-Pacific region countries such as South Korea and Australia as well as in South America. We are expanding into these regions via initial penetration with distributors and then subsequent support with Quanterix-employed sales and support personnel.
Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at key opinion leaders, laboratory directors and principal investigators at leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and governmental research institutions.
In addition to our selling activities, we align with key opinion leaders at leading institutions and clinical research laboratories to help increase scientific and commercial awareness of our technologies, demonstrate the benefits relative to existing technologies and accelerate adoption. We also seek to increase awareness of our products through participation at trade shows, academic conferences, online webinars and dedicated scientific events attended by prominent users and prospective customers.
Our instruments require a capital investment by our customers. The sales process typically involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the instruments including running experiments in the Accelerator Laboratory and comparing results from competing systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be six to 12 months, or longer.
Manufacturing and Supply
We outsource the development and manufacturing of our Simoa bead-based instruments to third-party manufacturers, and we develop and manufacture our planar array instrument and all assay kits in our own facilities.
Instruments
The HD-X instrument is manufactured by STRATEC Biomedical AG (STRATEC), based in Birkenfeld, Germany, and is manufactured and shipped from their Birkenfeld and Beringen, Switzerland facilities. The SR-X is manufactured by Paramit Corporation (Paramit), based in Morgan Hill, California, and is shipped to our global customers by Paramit. See “—Key Agreements” for a description of our agreements with STRATEC and Paramit. 

23



Installation of, and training on, our instruments is provided by our employees in the markets where we conduct direct sales, and by distributors in those markets where we operate with distributors. 
We believe this manufacturing strategy is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for the HD-X or the SR-X, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed.
The SP-X instruments are manufactured, tested, shipped and supported by us from our Billerica, Massachusetts facility. All internal components are sourced domestically except one significant component that is sourced in Germany. These components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single-source suppliers. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply instruments on a timely basis.
Consumables
We assemble our assay kits for our bead-based platform in our Billerica, Massachusetts facility. Reagents for our bead-based assays include all components required to run an enzyme based immunoassay, such as beads, capture and detector reagents, enzyme reagents and enzyme substrate. These reagents are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single-source suppliers. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement reagents for our assay kits, which could negatively affect our ability to supply assay kits on a timely basis. In an effort to mitigate this risk through inventory control, we are working to increase the shelf life of our bead-based assays to 12 months or more.
Simoa disks for our bead-based platform are supplied through a single source supplier pursuant to a long-term supply agreement with STRATEC Consumables, a subsidiary of STRATEC Biomedical. We believe that this agreement provides for a sufficient notification period to allow for supply continuity and the identification and tech transfer to a new supplier in the event either party wishes to terminate the relationship. Our cuvettes for our bead-based platform are single sourced through STRATEC Biomedical, and the disposable tips used in our bead-based platform are commercially available.
We assemble our 96 well sample plate kits for our planar array platform in our Billerica, Massachusetts facility. Reagents for our planar array assays include all components required to run an enzyme-based chemiluminescent immunoassay, such as capture antibody printed plates and detector reagents, enzyme reagents and enzyme substrate. These reagents are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single-source suppliers. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement reagents for our assay kits, which could negatively affect our ability to supply assay kits on a timely basis. Because our planar array assays have a shelf life of 12 months, we believe we are able to mitigate this risk through inventory control.
NfL antibodies and NfL ELISA Kits
The storage of Uman’s proprietary NfL antibody producing hybridomas as well as the cultivation and purification of the antibodies is outsourced to a contract manufacturer, and bulk material of purified antibodies is delivered to Uman’s site in Umeå, Sweden. Functional testing and verification of concentration are performed at Uman before the material is approved for use in production activities. The antibodies can be aliquoted and sold as single reagents or used for the production of Uman’s NfL ELISA kits. The antibody reagents are labeled and released to market after testing. The contract manufacturer of antibodies is audited regularly, and we have entered into a written supply agreement with the contract manufacturer. The current shelf-life of the antibodies is 18 months.
All components in Uman’s NfL ELISA kits are manufactured in-house at Uman from starting materials sourced from suppliers that have been evaluated and approved. Uman has entered into supply agreements with critical suppliers. All incoming goods are subject to receipt control and any deviations related to quality deficiencies are registered. The kit components include buffers (sample diluents and wash solutions), ELISA 96-well plates coated with a capture antibody, detector antibodies, streptavidine conjugates, substrates (TMB) and stop reagents. The kit components are labeled (either RUO or CE) and assembled. The final ELISA kit products are subject to quality control procedures, which include 

24



testing of human CSF or human serum quality control samples to assure a high batch consistency. After testing and batch record review, the material is released to market. The current shelf-life of the kits is 18 months (NF-light ELISA (CSF)) or 13 months (NF-light Serum ELISA).
Key Agreements
Development Agreement and Supply Agreement with STRATEC
In August 2011, we entered into a Strategic Development Services and Equity Participation Agreement with STRATEC, pursuant to which STRATEC undertook the development of the Simoa HD instrument. In September 2011, we also entered into a Supply and Manufacturing Agreement with STRATEC (the STRATEC Supply Agreement), pursuant to which STRATEC agreed to supply HD instruments to us, and we agreed to procure those instruments exclusively from STRATEC, subject to STRATEC’s ability to supply the instruments. We are responsible for obtaining any regulatory approval necessary to sell the instruments. We agreed to purchase a certain number of instruments in the seven years following the acceptance of the first validation instrument. The STRATEC Supply Agreement was amended in November 2016 to reduce the number of HD instruments we were committed to procure from STRATEC, and this commitment has been met. The instrument price stipulated in the STRATEC Supply Agreement was established based on certain specified assumptions and is subject to certain adjustments.
The STRATEC Supply Agreement is terminable by either party on 12 months’ notice to the other party. The STRATEC Supply Agreement may also be terminated on the insolvency of a party or the uncured material breach of a party, or, by us, on a change of control of our company (subject to certain obligations to compensate STRATEC on such termination). On termination by us for STRATEC’s insolvency or uncured material breach or termination by STRATEC for convenience, we are granted a nonexclusive royalty free license of STRATEC intellectual property to manufacture the instruments. In certain of these circumstances, we could be obligated to issue warrants to purchase our common stock.
Paramit Manufacturing Services Agreement
In November 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (the Paramit Agreement) with Paramit. Under the terms of the Paramit Agreement, we engaged Paramit to produce and test our SR-X instrument on an as-ordered basis. We also engaged Paramit to supply spare parts for the SR-X instrument. Paramit has no obligation to manufacture our instrument without a purchase order and no obligation to maintain inventory in excess of any open purchase orders or materials in excess of the amount Paramit reasonably determines will be consumed within 90 days or within the lead time of manufacturing our instrument, whichever is greater. We have an obligation to purchase any material or instruments deemed in excess pursuant to the Paramit Agreement. The price is determined according to a mutually agreed-upon pricing formula. The parties agreed to review the pricing methodology yearly or upon a material change in cost.
The Paramit Agreement had an initial three-year term with automatic one year extensions. It is terminable by either party for convenience with written notice to the other party given at least nine months prior to the end of the then-current term. The agreement may also be terminated by us with three months’ notice to Paramit upon the occurrence of (i) a failure of Paramit to obtain any necessary governmental licenses, registrations or approvals required to manufacture our instrument or (ii) an assignment by Paramit of its rights or obligations under the agreement without our consent. The Paramit Agreement is terminable by Paramit with 30 days’ notice to us in the event of a material breach after written notice and a 60-day opportunity to cure the breach.
Competition
We compete with both established and development-stage life science companies that design, manufacture and market instruments for proteomics discovery and clinical research applications. For example, companies such as Bio-Techne, Luminex, MesoScale Discovery, Gyros, O-Link, SEER, Somalogic, MilliporeSigma, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and others, have products for protein measurements in biofluids that compete in certain segments of the market in which we sell our products. Our Accelerator Laboratory competes with other research 

25



laboratories such as Covance, Q2 Solutions, Rules Based Medicine, Monogram Biosciences, PPD Laboratories, and others, some of whom are customers of ours. In addition, as we or our partners expand the applications for our products to include diagnostics, we expect to compete with companies such as Siemens, Abbott, Roche, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Furthermore, our technology and products are showing promise for non-invasive early disease detection, and in the future, we could experience competition from companies that develop and market imaging and other molecular detection technologies. In addition, a number of other companies and academic groups are in the process of developing novel technologies for the life science research and diagnostic markets. Many of the companies with which we compete or will compete have substantially greater resources than we have.
The life science instrumentation and lab services industries are highly competitive and expected to grow more competitive with the increasing knowledge gained from ongoing research and development. We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets include:

● | sensitivity;
--+-------------


● | cost of instruments and consumables;
--+-------------------------------------


● | assay menu;
--+------------


● | reputation among customers and key opinion leaders;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | innovation in product offerings;
--+---------------------------------


● | accuracy and reproducibility of results; and
--+---------------------------------------------


● | customer support infrastructure.
--+---------------------------------

We believe that we are well positioned with respect to these competitive factors and expect to enhance our position through ongoing global expansion, innovative new product introductions and ongoing collaborations and partnerships with key opinion leaders.
Intellectual Property 
Our core Simoa bead-based technology, directed to general methods and devices for single molecule detection, originated at Tufts University (Tufts), in the laboratory of Professor David Walt, who is the founder of Quanterix and a current member of our Board of Directors. Prof. Walt and his students pioneered the single molecule array technology, including technologies that enabled the detection of single enzyme labels in arrays of microwells, thereby facilitating the ultra-sensitive detection of proteins, nucleic acids, and cells. We have exclusively licensed from Tufts the relevant patent filings related to these technologies. (See “—License Agreement with Tufts University” below). In addition to licensed patents, we have developed our own portfolio of issued patents and patent applications directed to commercial products and technologies for potential development. Our portfolio also includes issued patents and patent applications acquired as part of our 2018 acquisition of Aushon Biosystems. We believe our proprietary platforms are a core strength of our business and our strategy includes the continued development of our patent portfolio.
Our patent strategy is multilayered, providing coverage of aspects of the core technology as well as specific uses and applications, some of which are reflected in our current products and some of which are not. The first layer is based on protecting the fundamental methods for detecting single molecules independent of the specific analyte to be detected. The second layer covers embodiments of the core technology directed to the detection of specific analytes. The third layer protects novel instrumentation, consumables, and manufacturing processes used in applying the invention to certain commercial products or future product opportunities. The fourth layer is concerned with specific uses of the core technology (e.g., biomarkers and diagnostics). Our patent strategy is both offensive and defensive in nature, seeking to protect not only technology we currently practice but also alternative, related embodiments.

License Agreement with Tufts University
In June 2007, as amended in April 2013, August 2017, and September 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Tufts, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, commercialize, use, make, or have made, import or have imported, distribute or have distributed, offer or have offered, and sell or have sold products and services covered by patent rights to the Simoa bead-based technology owned by Tufts, as well as a non-exclusive license to related know-how. The rights licensed to us are for all fields of use and are sublicensable for a fee.
Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront fee and issued Tufts shares of our common stock. In addition, in connection with the April 2013 amendment, we issued Tufts shares of our Series C-1 Preferred Stock, which converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We are required to pay Tufts low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products and services that use the licensed technology, as well as a portion of any sublicensing revenues. We are also obligated to pay annual maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us, and a milestone payment upon any sublicense by us. We were also required to reimburse Tufts for all patent prosecution cost incurred prior to the agreement and for all future patent prosecution costs.
The term of the license agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis so long as there is a valid claim of a licensed patent in such country. Tufts may terminate the agreement or convert to a non-exclusive license in the event (1) we fail to pay any undisputed amount when required and fail to cure such non-payment within 60 days after receipt of notice from Tufts, (2) we are in breach of any material provision of the agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after receipt of notice from Tufts, (3) we do not demonstrate diligent efforts to develop a product incorporating the licensed technology, (4) we are found on five separate audits to have underpaid pursuant to the terms of the agreement, (5) we cease to carry on the business related to the licensed technology either directly or indirectly, or (6) we are adjudged insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or have a petition in bankruptcy filed for or against us that is not removed within 60 days. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 60 days’ written notice. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights revert to Tufts.Government Regulation 
The majority of our products are currently intended for research use only (RUO) applications, although our customers may use our products to develop their own products that are subject to regulation by the FDA or the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Although most in vitro diagnostic products intended for RUO are not currently required to obtain premarket clearance or approval by the FDA, products labeled as RUO are subject to the FDA’s premarket review requirements if they are determined to be intended for use for clinical rather than research purposes. Consequently, other than our two laboratory developed tests intended for clinical testing, our products are labeled and intended “For Research Use Only. Not for Diagnostic Procedures.”
The FDA has issued Final Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” (the RUO/IUO Guidance). The purpose of an FDA guidance document is to provide the FDA’s current thinking on when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO or for investigational use only (IUO) and when products labeled RUO or IUO will be viewed by the FDA as intended for clinical use, but as with all FDA guidance documents, this guidance does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities and should be viewed as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory 

29



requirements are cited. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the device from the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process (510(k)), premarket approval, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. Although the RUO/IUO Guidance was not intended as a compliance requirement, we believe that our labeling and promotion of our products, including the custom assay RUO products developed by the Accelerator Laboratory, is consistent with the RUO/IUO Guidance because we have not promoted our products for clinical use in humans. 
IVD tests intended for clinical diagnostic use are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, however, the FDA has traditionally not regulated certain laboratory tests referred to as laboratory developed tests (LDTs) (as discussed further below). The FDA defines a medical device in part as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. This means that the FDA will regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of our clinical IVD devices (other than our LDTs) and we will be required to register as a medical device manufacturer and list our marketed products.
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards and guidance documents setting out labeling and testing requirements. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval, including any conditions imposed as part of the approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification (510(k)) and receive clearance from the FDA, which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for Class I and Class II devices that are not exempt. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application (PMA) is submitted to and approved by the FDA. Novel devices that have not been classified require either approval of a PMA or FDA review of a de novo classification request before they can be marketed.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance for Class I and Class II devices that are not exempt, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent (SE) to a predicate device legally marketed in the U.S. for which a PMA was not required. Substantial equivalence means that the device has the same intended use as the predicate device and either (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or (b) has different technological characteristics but does not raise difference questions of safety and effectiveness and information in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as the predicate. The FDA is supposed to make a SE determination within 90 days of the FDA’s receipt of the 510(k), but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval.
Premarket Approval Pathway
A PMA must be submitted if a new device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the 

30



FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the accepted application, although review of the application generally can take between one and three years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with its quality system regulations (QSRs). New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose.
However, a de novo classification request allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA), a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo classification request, but the review often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Emergency Use Authorization
​
In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.
Under this authority, the FDA may issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for an unapproved device if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence of effectiveness of the device exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition. Evidence of effectiveness includes medical devices that “may be effective” to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease or condition identified in a declaration of emergency issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The “may be effective” standard for EUAs requires a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard that FDA uses for product approvals in non-emergency situations. The FDA assesses the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis. In determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, the FDA examines the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to) results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, in vitro data, as well as the quality and quantity of the available evidence.

31



Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of HHS that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product.
The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are usually required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k) or a de novo classification request. In the U.S., if the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption (IDE) application and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. Non-significant risk device studies do not require FDA approval of an IDE application. Both significant risk and non-significant risk clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an institutional review board (IRB). The clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations and good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA, the sponsor or an IRB at its institution at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. Clinical trials are also subject to a requirement to submit certain information to the ClincialTrials.gov database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
​
Breakthrough Device Designation
FDA Breakthrough Device designation is granted to certain medical devices and device-led combination products that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The goal is to give patients and doctors timely access to these medical devices by speeding up their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the statutory standards for premarket approval. The Breakthrough Devices Program offers device companies an opportunity to interact with the FDA's experts through several different program options to efficiently address topics as they arise during the premarket review phase, which can help companies receive feedback from the FDA and identify areas of agreement in a timely way. Recipients may also receive prioritized review of their submission. Although Breakthrough Device designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or clearance/authorization/approval process, it is not guaranteed to do so, and, more importantly, it does not change the standards for clearance/authorization/approval. Designation for any expedited review procedure does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory clearance or approval for such product.
FDA Enforcement
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include among other things:

● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

32




● | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, Regulation of LDTs and State Regulation
We own and operate a CLIA-certified laboratory. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) are federal regulatory standards that apply to all clinical laboratory testing performed on humans in the United States (with the exception of research testing that does not report patient specific results). A clinical laboratory is defined by CLIA as any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens obtained from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of health of, human beings. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services.
In addition, CLIA requires certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program for each of the specialties and subspecialties for which it is certified. If a laboratory fails to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test, then its CLIA certificate may be suspended, limited or revoked, or other sanctions may be imposed.
As a condition of CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every other year (except laboratories with only a certificate of waiver or certificate of provider-performed microscopy procedures are not subject to biennial inspections), in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or a CMS-approved accreditation organization.
High complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories, such as ours, frequently develop testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers. These tests have been traditionally offered by high-complexity laboratories for the last few decades as LDTs, the validation and performance of which are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA also has claimed that it has regulatory authority over LDTs under the agency’s medical device authorities, but has not exercised enforcement with respect to most LDTs offered by high complexity laboratories, and not sought to require these laboratories to comply with FDA regulations regarding medical devices. In 2010, the FDA announced that it had decided to exercise regulatory authority over these LDTs, and that it planned to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach. At that time, the FDA indicated that it would use a risk-based approach to regulation and would direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury, but that it would be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation. To date, the FDA has not issued such guidance, and has indicated that Congress should enact legislation to address improved oversight of diagnostics, 

33



including LDTs, rather than the FDA addressing the issue through administrative proposals. However, FDA has increased its oversight of what it perceived as especially high-risk LDTs, and in October 2018 the FDA issued a safety communication warning against the use of unapproved LDTs that describe relationships between gene variants and particular drugs (pharmacogenomic tests). FDA also regulated LDTs for Covid-19 under its EUA authority and related guidance. HHS initially issued a policy in August 2020 stating that FDA could not require premarket review (including EUAs) for LDTs. But this HHS policy was revoked in November 2021, reinstating FDA's prior approach for oversight of Covid-19 LDTs. Thus, while FDA generally exercises enforcement discretion for LDTs it continues to exercise oversight over certain high-risk tests. In addition, over the past several years, several bills to impose a new FDA regulatory framework with similarities to the current medical device framework for “in vitro clinical tests,” which would include both in vitro diagnostics and LDTs, have been introduced. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any such legislation or future FDA guidance or regulation or their potential impact. Any new regulatory approach for LDTs by the FDA, whether through legislation or regulation, would likely lead to an increased regulatory burden, including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests. While the ultimate impact of any changes to the FDA’s current approach is unknown, it may be extensive and may result in significant change.
In addition, some states require that any laboratory be licensed by the appropriate state agency in the state in which it operates. Laboratories must also hold state licenses or permits, as applicable, from various states including, but not limited to, California, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Maryland, to the extent that they accept specimens from one or more of these states, each of which requires out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure.
If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories or with CLIA, it may be subject to enforcement actions that may include suspension, limitation or revocation of the license or CLIA certificate, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. Loss of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate or state license may also result in the inability to receive payments from state and federal health care programs as well as private third-party payors.
When we perform clinical diagnostic testing, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as well as additional federal and state laws that impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories.

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of our product for clinical diagnostic use in those countries. The regulations in other jurisdictions vary from those in the U.S. and may be easier or more difficult to satisfy and are subject to change. For example, in the European Union (the E.U.) new regulations recently entered into force that introduce greater regulation of medical devices and IVDs. The new IVD regulation (the IVD Regulation) is significantly different from the European directive for IVD medical devices (the IVD Directive) that it replaces in that it ensures that the new requirements apply uniformly and on the same schedule across the member states, includes a risk-based classification system and increases the requirements for conformity assessment. 
The CE registration for the Nf-L ELISA assay kit of our subsidiary Uman was approved in March 2014 under the IVD Directive. Under the IVD Directive, the assay is classified as a general IVD product and required self-certification with no involvement of a notified body/authority. The IVD Regulation introduces a new classification system for IVDs and assessment by a notified body is required for class B, C and D products. Uman’s Nf-L ELISA assay kit is classified as a class B product and must fully comply with (and have a CE mark issued under) the IVD Regulation by May 2027. The new requirements include an ISO 13485 certification of the quality system (which Uman received in July 2018) and increased technical evidence and follow-up of performance of the specific product (e.g., clinical evidence and post-market activities). The work to evaluate and to meet the new technical requirements is on-going. When all requirements are met, a notified body will be contacted, and the certification initiated. 
The NF-light Serum ELISA is currently sold only as a RUO product (not intended for diagnostic use). Work is on-going to prepare a technical file compliant with the IVD Regulation for this product as well.

Other Governmental Regulation
Privacy and Data Security Laws and Regulations
As a business with a global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in privacy and data security has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.
For example, in the U.S., the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, international and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. Privacy and Security Rules under HIPAA, as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by “Covered Entities,” (which are health care providers that submit electronic claims, health plans, and health care clearinghouses) and by their “Business Associates” (which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a Covered Entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the Covered Entity’s workforce). Rules under HIPAA and HITECH include specific security standards and breach notification requirements. HHS (through the Office of Civil Rights) has direct civil enforcement authority against Covered Entities and Business Associates with regard to both the Security and Privacy Rules. The U.S. Department of Justice has criminal enforcement authority against Covered Entities, Business Associates, and certain other entities and individuals. In addition, State Attorneys General may being enforcement actions under HIPAA. Generally Quanterix is not a Covered Entity, however, we may operate as a Business Associate to Covered Entities under certain circumstances. 
In addition to the regulation of personal health information, a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers, or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers.
Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in foreign countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., stringent data protection and privacy rules which substantially impact the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies uniformly across the E.U. and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the E.U. to comply with E.U. privacy and data protection rules.
Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities.
Environmental Health and Safety Laws

35



We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. OSHA also regulates the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Likewise, we are subject to EPA and state requirements relating to the management and disposal of hazardous waste, and state requirements relating to the disposal of regulated medical waste. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials that we may use during our research.

As of December 31, 2022, we had 370 full-time employees, of which 125 work in sales, sales support, field service, and marketing, 85 work in engineering and research and development, 104 work in manufacturing and operations and 56 work in general and administration. Of our 370 full-time employees, 309 were located in the United States and 61 were located in 11 foreign countries. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have a unique culture that stresses the impact our work has on the eradication of human diseases. We invest in creating a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment where our employees can deliver their workplace best every day.
Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical employees. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, and we seek to cultivate a superior pool of talent by providing career growth, on-the-job learning opportunities and competitive compensation. We are committed to an inclusive culture which values equality, opportunity and respect. In support of our inclusive culture, we sponsor an internal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee comprised of employees and executives, provide respectful workplace training to strengthen employee understanding and consciously strive to recruit a diverse talent pool across all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 44% of our employees were women and approximately 36% were non-white. 
Workforce Compensation and Pay Equity
We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. We provide our full-time employees with highly competitive salaries, as well a bonus and/or commission plan, a matching 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off and family leave. We also provide all of our employees with targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions designed to facilitate retention through the opportunity to benefit financially from our growth and profitability.
Company Culture
We expect all of our employees and contractors to observe the highest levels of business ethics, integrity, mutual respect, tolerance and inclusivity. Our employee handbook and Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics set forth policies reflecting these values and also provide direction for registering complaints in the event of any violation of our policies. An “open door” policy is maintained at all levels of the organization, and any form of retaliation against an employee is strictly prohibited.
Employee Engagement and Wellness
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the physical and mental well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees and contractors. We provide our 

36



employees with a wide range of benefits, including benefits directed to their health, safety and long-term financial security.
