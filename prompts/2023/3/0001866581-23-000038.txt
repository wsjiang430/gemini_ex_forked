ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Dutch Bros Inc. is a Delaware corporation and its Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BROS”. 
OUR COMPANY
Dutch Bros is a high growth operator and franchisor of drive-thru shops that focus on serving high QUALITY, hand-crafted beverages with unparalleled SPEED and superior SERVICE. Founded in 1992 by brothers Dane and Travis Boersma, Dutch Bros began with a double-head espresso machine and a pushcart in Grants Pass, Oregon. Today, we believe that Dutch Bros is one of the fastest-growing brands in the foodservice and restaurant industry in the United States by location count. As of December 31, 2022, we had 671 shops, of which 396 were company-operated and 275 were franchise, across 14 states as shown in the graphic below. For additional information regarding company-operated and franchise shops by state, refer to Part I, Item 2 Properties of this Form 10-K.

The Dutch Bros Experience

Dutch Bros is more than just the products we serve: we are dedicated to making differences in the lives of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. Our people are the key to our success, and our broistas are the face of Dutch Bros, delivering on the Company’s core values of QUALITY, SPEED, and SERVICE.

•QUALITY: Our broistas are provided with the resources and training to provide high-quality hand-crafted beverages to our customers. 
•SPEED: When our shops are busy, a “runner” broista leaves the shop and greets our customers before they reach the drive-thru window. This runner explains the menu and helps customers personalize their orders. Using tablets, our runners take orders, sending them to broistas inside the shop, who utilize our flexible systems to handcraft custom beverages. This system, in combination with “escape lanes” that allow customers to receive their drinks and exit before reaching the window if their drinks are ready, helps our team manage throughput all day. 
•SERVICE: We embrace a customer-first attitude and use every interaction during the drive-thru experience to connect with our customers and strive to deliver an experience that exceeds our customers’ expectations. 
The combination of hand-crafted and high-quality beverages, our unique drive-thru experience and our community-driven, people-first culture has allowed us to successfully open new shops and continue to share the “Dutch Luv”. To achieve these experiences and create meaningful differentiation in our industry, we and our franchise partners are committed to attracting and retaining broistas who go all out to deliver an experience that exceeds our customers’ expectations, every day. We empower our broistas to take the extra step to make each customer interaction remarkable. 
Our Menu
We sell a wide range of customizable hot, iced, and blended beverages. 
•Coffee: coffee-based beverages make up ~50%1 of our menu mix. Coffee-based beverages include our espresso-based custom drinks, cold brew, and our proprietary “Freeze” blended beverages. Our Private Reserve coffee is a 100% Arabica three-bean blend, roasted in our Grant’s Pass facility. In our shops, we utilize premium La Marzocco machines to extract the coffee and deliver shots of smooth, full-bodied espresso.
•Energy: ~25%1 of our menu mix is based upon our proprietary Blue Rebel energy drink, which is highly customizable with flavors and modifiers and can be served blended or over ice. Our energy platform helps unlock the afternoon daypart and helps us appeal to a diverse customer base.
•Other: the remaining ~25%1 of our menu mix is a wide variety of teas, lemonades, sodas, and smoothies.

 Dutch Bros Inc.| Form 10-K |

Customers are encouraged to explore our robust “secret” menu and customize beverages through the addition of flavors and other modifiers. Many of our customers add “soft-top,” a sweet, creamy whipped topping that can be added to almost any order. High-levels of customization encourage innovation, creating a competitive moat and helping drive a broad demographic appeal.

Our Dutch Rewards Loyalty Program

In February 2021, we released our app-based digital loyalty program (Dutch Rewards) which has grown to 5.2 million registered members as of December 31, 2022.We utilize Dutch Rewards to interact directly with our customers, applying 1:1 marketing to offer targeted messaging, offers, and rewards that enhance the Dutch Bros experience. Dutch Rewards uses a spend-based model, where customers collect points that can be redeemed for rewards. These rewards can be utilized to receive free drinks or shared with others. Points and rewards generally expire after six months.

Further, we offer members the ability to preload funds on their account and pay through our app, a function we call Dutch Pass. In addition to being convenient for customers, Dutch Pass enables us to increase our speed of service by reducing the payment collection time. Our Dutch Pass functionality also allows users to purchase and share digital gift cards, providing more customers the opportunity to share in the Dutch Bros Experience. 
Our Shops
We are a drive-thru focused business: over 90% of our business is conducted through the drive-thru. We believe that our drive-thru business model places a premium on customer convenience without sacrificing the personal experience. Our shops and our real estate strategy are designed from the ground up to support the drive-thru business.
Our shops typically have a smaller footprint than other drive-thru formats - our shops are typically 865 to 950 square feet. This compact footprint allows us greater flexibility to place locations on more parcels. We typically target lots that are at least 25,000 square feet to handle substantial car volume. Except for a handful of legacy “coffee houses”, all our shops deploy either a single or double drive-thru window with multiple feeder lanes for traffic flow. Most of our shops also have walk-up ordering windows and “escape lanes” that enable customers to exit the line after a runner delivers their drink before reaching the window, helping increase throughput and reducing congestion. For illustration of our shop model, see the graphic below.

Our Long-Term Franchise Partners
Historically, we used a franchising strategy alongside company-operated shop development to drive growth in select markets. Over time, as we decided to grow more from within, we only offered franchise partnership opportunities to the highest-quality employees within our network. In 2008, we stopped selling franchises to people that did not come from within our system. In 2017, we shifted to a company-operated strategy with all operators recruited from within our system. While we maintain great relationships with our existing franchise partners and they continue to open new shops as they look to infill their high-demand markets, we anticipate approximately 90% of new shops we open each year will be company-operated shops. 
OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES TO SHARE THE “DUTCH LUV”
We are in the early stages of our growth story. We will expand our business to positively impact our communities through the following growth strategies:

 | Develop our People, Who are our Growth Capital
•100% of our Regional Operators began their Dutch Bros journey as broistas. We must attract and retain great people at the top of our funnel to sustain long-term growth. 
•Provide robust internal training and career advancement programs, which help develop a high-quality talent pool of candidates seeking larger roles within the Company. 
•Maintain the Dutch Bros culture as we scale. We design our people systems with culture in mind, enabling us to continue making a positive impact in new communities and providing career development opportunities for employees.


 | Place Shops Wherever People Want Great Beverages
•Target 4,000 total shop addressable market (TAM)1 within the next 10-15 years. Maintain and grow people development systems and new shop pipeline, which is fully-populated for 2023. 
•Utilize “fortressing” strategy to rapidly build scale within markets by proactively opening new shops. We believe this strategy improves customer experience and promotes long-term brand loyalty by alleviating capacity constraints and reducing barriers for increased customer frequency.

 Dutch Bros Inc.| Form 10-K |

 | Increase Brand Awareness and Encourage Deeper Customer Engagement
•Engage through social media platforms, prioritizing social impact and developing deep connections withing the communities we serve. 
•Utilize targeted in-app marketing promotions and grassroots campaigns. We believe the Dutch Rewards program enables us to serve customers unique beverage-focused content, information related to our social impact initiatives and new ways to engage with Dutch Bros.
•Leverage strong word-of-mouth advocacy, one of the strongest drivers of Dutch Bros brand awareness. Our commitment to our people encourages them to become enthusiastic brand ambassadors, and we believe that their visible love for the brand is infectious. 


 | Utilize Digital Technology that Enhances the Employee and Customer Experience
•Meet customer speed expectations by investing in, and integrating technology. 
•Utilize technology to reduce friction in customer interactions, providing opportunities to create deeper connections and better service.
•Utilize data-driven insights to refine menu offerings, drive frequency, and increase guest spend. 


 | Expand Margins Through Operating Leverage
•Deploy a resourceful and flexible approach to product design and procurement, optimized for adaptability and scalability. 
•Invest in state-of-the-art roasting facility in Texas to support our expansion strategy and long-term supply chain requirements in a cost-advantaged manner. 
•Achieve structural selling, general, and administrative cost leverage as our selling, general and administrative costs grow at a slower rate than our shop base and revenue.

Operations
Sourcing and Supply Chain
We pride ourselves on the quality of our coffee. To ensure we are able to consistently deliver high-quality coffee across our 671 shops in our system, we are actively involved in the sourcing, roasting, packaging, and distribution of coffee beans to our and our franchise partners’ shops.
•We partner with third-party importers and exporters to purchase and import our green coffee beans. Through this relationship, we source high-quality coffee beans from across Central and South America. We typically purchase coffee contracts 18-24 months in advance of when we take physical delivery of the beans, allowing us to lock in pricing and to manage our input costs. This practice also allows us to be a good partner to our coffee producers, providing security of future business.
 Dutch Bros Inc.| Form 10-K |
•We currently roast all our coffee in our roasting facility in Grants Pass, Oregon. We roast our coffee bean varietals to specific profiles designed to highlight each of the coffee bean’s unique flavors and aromas. After the coffee beans are roasted, we blend them to create our signature Private Reserve espresso.
•We package and ship our Private Reserve, Decaf and White Coffee espresso blends to 14 distribution centers that supply all our company-operated and franchised locations.
We designed our supply chain to be flexible in response to changes in the market. On average, we typically have approximately four months of green coffee bean inventory stored at our two ports of entry in the United States or at our roasting facility in Grants Pass, Oregon. In the event of a supply disruption in any one of our production origins, we have identified alternate coffee beans with substantially similar flavor profiles that can be sourced and incorporated to produce our blend.
We have taken several steps to increase our diversity of supply and reduce transportation costs as we expand company-operated shops eastward within the United States. We broke ground on a second state-of-the-art coffee roasting facility in Texas. We anticipate the new roasting facility will be operational in 2024. 
We also manufacture our own proprietary Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel Energy Drink via a co-bottling and co-packaging relationship. Beginning in 2023, we anticipate beginning to distribute a portion of our Blue Rebel Energy drink, along with our cold brew coffee, via a “bag in a box” system for use in shop beverage taps. We believe this will help us reduce our dependence on aluminum cans. Additionally, in 2022 we hired an industry veteran as our first Vice President of Procurement to help support our supply chain initiatives as we continue to scale. 
Quality, Health, and Safety
We and our franchise partners strive to maintain a safe, healthy environment at each shop through the careful training and supervision of personnel and by following rigorous quality standards. Our Quality Assurance team informs, monitors, and reports on standards for preparation and cleaning, as well as inspects every shop in the system on a quarterly basis. As part of our people-first culture, the health of our employees is our highest priority, and we provide them with appropriate resources. 
Our commitment to beverage and food safety is strengthened through the direct relationship between our supply chain, culinary, and quality assurance teams. We review our supply partners’ material decisions regarding ingredients, and we reserve the right to conduct spot-checks. We examine each suppliers’ safety and quality records and verify insurance coverage. We believe that our established requirement for franchise partners to purchase certain supplies and equipment from approved vendors further enhances safety and quality within our system.
People
Our people are the driving force of our mission and are a fundamental driver of our success. One of the most important relationships we have is with our employees, who are key members of the communities we love and support. We attract and seek out potential employees by identifying people with a love for life, a natural ability to connect with folks from all walks of life, and most of all, a big smile!
As of December 31, 2022, we and our franchise partners have approximately 22,000 employees, of which 14,000 employees are in our company-operated shops and headquarters. The chart below provides the approximate percentage of systemwide employees by shop type and by state location:

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We are committed to DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) in our Company, at the window and in our communities, cultivating an inclusive environment of love, acceptance, and kindness. Our DEI commitment strives to ensure all customers, crews, and communities are welcomed, honored, and loved. We are actively working to develop a holistic DEI program that can be a resource for everyone we serve. The events of the past several years have offered another reminder of how critically important our efforts have become, and as a result we have taken real, meaningful steps toward advancement of our DEI program including, but not limited to, the following:
•hired three female executives in the past 18 months including our President, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief Technology Officer. In total, as of the filing of this Form 10-K, 50% of our executive leadership team is female;
 Dutch Bros Inc.| Form 10-K |
•appointed an additional female member to our Board of Directors in 2022. In total, as of the filing of this Form 10-K, 44% of our Board of Directors is female;

We are continually making enhancements to our total rewards program to attract and retain top talent as part of our expanding growth strategy. We offer a comprehensive suite of benefits to our broistas, shop management, and headquarters employees, such as:
•company-wide minimum wage of at least $10.00 per hour across all markets;

Leadership Pathways
We exclusively source regional operators, who we view as the linchpins of our field organization and lead between 3-7 shops at scale, from within our organization. For our continued growth, it is critical that we consistently train and develop new leaders. Our leadership development program outlines shop growth opportunities at all levels of the organization and furthers our philosophy of hiring and developing leaders from within. This program provides ample opportunities for our shop broistas to create their own pathway, which can be a mix of Path A and B, to reach their potential goals.

This leadership program develops a pipeline of home-grown talent, which we believe will be sufficient for our new shop growth over the next several years. 
Planet
We aim to be good stewards of all that is available to us. We have committed to various initiatives to reduce our impact on the planet and its resources, such as: 
•purchased renewable energy credits to offset approximately all of our electricity usage at headquarters buildings and company-operated shops; 
•improved instrument cleaning process to reduce the number of water-consuming “dipper wells” required in our new shops; 
•began testing a beverage tap system for cold brew and Blue Rebel, which will reduce pallet size and weight with liquid not shipped;
•utilized modular construction, which reduces construction material waste and raw material inventory; and 
•broke ground on our new roasting facility in Texas, which will help reduce our transportation costs and carbon emissions impact.

Philanthropy
Since our inception, we have been dedicated to giving back to the communities in which we serve, and we consider our brand to be a powerful platform for social impact. Our philanthropic efforts support local and national causes. A culture of philanthropy and giving back to build better communities permeates the entire Dutch Bros organization, energizing both our broistas and customers alike.
We host three company-wide givebacks days each year. The Company, along with our franchise partners and Dutch Bros Foundation (the Foundation) provide donations for funds raised in each of these giveback days.

“Dutch Luv” | “Drink One for Dane” | “Buck for Kids” 
Every February, we donate $1 from every drink sold to local organizations working to fight food insecurity in our communities. | Every May, in honor of our co-founder Dane Boersma, we raise funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association to find a cause and cure for ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), or Lou Gehrig’s disease. | Every September, we dedicate a day to give $1 from every drink sold to nonprofit organizations helping create brighter futures for local kids.
2022 Donations 
More than $0.8 million | More than $2.3 million | More than $1.1 million 

Additionally, our operators and franchise partners are empowered to create their own local, shop-specific giveback programs that help support and build relationships within their communities. In addition to the 2022 donations noted above, the Company, along with our franchise partners and the Foundation donated more than $2.0 million in 2022 to various organizations through our local giveback days. 
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and our shops compete on a variety of factors, including convenience, taste, price, quality, service, and location. We believe our primary competitors include national and regional coffee chains, local specialty coffee shops, regional drive-thru coffee chains, and drive-thru quick service restaurants with coffee and other beverage programs. Our competitors operate company-operated, franchised, and mixed business models. In addition, due to our proprietary Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel energy beverages, we also compete with convenience stores.
Intellectual Property
We own many registered trademarks and service marks in the United States, the most important of which might be our trademarked Windmill logo. Other important trademarks include our “Dutch Bros,” “Dutch Bros Coffee,” “Dutch Bros Rebel,” and “Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel” word marks and our recognizable Dutch Bros sign logo. We believe the Dutch Bros name and the many distinctive marks associated with it are of significant value and are very important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we pursue registration and monitor the use of our marks in the United States and challenge any unauthorized use.
 Dutch Bros Inc.| Form 10-K |
We license the use of our marks to franchise partners, third-party vendors and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements and licensing agreements. These agreements typically restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements, and require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.
We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to, among others, nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements, food safety regulations, local licensure, building and zoning regulations, employment regulations, and laws and regulations related to our licensed operations. New laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high, are likely to increase in the future, and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. See "Regulatory and Legal Risks" in Item 1A, Risk Factors for more information.
We are not aware of any federal, state, or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our results of operations, competitive position, or capital expenditures.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that impact our revenue and company-operated shop gross profit margins. We typically experience higher nominal system sales in the summer months, which impacts revenue and company-operated shop gross profit margins in our second and third quarters of our fiscal year.
