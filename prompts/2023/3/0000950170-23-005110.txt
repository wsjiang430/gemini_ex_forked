 Item 1. Business.
 Our Company
 First Advantage is a leading global provider of employment background screening and verification solutions. We deliver innovative services and insights that help our customers manage risk and hire the best talent. Enabled by our proprietary technology, our products help companies protect their brands and provide safer environments for their customers and their most important resources: employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers.
 We manage one of the earliest and most important interactions between an applicant and our customer. Indeed, most applicants view their screening experience as a reflection of the hiring organization and its onboarding process. Our comprehensive product suite includes criminal background checks, drug / health screening, extended workforce screening, biometrics and identity, education / work verifications, resident screening, fleet / driver compliance, executive screening, data analytics, continuous monitoring, social media monitoring, and hiring tax incentives. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from pre-onboarding screening and perform screens in over 200 countries and territories, enabling us to serve as a one-stop-shop provider to both multinational companies and growth companies. In 2022, we performed over 100 million screens on behalf of approximately 33,000 customers spanning the globe and all major industry verticals, which includes 235 Enterprise customers at the end of 2022, up from 189 at the end of 2021. We often have multiple stakeholders within our customers, including Executive Management, Human Resources, Talent Acquisition, Compliance, Risk, Legal, Safety, and Vendor Management, who rely on our products and solutions.
 Our long-standing, blue-chip customer relationships include six of the U.S.’s top ten private sector employers, over 50% of the Fortune 100, and approximately one-third of the Fortune 500. We seek to grow market share by focusing on fast-growing industries and companies, increasing our share with existing customers, upselling and cross-selling new products and solutions, and winning new customers.
Our verticalized go-to-market strategy delivers highly relevant solutions for targeted industry sectors. This approach enables us to build a diversified customer portfolio and effectively serve many of the largest, most sophisticated, and fastest-growing companies in the world. We have built a powerful and efficient customer-centric sales model fueled by frequent engagement with our customers and deep subject matter expertise in industry-specific compliance and regulatory requirements, which allows us to create tailored solutions and drive consistent upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Our sales engine is powered by dedicated Sales and Solutions Engineering professionals working alongside Customer Success team members who have successfully maintained high customer satisfaction, retention, and growth, as evidenced by our industry-leading NPS, average 13-year tenure of our top 100 customers, and gross retention rate of approximately 97% as of December 31, 2022. Our go-to-market strategy continues to drive particular strength with Enterprise customers in sectors with attractive secular trends such as e-commerce, retail, transportation, warehousing, healthcare, and staffing.
 We have designed our technology to be highly configurable, scalable, and extensible. Our platform is embedded in our customers’ core enterprise workflows and interfaces with more than 75 third-party Human Capital Management (“HCM”) software platforms, including Applicant Tracking Systems (“ATS”), providing us with real-time visibility and input into our customers’ human resources processes. We leverage our proprietary internal databases—which include more than 690 million criminal, education, and work history observations as of December 31, 2022—and an extensive and highly curated network of more than 935 automated and/or integrated third-party data providers. These data providers include federal, state, and local government entities; court runners; drug and health testing labs and collection sites; credit bureaus; and education and work history data providers. Our platform efficiently and intelligently integrates data from these proprietary internal databases as well as external data sources using automation, APIs, and machine learning. Our investments in robotic process automation (“RPA”), including more than 3,000 bots currently deployed, enable our rapid turnaround times. For example, in 2022 alone, over 92% of our criminal searches in the United States were completed within one day. Our platform prioritizes data privacy and compliance and is powered by a rigorous, automated compliance rules engine. This enables us to address each customer’s unique requirements in an efficient and automated manner while also ensuring compliance with complex data usage guidelines and regulatory requirements across global jurisdictions and industry-specific regulatory frameworks.
 Our focus on innovative products and technologies has been critical to our growth. Using agile software development methodologies, we have consistently enhanced existing products and been early to market with new and innovative products, including offerings for biometrics and identity, continuous criminal monitoring, extended workforce screening, and instant oral drug testing. In addition, we continue to expand our proprietary internal databases that extend our competitive advantage, enhance turnaround times for customers, and offer potential future monetization upside opportunities. Our hundreds of millions of criminal, education, and work history records in our proprietary internal databases, amassed and curated over many years, accelerate screening turnaround times and reduce costs by using internal data sources before accessing third-party data sources or performing a manual verification.


Our Market Opportunity
 The importance of human capital and its associated risks to brand, reputation, safety, and compliance are ever-increasing in today’s interconnected, fast-paced world. Along with broader environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) considerations, these issues increasingly have become priorities at the highest executive and oversight levels of our customers worldwide. Key constituents, including C-Suite executives, boards of directors, external auditors, business owners, property managers, educators, volunteer organizations, and franchisors all face a heightened level of public scrutiny and accountability. Significant technological and societal trends include fraud and cyber-attacks; sexual harassment and workplace violence; and the prevalence of social media impacting companies’ brands. These have driven a significant increase in the need for screening, verifications, and ongoing monitoring. Our products and solutions are critical tools that companies depend on to provide safer environments for their customers and workers, maintain regulatory compliance, and protect their property, reputation, and brands.
 We believe several key trends are generating significant growth opportunities in our markets and increasing demand for our products and solutions:
 •Increased Workforce Mobility and Job Turnover: Millennials and Gen-Z represent a large, growing portion of the U.S. workforce and are more likely to change jobs than other generations in pursuit of earning higher wages, faster career development, and better workplace culture fit. Additionally, over the last two years, the economy has experienced an economic trend in which more employees are voluntarily resigning from their jobs and applying for new jobs, leading to more frequent job switching and an increase in employee churn. Many companies have moved to a remote or hybrid work environment, reducing the barriers to job entry, and we expect this trend to continue through 2023. In addition, as the economy evolves and resource needs differ significantly by sector, geography, and skill set, this is driving dynamism in the hiring environment.
 •Increasing Use of Contingent and Flexible Workforces: Contingent workers including freelancers, independent contractors, consultants, or other outsourced and non-permanent workers, comprise a significant portion of the U.S. workforce as corporations continue to increase their use of a flexible workforce. When independent contractors, external consultants, and temporary workers have access to sensitive information, company facilities, or directly interact with customers, it is important for companies to screen, verify, and monitor such flexible workforce personnel diligently.
 •C-Suite Focus on Safety and Reputational Risks: Screening, verifications, and compliance are mission-critical and are becoming boardroom priorities for many companies due to the brand risks and potential legal liability of hiring high-risk workers. A number of high-profile human capital-related issues have led to significant brand damage, diversion of management attention, litigation, and negative news and social media coverage for enterprises in recent years. These events reinforced the importance of our products and solutions. Companies are increasingly expanding human resources and compliance budgets on products and solutions that help manage their potential risks and improve safety. By enhancing workplace safety and helping companies manage risk, we help address important social factors affecting our customers.
 •Heightened Regulatory and Compliance Scrutiny: Businesses today are under intense scrutiny to comply with an ever-expanding and evolving set of global regulatory requirements that can vary by geography, industry vertical, and use case. Examples include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the “CCPA”), EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“U.K. GDPR”), and Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“IBIPA”), in addition to other anti-corruption requirements with respect to anti-money laundering and politically exposed persons. These requirements are driving many companies to perform more extensive and exhaustive checks and to partner with screening providers that have the scale, scope, heightened compliance standards, and auditability that they require. Our products and solutions help strengthen companies’ corporate governance through bolstering their compliance and risk management practices.
 •Development of International Markets: Background screening penetration remains low in most international geographies, with a large portion of screens conducted by unsophisticated, local providers. Multinational companies are increasingly focused on systematizing and elevating their human resources policies, screening procedures, and providers globally, driving greater demand and a shift towards technology-driven, high-quality, compliant, and global screening providers. In addition, many non-U.S.-based companies are initiating screening programs for the first time and are seeking reliable, compliant, and high-quality providers.
 •Growth in Post-Onboarding Monitoring: Companies are increasingly expanding their screening programs beyond a “one-and-done” pre-onboarding measure, which has historically been the norm in markets like the U.S. and U.K. We have invested in and continue to innovate our post-onboarding products and solutions and believe we are well-positioned to capture share in this growing market.


•Investment in Enterprise Software: Companies are increasingly investing in enterprise software to manage their businesses, including next-generation software-as-a-service solutions for HCM. As companies implement these systems, we believe there will be an increase in demand for screening, verification, and compliance solutions that can interface with these systems in an automated fashion to provide a seamless applicant and user experience and insights based on data analytics which we are able to provide through our product suite.
 •Proliferation of Relevant Data Sources: U.S. government agencies, third-party vendors, and professional organizations are increasingly tracking and improving the quality and digitization of data in areas such as criminal, education, income history, healthcare credentials, and motor vehicle records (“MVRs”). In many other countries with limited quality and availability of reliable data, the collection and organization of higher quality datasets has been increasing. This increasing availability of data is driving customers to rely on large-scale, sophisticated providers that can efficiently access and create insights from data sourced, aggregated, and integrated from myriad disparate sources such as First Advantage.
 •Advances in Analytics to Increase Value of Data: The increasing accessibility of robust datasets supplemented by machine learning technologies is driving heightened focus on integrating screening insights and dashboards with human resources, compliance, and security workflows. Customers often lack internal resources to develop such analytical and visualization tools, increasing demand for providers like First Advantage that offer these cutting-edge integrated data analytics capabilities.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to continue to grow our business profitably by pursuing the following strategies:
 •Continue to Win New Customers. We are focused on winning new customers across industry verticals, particularly those with attractive, long-term hiring outlooks such as e-commerce, essential retail, and transportation and home delivery, and sectors that are increasingly requiring deeper, more frequent checks with high compliance standards such as healthcare. We are also prioritizing new verticals that align with positive secular macroeconomic trends. We primarily focus on large Enterprise customers, which we believe are well-positioned for durable, long-term growth, have complex and diverse global operations, and, as a result, have the highest demand for our products and solutions. We believe our innovative and differentiated solutions, high-performing Sales and Customer Success teams, operational excellence, and industry-leading reputation and brand will enable us to expand our customer base successfully.
 •Growth within Our Existing Customer Base through Upselling and Cross-selling. Our customers frequently begin their relationship with us by implementing a few core products and subsequently expanding their usage of our solutions platform over time to build a more comprehensive approach to screening and risk management. We drive upsell as customers extend our products and solutions to new divisions and geographies, perform more extensive screens, and purchase additional complementary pre-onboarding products. We also cross-sell additional risk mitigation and compliance solutions such as post-onboarding screening, hiring tax credits, and fleet solutions. Our Sales and Customer Success teams frequently engage with our existing customers and identify areas where we can provide additional value and products. Our deeply entrenched, dedicated Customer Success teams work closely with our customers to develop robust and rigorous compliance and risk management programs within their organizations. We believe that our total revenue opportunity with current customers can substantially increase the size of our current revenue base when taking into account cross-selling and upselling opportunities. Revenues from cross-sell and upsell added approximately 4 percentage points to our revenue growth rate in each of 2022, 2021, and 2020. We will continue to hone our sales and marketing engine to increase product penetration within our existing customer base.
 •Continue to Innovate Our Product Offerings. We plan to continue to expand our data solutions and adjacent product revenues. For example, we are currently investing in criminal and verifications data products and identity services. In addition, we are developing innovative solutions that align with our capabilities in areas such as biometric verification, fraud mitigation, driver and vehicle compliance, franchise screening programs, and remote drug testing. We will continue to invest significantly in our technology to sustain and advance our product leadership.
 •Expand Internationally. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to expand into underpenetrated, high-growth international geographies. As multinational corporations increasingly systematize and elevate their human resources policies and screening providers across the globe, while at the same time dealing with a growing set of local requirements, we believe we are uniquely positioned to address their global risk management and compliance requirements. The substantial majority of Enterprise customers do not currently have a single, global provider but are actively evaluating opportunities to consolidate their screening programs. We will continue to invest in international Sales and Customer Success to win these expansion opportunities and drive broader industry adoption.


•Selectively Pursue Complementary Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships. Our acquisition and partnership strategy centers on delivering additional value to our customers through expanded product capabilities and industry or geographic expertise and scale. Over the last two years, we completed four acquisitions, each of which either strategically expanded First Advantage’s international presence or strengthened specific industry offerings. We intend to augment our organic growth by continuing to take a disciplined approach in identifying and evaluating potential strategic acquisition, investment, and partnership opportunities that strengthen our market positions, enhance our product offerings, strengthen our technology and/or data capabilities, and/or allow us to enter new markets.
 The First Advantage Product Suite
 Our comprehensive product suite enables our customers across all industry sectors to perform pre-onboarding screening and post-onboarding monitoring of employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our products and solutions into three categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products, each of which is enabled by our technology, proprietary internal databases, and data analytics capabilities. Historically, we have derived a substantial majority of our revenues from pre-onboarding products and solutions.
 Pre-Onboarding
 We offer an extensive array of products and solutions that customers utilize to enhance their applicant evaluation process, ensure compliance from the time applicant information is initially requested and submitted to an applicant’s successful onboarding, and enhance workplace safety. Our technology is flexibly tailored to each customer’s requirements, which could include a wide array of search categories such as Social Security number verification, education, and employment verification, federal criminal checks, statewide criminal checks, country criminal checks, sex offender registry, and global sanctions. Our pre-onboarding products include:
 •Criminal background checks: Utilizes our proprietary National Criminal Records File database, which encompasses hundreds of millions of criminal records along with court and other public records to help identify relevant matching and reportable criminal record histories.
 •Drug / Health screening: Offers various drug screening products, including saliva, urine, hair, and blood testing options, physical exams, and instant oral drug screening products performed by mouth swab collection.
 •Extended workforce screening: Enables our customers to efficiently screen large numbers of contingent, contract, and temporary workers across various search types.
 •FBI channeling: As an approved Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) channeler, handles submissions of fingerprints to the FBI National Criminal Records database and returns Criminal Record Information from the FBI to authorized recipients, including through a secure connection to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).
 •Identity checks and biometric fraud mitigation tools: Includes government ID validation, mobile facial recognition, and identity and fraud mitigation tools.
 •Education / Work history verification: Validates work history and education of applicants, leveraging our proprietary Verified! database, internal fulfillment, or through partnerships with other data providers.
 •Driver records and compliance: Collection and storage of driver qualification files, as well as drug screening and background checks to assist with compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), International Fuel Tax Agreement (“IFTA”), and other regulatory agencies across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
 •Healthcare credentials: Through our extensive Healthcare Exclusions Actions and Licensures (“HEAL”) product, verifies and documents the educational background, training, experience, and other credentials of healthcare employees, contractors, volunteers, and vendors, including identifying exclusions and sanctions by medical boards, Medicaid and Medicare, the Office of Inspector General, and the General Services Administration.
 •I-9 verification: Enables our customers to simplify and manage the process of onboarding new hires, by streamlining employment eligibility verification through the convenience of digital workflows. 
 •Executive screening: Provides in-depth investigative reports to confirm various aspects of credentials not typically covered by most background checks, such as civil litigation and bankruptcies, negative media searches, controversies and inconsistencies in business dealings, corporate and regulatory history, and potential conflicts of interest.
 •Others: Includes screening products such as global sanctions, professional licenses and credentials verification, and social media checks.


Post-Onboarding
 Companies face a heightened responsibility to ensure safety and comply with laws, regulations, and licensing requirements after the initial screening and onboarding of an applicant. We provide our customers with continuous monitoring and re-screening solutions that are important tools to keep their end customers, workforces, and other stakeholders safe, productive, and compliant. Continuous monitoring solutions allow customers to be proactively alerted as soon as relevant information, which may require immediate attention and action, becomes available. Our post-onboarding solutions include:
 •Criminal records monitoring: Enables our customers to receive ongoing notification of any reportable criminal records of their employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers.
 •Healthcare sanctions: Our HEAL product provides ongoing healthcare-related compliance monitoring, which allows our customers to ensure doctors, nurses, other employees, and vendors have valid licenses and no exclusions, sanctions, or board actions against them.
 •Motor vehicle records: Provides customers with a streamlined process to establish an initial driver file and enroll drivers into the continuous monitoring program, which reports new violations and driver records changes.
 •Social media: Offers continuous social media screening tailored to a customers’ specific criteria.
 •Global sanctions and licenses: Continuously monitors more than 1,000 source lists and searches a broad range of individual watchlists and key sanctions sources.
 Adjacent Products
 We also offer adjacent products that complement our pre-onboarding and post-onboarding products and solutions:
 •Fleet / Vehicle compliance: Comprehensive solutions for fleet managers to support compliance with various state and federal requirements, including licenses, titles, registrations, and gas taxes.
 •Hiring tax credits and incentives: Identifies and processes U.S. employment tax credits and economic incentive programs, including the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (“WOTC”) program and other federal, state, and local incentives. Uses data collected from applicants during their background screen to increase quality and efficiency.
 •Resident / Tenant screening: Enables property managers, landlords, owners, and leasing agents to screen prospective tenants.
 •Investigative research: Provides in-depth investigative reports, similar to our Executive Screening products, used in performing due diligence of alternative investment managers and senior executives before a major investment commitment or M&A transaction.
 Our suite of products is available individually or through packaged solutions configured and tailored according to our customers’ needs. For example, through our RoadReady solution, we provide comprehensive driver and fleet solutions in compliance and asset management. Our driver compliance products include pre-onboarding background checks, MVRs, drug tests, driver files, and post-onboarding monitoring. Our asset management products related to vehicle compliance include title management, registration, fuel and gas tax, permits, transponder management, and ongoing data analytics. All these products that comprise our RoadReady solution can be purchased individually or as a package.
 Analytics Through Insight Advantage
 In addition to the products described above, we provide customers with actionable, data-driven analytics and insights that help inform decisions related to human capital more generally, as well as optimize their screening programs. We deliver these insights and analytics through Insight Advantage. This powerful and dynamic tool enables customers to analyze their performance and benchmark it against industry data, such as hiring volumes by geography, as well as evaluate their screening program against industry best practices. Our customers can also identify the scope of the pool of qualified applicants in a specified geography, which informs their decision as to whether to expand operations in such geography. In addition, our customers can dynamically adjust the stringency of their screening criteria to view and assess the expected impact on hire rates, turnaround times, and screening costs. Insight Advantage’s dashboard reports and real-time queries help customers quickly identify opportunities to remedy problems before they impact their screening and onboarding process. We believe our ability to provide these data-driven insights, enabled by our sophisticated and differentiated technology, sets us apart from our competitors.
Our Differentiated Technology
Background screening involves complex workflows, disparate internal and external data sources, and numerous integrations with third-party software providers. We believe our differentiated technology provides us with a strong competitive advantage. Our front-end technology, including our powerful UI/UX design, creates a superior applicant and Enterprise customer experience, leveraging AI and machine learning to optimize workflows and minimize applicant data capture errors and missing information. Our back-end technology and processing engine seamlessly integrate interactions with customer HCM platforms and other software, government, and third-party data sources, as well as internal Operations and Customer Care teams. We have been, and will continue to be, pioneers in using automation and intelligent routing technologies to optimize turnaround times, quality, and touchless end-to-end screening. Our compliance rules engine governs all aspects of our technology and is designed to meet ever-changing global regulatory and compliance requirements.
 Our customers and their applicants access our technology through intuitive, easy-to-use user interfaces – Profile Advantage, Enterprise Advantage, and Insight Advantage.
 •Profile Advantage: Our applicant-facing technology available in 19 languages, offers intuitive design with chatbots, digital camera-enabled document uploads, and ID verification for a streamlined applicant experience. Profile Advantage provides a modern, easy-to-use experience, which is critical. It is often the first and one of the most important early interactions between an applicant and our customers. Profile Advantage can be accessed through a computer, tablet, or mobile device and is built for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (“WCAG”) 2.1 to be easily accessed by people with disabilities. We believe that applicants view this experience as an important reflection of the customer. As such, customers can extend their branding to Profile Advantage to help improve applicant engagement. With its embedded AI, machine learning, and powerful features such as auto-fill, Profile Advantage drives significant time savings for both applicants and customers and enables fast time-to-hire.
 •Enterprise Advantage: Our core, global end-to-end customer ordering and processing technology, Enterprise Advantage, enables our customers to order any of our products and solutions at scale. It has an average of 99.9% uptime due to its seamless integrations with our customers’ business processes and workflows, third-party enterprise software systems such as HCM and ATS platforms, and third-party data sources. Through Enterprise Advantage, our customers can easily manage their screening programs, either through centralized processes or by region or division, create customized screening packages, manage screening criteria, and administer adverse action letters.
 •Insight Advantage: Our innovative, dynamic analytics tool offers our customers dashboards and automated reporting to assess their screening programs’ underlying drivers and make data-driven decisions. We leverage the customer’s unique applicant and screening data collected through Profile Advantage and Enterprise Advantage to create insights presented in dynamic dashboards. Customers have the ability to customize their dashboards and perform scenario analysis with our intuitive and flexible tools. Customers can also overlay key metrics from industry peer groups to discover and benchmark best-practices so that they may optimize their screening programs to deliver best-in-class performance. 
 We have designed our technology architecture for extensibility. We receive data directly from the applicant through Profile Advantage and from our customers through their third-party HCM and ATS software platforms. This data is supplemented by our proprietary internal databases and external data sources as we perform verifications. Our proprietary internal databases of over 690 million records include our National Criminal Records File, offering access to approximately 625 million criminal records with thousands of new records added daily, and Verified!, our repository of more than 65 million prior education and work history records. These proprietary internal databases allow us to complete our verifications process quickly and cost-effectively, which accelerates the onboarding process for our customers and improves the applicant experience. We also obtain data directly from federal, state, and local government entities, laboratories and collection sites, credit bureaus, and education and work history verification providers, as well as from third-party, independent compilers of public records. Our API integrations, either through our XChange Standard API or our XChange REST API, allow for real-time, bidirectional, and secure data flows between us and our customers’ software platforms and external data sources, creating a seamless and integrated screening process. Our technology interfaces with more than 75 third-party HCM software platforms and more than 935 automated and/or integrated external data providers. In addition to our APIs, we leverage our RPA tools and AI software to deliver results to our customers with high speed and accuracy.
 Background screening and verification requirements vary from customer to customer, depending on the size and geographic footprint of the business as well as the industry vertical in which the customer operates. For example, customers in the transportation, logistics, and home delivery industry may have screening requirements relating to transportation regulatory bodies, including the DOT, FMCSA, FAA, and IFTA, that customers in other industries do not require. In addition, the laws and regulations on the use of certain information vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. We have designed our technology to be highly configurable, allowing us to provide our customers with tailored solutions that meet their specific needs. Our powerful compliance rules engine is continually updated to reflect the changing legal and regulatory landscape, ensuring that the use by our customers of data and information we provide them with is compliant with complex and changing data usage guidelines and regulatory requirements.


Our flexible, scalable, and highly integrated technology, powered by a differentiated compliance rules engine and enhanced by our investments in automation and AI, has driven significant operational efficiencies and enabled us to achieve one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings among our competitors for quality, accuracy, and turnaround times. We will continue to innovate using agile software development methodologies, focusing on user-centered design, to bring leading products and solutions to the market.
 Sales and Marketing
 We believe we have a highly differentiated, verticalized sales, customer success, and marketing approach that sets us apart from our competitors and positions us to capture additional market share. Our Sales team is vertically aligned and organized into groups that target new accounts and additional opportunities within existing accounts. We train and educate our sales professionals to ensure they are highly knowledgeable in the industry-specific screening requirements and can deliver value-added, industry-targeted solutions to existing and new customers.
 Our Sales team is augmented by Customer Success professionals, who are similarly organized to deliver solutions specific to existing customers within each industry vertical. Our Customer Success team members are located across geographies to foster deep relationships with customers and build local expertise in compliance and screening standards. Our Customer Success teams maintain ongoing interactions with key customer users and program owners and hold regular formal customer account reviews to ensure high performance, satisfaction, and retention. They also organize our customer advisory boards and events to uncover product insights, drive product innovation, and share screening and compliance best practices with our customers. This further drives our industry-leading NPS and high customer retention rates and helps us identify and execute additional opportunities with existing customers.
 We believe the extensive coordination between our Sales, Customer Success, and Product teams is a driving force behind our continued expansion. These teams also enhance our value proposition by working closely with our Compliance, Marketing, Solutions Engineering, and Business Development teams.
 Our relationships with HCM software providers are an important aspect of our Sales and Marketing strategy. Our technology is tightly integrated with major HCM and ATS platforms, which offers greater speed and efficiency and enhances the value of our solutions to our customers. Maintaining a strong relationship with these third-party software providers is critical in generating new sales leads and providing market validation to our offerings.
 We also market our products and solutions through indirect channels, including traditional and online marketing activities designed to provide sales leads, increase market awareness, and enhance the perception of our brand and offerings. We leverage referral partners, channel partnerships, digital advertising, search engine optimization, webinars, social media, thought leadership, and various event-based marketing. We participate in industry conferences and are published frequently in the industry press. Additionally, our annual customer conference, Collaborate, has historically been attended by over 300 participants, and has featured presentations by our customers on a wide range of industry topics. Collaborate facilitates discussions and serves as a great resource on industry best practices. We believe we are able to capitalize on the network effects as we build goodwill through customer reviews and testimonials, word-of-mouth referrals, and references from other industry participants.
 Customers
 We serve a diversified customer base with approximately 33,000 customers globally in 2022, including six of the top ten largest private employers in the United States, over 50% of the Fortune 100, and approximately one-third of the Fortune 500. Our customer base ranges from small businesses with fewer than 100 employees to multinational corporations with workforces numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We have executed a concerted go-to-market strategy to target customers with large, complex workforces and have built a leading customer portfolio in this area as a result. While our customers operate in diverse industries across almost all facets of the global economy, we have strength in sectors with favorable secular trends such as e-commerce, retail, transportation, warehousing, healthcare, and staffing. We have maintained a gross retention rate of approximately 97% in 2022 and achieved an average tenure of 13 years amongst our top 100 customers.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had one customer that accounted for approximately 10% of our revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for such period. As of December 31, 2022, we performed screens in over 200 countries and territories, with a major presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Approximately 85% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were derived from our Americas business.
Competition
 The global background screening and verifications industry is fragmented and competitive. There are many local, single-country companies but few multinational companies that operate with scale and reach. Our competitors vary based on customer size, industry vertical, geography, and product focus.
 We compete with large players with broad capabilities and product suites, vertical-focused specialist firms that target customers operating in select industries, mid-size players and competitors that serve small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) customers. Some competitors are aligned to a specific product in certain pre-onboarding product lines, such as drug / health screening and executive screening. In our adjacent products market, we compete with certain companies specializing in fleet / vehicle compliance, hiring tax credits and incentives, resident / tenant screening, employment eligibility, and investigative research.
 The market for our products and solutions is subject to constant change, sources of competition are numerous, and new competitors frequently arise.
 The principal competitive factors affecting our markets include:
 •accuracy of screening results;
 •turnaround time of screening results;
 •product, package, and solution pricing;
 •applicant and enterprise user experience, ease of use, level of functionality, scalability, and efficiency;
 •breadth and depth of screening solutions;
 •geographical reach;
 •sales and marketing relationship history with the key decision-makers;
 •compliance and regulation;
 •industry vertical support that meets the needs of a customers’ specific requirements;
 •technical and systems performance, including the ability to integrate with customer and third-party systems and applications; and
 •cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection.
 We believe we compete favorably based on these factors. However, our ability to remain competitive will depend on our continued ability to perform in the areas listed above. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We operate in a penetrated and competitive market.”


Government Regulations
 Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to significant and extensive U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include national, international, state, and local cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, health, taxation, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering, antitrust / competition, enterprise credit reporting agencies and environmental, health and safety protection. Taking commercially reasonable steps to comply with such laws and regulations is an important priority for us.
 Regulators worldwide have adopted or proposed national, international, state, and local laws that regulate consumer protection, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, and/or business credit reporting. These laws impact, among other things, the collection, use, disclosure, sale, transfer, receipt, storage, transmission, destruction, and other processing of personal data (collectively, “Processing”). The principal laws and regulations that impact our business include, but are not limited to:
 •FCRA, which regulates the use of consumer report information and governs the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of such information;
 •Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices with respect to consumer financial services practices;
 •Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions;
 •Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare-related businesses;
 •Drivers’ Privacy Protection Act, which restricts the public disclosure, use, and resale of personal data contained in state department of motor vehicle records;
 •U.K. Digital Identity & Attributes Trust Framework, which provides for a set of rules and standards for digital identity products;
 •U.K. and EU GDPR;
 •Various U.S. federal, state, and local data protection and consumer reporting agency laws at the state level, state data breach laws, and state privacy laws, such as the CCPA and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act;
 •International data protection, data localization, and state secret laws impacting our data suppliers, such as the EU GDPR, or us; and
 •Oversight by regulatory authorities for engaging in consumer reporting, including the FTC and CFPB in the United States.
 These laws and regulations, which are generally designed to protect individuals’ privacy and prevent the misuse of personal data or unauthorized access to data, are complex, subject to ongoing changes in regulations and amendments, and inconsistent between jurisdictions. We proactively manage our compliance with laws and regulations through the use of a number of resources, including our in-house legal and compliance department, which consists of more than 35 legal and compliance professionals, external law firms, trade associations, and local suppliers and partners to understand the legal and regulatory requirements and practices that may impact the delivery of our products and solutions as well as our customers’ use of the same in light of employment, privacy and other laws and regulations. Our General Counsel leads our legal department with a Chief Global Compliance Officer reporting to the General Counsel. The compliance team consists of four regional compliance officers globally, with local compliance officers reporting through that hierarchy. Through the legal and compliance functions, we train our team members with respect to compliance with our policies and procedures, monitor changes to relevant material laws and regulations, and meet with regulators and legislators, as necessary and appropriate, to establish transparency of our operations and build trust.
 Public concern is high with respect to the processing of personal data, including Social Security numbers, financial information, and medical information. In the future, additional legislative or regulatory efforts in the United States and internationally could further regulate the processing of personal data that we process in the conduct of our business. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If regulatory regimes continue to heighten their scrutiny over personal data and data security, it could lead to increased restrictions, loss of revenue opportunity, greater costs of compliance, and lost efficiency” and “— Any damage to our reputation or our brand could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”


Intellectual Property
 Our success depends, in part, on developing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. We own and control various intellectual property rights, such as confidential information, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, copyrights, patents, and U.S. and foreign registrations and applications in the foregoing. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and certain third parties are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
 Obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights is an important aspect of our business. We rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent), contract, and liability safeguards (e.g., confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with our vendors) to protect our intellectual property in the United States, and other jurisdictions. We currently have patent and trademark applications pending in several jurisdictions. Filing these applications does not guarantee patents will be issued or that our trademark applications will proceed to registration without challenge, but may provide us with legal defense and allow us to pursue the protection of our intellectual property to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
 While we believe that our intellectual property, in the aggregate, is generally important to our business and operations, we do not regard any aspect of our business as being dependent upon any single patent, group of patents or other intellectual property right. However, the First Advantage name and related trade names, marks, and logos are of material importance to our business, and their loss could have a significant negative impact on us.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
 Seasonality
 We experience seasonality with respect to certain industries due to fluctuations in hiring volumes and other economic activity. For example, pre-onboarding revenues generated from our customers in the retail and transportation industries are historically highest during the months of October and November, leading up to the holiday season and lowest at the beginning of the new year, following the holiday season. Certain customers across various industries also historically ramp up their hiring throughout the second quarter of the year as winter concludes, commercial activity tied to outdoor activities increases, and the school year ends, giving rise to student and graduate hiring. In addition, apartment rental activity and associated screening activity typically decline in the fourth quarter heading into the holiday season. We expect that further growth in e-commerce, the continued digital transformation of the economy, and other economic forces may impact future seasonality, but we are unable to predict these potential shifts and how our business may be impacted.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5,800 employees in 19 countries. Our workforce also engages third-party contractors as an ongoing part of our business where appropriate. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and no work stoppages have been experienced. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 In our continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented operational changes with the primary objective of safety for our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and to comply with government regulations. We have adopted a distributed workforce model, including a long-term, full-time work from home arrangement for some employees, while implementing additional safety measures for employees and contractors continuing essential and critical on-site work.
 Global Code of Conduct and Ethics
 The quality of our products and operations affects our reputation, productivity, profitability, and market position. Our objective is to create a work environment that allows and encourages all employees to perform their duties in an efficient, effective manner. We have established a Global Code of Conduct and Ethics (“Code”). Compliance with the provisions of the Code is a basic condition of employment at First Advantage.
Equal Employment
 We strive for all of our employees to work in an environment where we are treated with dignity and respect. We are an equal opportunity employment employer and are committed to providing a workplace that is free of discrimination of all types from abusive, offensive, or harassing behavior. We are committed to creating such an environment because it brings out the full potential in each of our employees, which, in turn, contributes directly to our business success.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to enhancing diversity among our workforce and demonstrating that commitment to our employees, customers, and community. We promote diversity by developing policies, programs, and procedures that foster a work environment where differences are respected and all employees are treated fairly.
 Diversity refers to human differences that exist in the workplace, including those based on culture, ethnicity, gender, and age. We believe that promoting diversity plays an important role in attracting the most expansive pool of qualified applicants, fostering greater innovation and creativity, and enhancing our communication and relationships with all of our stakeholders.
 Our goal is to attract, develop, and retain the best and brightest from all walks of life and backgrounds. This requires an organization to have a culture of inclusion where all individuals feel respected, are treated fairly, and are provided work-life balance and an opportunity to excel in their chosen careers. We leverage our diverse and inclusive workforce to achieve superior business results.
 Supplier Diversity
 We are committed to developing mutually beneficial relationships with small, minority-owned, women-owned, disadvantaged, veteran-owned, HUBZONE, LGBT, and local business enterprises. Our supplier diversity policy reflects our desire to create an opportunity for suppliers to market their products to the Company. When all business considerations are determined to be equal among competitive suppliers, the Company will award contracts to such businesses.
