Item 1. Business
We are a national leader in providing patient-centered, healthcare-at-home solutions including home medical equipment (“HME”), medical supplies, and related services. We focus primarily on providing (i) sleep therapy equipment, supplies and related services (including CPAP and bi PAP services) to individuals suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”), (ii) medical devices and supplies to patients for the treatment of diabetes (including continuous glucose monitors (“CGM”) and insulin pumps), (iii) home medical equipment to patients discharged from acute care and other facilities, (iv) oxygen and related chronic therapy services in the home, and (v) other HME devices and supplies on behalf of chronically ill patients with wound care, urological, incontinence, ostomy and nutritional supply needs. We service beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance payors. As of December 31, 2022, we serviced approximately 3.9 million patients annually in all 50 states through our network of approximately 725 locations in 47 states. Our principal executive offices are located at 220 West Germantown Pike, Suite 250, Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania 19462.
Company Operations
Product Offering. AdaptHealth delivers patient-centered, healthcare-at-home solutions including home medical equipment, medical supplies, and related services directly to a patient’s home upon discharge from a hospital and/or receipt of a physician/medical referral. The breadth of AdaptHealth’s products is particularly valuable to acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories and long-term care facilities that discharge patients with complex conditions and multiple product needs.
AdaptHealth is often paid a fixed monthly amount for certain HME products as designated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) or commercial insurance payors, such as CPAP equipment, wheelchairs, hospital beds, oxygen concentrators, insulin pumps and other similar products. These sales accounted for approximately 32% of AdaptHealth’s net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
For resupply sale and one-time sale products, which include those deemed to be consumables, AdaptHealth receives a single payment upon sale of the product. These products, which include CPAP masks and related supplies, diabetes management supplies, CGMs, wound care supplies, wheelchair cushions accessories, orthopedic bracing, breast pumps and supplies, walkers, commodes and canes, nutritional supplies and incontinence supplies, accounted for approximately 68% of AdaptHealth’s net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Supply Chain. AdaptHealth plays an important role in delivering HME products to patients in their homes. Manufacturers of home medical equipment and diabetes medical devices sell and ship their products to AdaptHealth directly. AdaptHealth also contracts with national healthcare distribution companies to ship certain HME products directly to patients’ homes. These distributors invoice AdaptHealth for the cost of shipped products at the time of sale. AdaptHealth receives referrals from a variety of sources, such as acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist and endocrinologist offices, skilled nursing facilities, hospice operators, and primary care providers, among others. AdaptHealth’s products are either shipped to patients’ homes by AdaptHealth-operated or contracted delivery trucks or shipped using proprietary or third-party distribution services. AdaptHealth invoices payors and patients directly for the products that are delivered and for the services that are provided.
Operating Structure
Management. AdaptHealth is led by a proven management team with experience in the HME industry across a variety of healthcare organizations. AdaptHealth has a centralized approach for key business processes, including revenue cycle management, strategic purchases, payor contracting, mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity, finance, compliance, legal, human resources, IT and sales management. In addition, AdaptHealth has centralized many of the functions relating to its CPAP and other resupply businesses. However, AdaptHealth believes that the personalized nature of customer requirements and referral relationships, characteristic of the home healthcare business, mandate that it emphasize a localized operating structure as well. AdaptHealth focuses on regional management to respond promptly and effectively to local market demands and opportunities. AdaptHealth’s regional managers are responsible and accountable for maintaining and developing relationships with referral sources, customer service for non-CPAP supply product lines and logistics for non-drop-shipped products.

IT. AdaptHealth has established an integrated, technology-enabled, centralized platform, distinguishing itself from many of its competitors who traditionally use less automated processes that are typically complex, can be prone to mistakes and are less efficient. AdaptHealth’s technology enables automated, compliant, and integrated workflow into patients’ delivery of care. AdaptHealth believes that this advanced technology platform provides it with a competitive advantage through its unique components that cater to patients and physicians. AdaptHealth believes that its technology platform has several characteristics that appeal to physicians, including its ease of use, the improved compliance it enables through its integrated systems and the automated, integrated workflow it provides for patients’ delivery of care. Additionally, AdaptHealth’s e-prescribing capabilities enhance transparency and reduce transcription and other errors. AdaptHealth believes that patients are also better served due to the efficiency from time of order to delivery and the seamless integration across points of care enabled by AdaptHealth’s platform. The integrated system also provides AdaptHealth management with critical information in a timely manner, allowing them to track performance levels company wide. On February 1, 2021, AdaptHealth acquired AeroCare Holdings, Inc. (“AeroCare”). Subsequent to the acquisition of AeroCare, AdaptHealth replaced its mobile delivery software technology provided by a third party with AeroCare’s proprietary mobile delivery technology called OTL. This technology has allowed AdaptHealth to add many features to its existing technology, such as delivery notification, patient satisfaction applications and referral source notifications. This application, combined with AdaptHealth’s data warehouse and evolving data lake, has allowed AdaptHealth to build out a 360-degree view of its patients and activities, and to ultimately act as a fundamental component of the operating system of AdaptHealth.
AdaptHealth has formed close relationships with its third-party software providers, including Brightree, Snapworx, LLC and Parachute Health, to optimize its HME workflow. An example of this optimization is AdaptHealth’s automated point-of-delivery technology, which tracks AdaptHealth’s drivers and produces paperless, secure delivery tickets which are uploaded directly to the patient’s file and available immediately on an enterprise-wide basis. In addition, to address ongoing and growing threats related to cyberattacks, AdaptHealth continues to deploy market leading defense tools to protect and secure its networks and data.
Revenue Cycle Management. AdaptHealth’s revenue cycle management and billing processes have both manual and computerized elements that are designed to maintain the integrity of revenue and accounts receivable. Third-party payors that can accommodate electronic claims submission, such as Medicare, certain state Medicaid payors and many commercial insurance payors, are billed electronically on a daily basis. For other payors, who are unable to accept electronic submissions, AdaptHealth generates paper claims and invoices.
Outsourced Providers
AdaptHealth contracts with business process outsourcing providers to provide certain billing, accounts payable and administrative functions. These providers are based in India and the Philippines and provide AdaptHealth with the ability to scale its workforce in a cost-effective manner. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 4,200 full-time equivalent personnel were provided to AdaptHealth under such arrangements. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales activities are generally carried out by AdaptHealth’s full-time sales representatives with assistance from on-site liaisons in certain markets who interact directly with hospital discharge coordinators and patients. AdaptHealth’s sales team works closely with AdaptHealth’s trained respiratory therapists in carrying out their daily sales activities. AdaptHealth primarily acquires new patients through referrals. Sources of referrals include acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist and endocrinologist offices, skilled nursing facilities, hospice operators, and primary care providers, among others. AdaptHealth’s sales representatives maintain continual contact with medical professionals across these facilities. AdaptHealth believes that its relationships with its referral sources are strong and that these entities will continue to be a source of non-acquired growth through new patients. While AdaptHealth views its referral sources as fundamental to its business, no single referral source accounted for a material amount of its annual net revenue as of December 31, 2022.
Acquisitions
Continuing to grow through accretive acquisitions is a key element of AdaptHealth’s growth strategy, and AdaptHealth continuously reviews its pipeline of potential acquisition candidates. AdaptHealth maintains an M&A integration team and leverages its scalable front-end and back-office technology platform to facilitate acquisition integration to help realize short-term cost saving synergies and longer-term revenue growth synergies.
Table of Contents

During the year ended December 31, 2022, AdaptHealth completed acquisitions involving eight companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $17.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, AdaptHealth completed acquisitions involving 23 companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $2.9 billion (excluding amounts related to contingent consideration), primarily from the acquisition of AeroCare, which had aggregate consideration of approximately $2.4 billion.
Suppliers
AdaptHealth purchases home healthcare equipment, medical devices and supplies from a variety of suppliers. AdaptHealth’s sleep therapy equipment and supplies are primarily provided by three suppliers, its mobility and home services products (such as hospital beds, wheelchairs, walkers and commodes) are principally supplied by two suppliers and its diabetes services products/CGM products are primarily provided by two suppliers. As discussed in more detail in Item 1A, Risk Factors, on June 14, 2021, AdaptHealth received notice from Philips Respironics (“Philips”) that certain ventilator, BiPAP, and CPAP devices would be included in a Philips voluntary recall due to potential health risks to patients. It was not possible to purchase these products from Philips, which led to shortages in the supply chain, and other suppliers were unable to meet the strong patient demand for these products, which materially affected AdaptHealth’s ability to service patient demand for these devices during the year ended December 31, 2021. During 2022, there was improved ability to purchase these products from alternative suppliers but continued shortages in the supply chain materially impacted AdaptHealth's ability to service patient demand for these devices. This recall may cause AdaptHealth to incur significant costs, some or all of which may not be recoverable from the product manufacturer. The recall has, and may continue to, materially negatively affect AdaptHealth’s business and results of operations as a result of patients not using their impacted devices, current shortages in the availability of both replacement devices for impacted patients and new devices for new patients, patient hesitancy to use respiratory devices generally or other reasons. It is unclear how long the potential shortages could last, but if the inability to purchase these products continues for an extended period of time, the impact could continue to materially adversely affect AdaptHealth’s business and results of operations.
Facilities
AdaptHealth does not own any properties and leases its operating locations. As of December 31, 2022, AdaptHealth serviced approximately 3.9 million patients annually across all 50 states, and, during the year ended December 31, 2022, performed an average of approximately 36,000 equipment and supply deliveries a day through its network of approximately 725 locations in 47 states. Full-service locations are typically up to approximately 5,000 square feet and are usually a combination of office and warehouse space. Many of these facilities are accredited to provide patients with medical products, equipment and related services, and their adjacent warehouse space is used for storage of adequate supplies of equipment and accessories for such patient services. AdaptHealth believes that these facilities are adequate to meet its current needs and expects to add additional facilities in connection with its growth strategies. AdaptHealth believes that such additional space, when required, will be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, AdaptHealth had approximately 10,900 employees. AdaptHealth’s human capital resources objectives and compensation program include attracting and retaining highly motivated, well-qualified employees and executives. AdaptHealth uses a mix of competitive salaries and other benefits to attract and retain employees and executives. AdaptHealth believes that relations between its management and employees are good, and it is committed to inclusion and policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment. The health and safety of AdaptHealth’s employees, patients and customers are of primary concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AdaptHealth took significant steps to protect its workforce including, but not limited to, working remotely, introducing contact-free operational procedures, procuring personal protective equipment, communicating hygiene and cleaning protocols, and implementing mandatory face-covering usage, self-monitoring processes, and social distancing protocols consistent with guidelines issued by federal, state and local law. While the health and safety of AdaptHealth’s employees, patients and customers remain its primary concern, AdaptHealth has implemented policies around returning to offices and relaxed mask requirements.
Diversity and Inclusion
AdaptHealth’s values of belonging, inclusion and diversity for success enable it to unlock the strengths of its employees to transform healthcare and improve lives. Strategic key initiatives include the formation of AdaptHealth’s Diversity and Inclusion Council, learning and development opportunities around the concepts of leading inclusively, 
Table of Contents

inclusion in the workforce and unconscious bias. AdaptHealth places a high value on inclusion-building initiatives that create opportunities around cultural awareness and social learnings; this is largely accomplished through engaging employees in its Diversity and Inclusion Council, which is supported by employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences who share a common interest in professional development and improving corporate culture. 
Talent Development and Retention
Building and strengthening AdaptHealth’s talent pipeline is imperative to its success. AdaptHealth's management team has implemented various talent development initiatives. For example, AdaptHealth’s approach to talent and performance is designed to ensure employees and managers have regular feedback conversations about performance goals and development, to enable its high-performance culture, and to create an environment where it achieves its strategy. AdaptHealth has career and development pathways designed for specific roles in consultation with operational management and human resources.
Competition
The HME market is fragmented and highly competitive. AdaptHealth competes with other large national providers, including Owens & Minor Inc., Lincare Holdings Inc., Rotech Healthcare, Inc. and Cardinal Health, Inc.; regional providers, including DASCO Home Medical Equipment, Binson’s Medical Equipment, Inc., Norco, Inc., Protech Home Medical Corp. and Quipt Home Medical; and product-specific providers, including Breg, Inc., Inogen, Inc., Acelity L.P., CCS Medical, and Advanced Diabetes Supply, as well as over 6,000 generally smaller local providers. In addition, AdaptHealth competes with non-HME providers, including CVS and Amazon.
Consolidation of the HME market is a continuing trend, as required technology investments and reduced reimbursements put financial pressure on smaller providers. Larger HME providers with integrated technology and automated processes are generally better positioned to gain market share and more attractive vendor pricing. The Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, & Supplies (“DMEPOS”) Competitive Bidding Program also emphasizes the importance of relationships with both the payors and referral sources. Because payors typically select a limited number of exclusive suppliers, and physicians typically refer based on timely delivery and consistency, relationships with both are critical to success in the market.
AdaptHealth believes that the most important competitive factors in the regional and local markets are:
•Quality of patient care, including clinical expertise;
•Service quality and an efficient, responsive referral process;
•Differentiated technology platform that provides a superior physician and patient experience;
•Reputation with referral sources, including local physicians and hospital-based professionals;
•Comprehensive offering across the home medical equipment space;
•Broad network of payor contracts and regional insurers; and
•Overall ease of doing business.
AdaptHealth believes that it competes favorably with competitors on the basis of these and other factors.
Legal Proceedings
See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Commitments and Contingencies."
Government Regulation
The federal government and all states in which AdaptHealth currently operates regulate various aspects of AdaptHealth’s business. In particular, AdaptHealth’s operations are subject to federal laws that regulate the reimbursement 
Table of Contents

of its products and services under various government programs and that are designed to prevent fraud and abuse. AdaptHealth’s operations are also subject to state laws governing, among other things, pharmacies, nursing services, medical equipment suppliers and certain types of home health activities. State regulators may also determine that telephone marketing of AdaptHealth products and services to patients fall within state regulation of telemarketing. Certain of AdaptHealth’s employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the licensure and professional practice of respiratory therapy, pharmacy and nursing.
AdaptHealth maintains a Compliance Program that is designed to meet the guidelines set forth by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), and provides ongoing compliance training designed to keep AdaptHealth’s officers, directors and employees well-educated and up-to-date regarding developments on relevant topics and to emphasize AdaptHealth’s policy of strict compliance. Federal and state laws require that AdaptHealth obtain facility and other regulatory licenses and accreditation and that AdaptHealth enroll as a supplier with federal and state health programs.
As a healthcare provider, AdaptHealth is subject to extensive regulation to prevent fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs. The marketing, billing, documenting and other practices of healthcare companies are all subject to government scrutiny. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, regional health insurance carriers and state agencies often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support AdaptHealth’s claims submitted for payment of services rendered to customers. Similarly, government agencies and their contractors periodically open investigations and obtain information from healthcare providers pursuant to the legal process. Violations of federal and state regulations can result in severe criminal, civil and administrative penalties and sanctions, including disqualification from Medicare and other reimbursement programs, which could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth’s financial condition and results of operations.
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information or personal information. As part of AdaptHealth’s provision of, and billing for, healthcare equipment and services, AdaptHealth is required to collect and maintain patient-identifiable health information. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for protected health information and the CCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, the CCPA may increase AdaptHealth’s compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, the HITECH Act, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which AdaptHealth handles healthcare-related data and communicate with payers, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. If AdaptHealth does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, it could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.
Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require AdaptHealth to publish statements that describe how it handles personal information and choices individuals may have about the way AdaptHealth handles their personal information. If such information that AdaptHealth publishes is considered untrue, it may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Communications with AdaptHealth’s patients are also subject to laws and regulations governing communications, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 ("TCPA"), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing ("CAN-SPAM") Act, additional fax regulations under the Junk Fax Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Medicare regulations.

Healthcare is an area of rapid regulatory change. Changes in the laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may affect permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business, and reimbursement amounts paid by federal, state and other third-party payers. AdaptHealth cannot predict the future of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or possible changes in national healthcare policies. Future legislative and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth’s financial condition and results of operations.
The long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact AdaptHealth's ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of its business at the quantities and levels it requires. AdaptHealth may bear losses incurred as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of its facilities (such as patient service offices and warehouses), loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change. Governments in the U.S. and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose substantial costs on AdaptHealth. At the present time, we cannot predict their potential effect on AdaptHealth's capital expenditures or results of operations.
Compliance with such laws and regulations is costly and may materially affect AdaptHealth's business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AdaptHealth believes it is in material compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to its operations.
Implemented Regulation
As a provider of home oxygen, respiratory and other chronic therapy equipment to the home healthcare market, AdaptHealth participates in Medicare Part B, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Program, which was established by the Social Security Act of 1965. Providers of home oxygen and other respiratory therapy services and equipment have historically been heavily dependent on Medicare reimbursement due to the high proportion of elderly persons suffering from respiratory disease utilizing Medicare benefits. Durable medical equipment, including oxygen equipment, is traditionally reimbursed by Medicare based on fixed fee schedules.
Impact of the ACA and MIPPA. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended ("ACA"), the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (“MIPPA”), the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (“SCHIP Extension Act”), the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA”) and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), contain provisions that directly impacted reimbursement for the primary respiratory and other durable medical equipment (“DME”) products provided by AdaptHealth.
In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a number of laws that are intended to result in significant changes to the healthcare industry. For example, there have been numerous political and legal efforts to expand, repeal, replace or modify the ACA, since the law’s enactment, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the law, as well as court challenges to the constitutionality of the law. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected one such case on June 17, 2021, when the Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the ACA’s requirement to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage or the individual mandate and dismissed the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Federal regulatory agencies continue to modify ACA regulations and guidance related to the ACA, often as a result of presidential directives. The ultimate outcome of efforts to expand the ACA, substantially amend its provisions, or change funding for the ACA is unknown. Though we cannot predict what, if any, reform proposals will be adopted, healthcare reform and legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA or implement alternative reform measures may result in reduced funding for state Medicaid programs, lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals, and could impact providers and other healthcare industry participants and cause AdaptHealth’s revenues to decrease to the extent such legislation reduces Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement rates.

In December 2003, the MMA was signed into law. The MMA established a Recovery Audit Contractors ("RAC") program, which implemented a new method for recovery of Medicare overpayments by utilizing private companies operating on a contingent fee basis to identify and recoup Medicare overpayments, and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for DME suppliers. The RACs are empowered to audit claims submitted by healthcare providers and overpayments identified by the RACs can be recouped from future payments, including in cases where the reimbursement rules are unclear or subject to differing interpretations. This activity, as well as the activity of intermediaries and others involved in government reimbursement, may include changes in long-standing interpretations of reimbursement rules, which could adversely impact AdaptHealth’s future financial condition and results of operations. In October 2008, CMS established Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”) and Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”), who are responsible for ensuring the integrity of all Medicare-related claims. These legislative and regulatory provisions, as currently in effect, have and will continue to adversely impact AdaptHealth’s financial condition and results of operations.
Impact of Competitive Bidding. The MMA legislation directly impacted reimbursement for the primary respiratory and other DME products that AdaptHealth provides. Among other things, the MMA established a competitive acquisition program for DME. The MMA instructed CMS to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas would be established throughout the United States for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of DME, including oxygen equipment. For each competitive acquisition area, CMS is required to conduct a competition under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered items of DME. Successful bidders are expected to meet certain program quality standards, volume commitments and surety bond requirements in order to be awarded a contract, and only successful bidders can supply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the respective acquisition area (there are, however, regulations in place that allow non-contracted suppliers to continue to provide equipment and services to their existing customers at the new prices determined through the bidding process). Competitive bidding contracts are expected to be re-bid at least every three years. CMS is required to award contracts to multiple entities submitting bids in each area for an item or service but has the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive acquisition area to the number it determines to be necessary to meet projected demand. 
In March 2019, CMS announced that it would consolidate all rounds and areas of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program (“CBP”) into a single round of competition effective January 1, 2021 named “Round 2021.”  Round 2021 contracts became effective on January 1, 2021 and extend through December 31, 2023. CMS included 16 product categories in Round 2021. On April 10, 2020, CMS announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it removed the non-invasive ventilators product category from the Round 2021 DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. 
On October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it would not award competitive bid contracts in 13 of the 15 remaining product categories due to a failure to achieve expected savings, and that contract awards would only be made for off-the-shelf (“OTS”) knee and back braces. All other product categories were removed from Round 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, net revenue generated with respect to providing OTS knee and back braces (excluding amounts generated in non-rural and rural non-bid areas) were not material. AdaptHealth has obtained contracts for OTS knee and back braces, and does not expect the single payment amounts imposed by CMS under such contracts to have a material impact on AdaptHealth.
The competitive bidding process has historically put pressure on the amount AdaptHealth is reimbursed in the markets in which it exists, as well as in areas that are not subject to the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. The rates required to win future competitive bids could continue to depress reimbursement rates. AdaptHealth will continue to monitor developments regarding the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. While AdaptHealth cannot predict the outcome of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program on its business in the future nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, the program may materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.
CMS’s decision to cancel the 2021 competitive bidding program was a significant development for AdaptHealth. On December 28, 2021, CMS permanently finalized the higher blended rates in rural and noncontiguous non-competitive bidding areas. Congress further extended a blended higher Medicare reimbursement rate in non-competitive bidding/non-rural areas through the end of the public health emergency or December 31, 2023, whichever is later, when it reverts to 100% of the Medicare fee schedule. In total, AdaptHealth believes these changes to the competitive bidding program are significantly positive to the business. 
Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor. In order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary and appropriate items and services, the Medicare program has adopted a number of documentation requirements. For example, certain provisions under CMS guidance manuals, local coverage determinations, and the DME Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MAC”) Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the “patient’s medical record” is required to justify the initial and ongoing medical necessity for the 
Table of Contents

provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and other government contractors have recently taken the position, among other things, that the “patient’s medical record” refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but instead to documentation maintained by the patient’s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information created by the DME supplier’s personnel and confirmed by the patient’s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. If treating physicians do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, the risks that AdaptHealth will be subject to audits and payment denials are likely to increase. Moreover, auditors’ interpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation, leading to significant increases in individual supplier and industry-wide perceived error rates. High error rates could lead to further audit activity and regulatory burdens and could result in AdaptHealth making significant refunds and other payments to Medicare and other government programs. Accordingly, AdaptHealth’s future revenues and cash flows from government healthcare programs may be delayed and/or reduced. Private payors also may conduct audits and may take legal action to recover alleged overpayments. AdaptHealth could be adversely affected in some of the markets in which it operates if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to AdaptHealth due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations. AdaptHealth cannot currently predict the adverse impact these measures might have on its financial condition and results of operations, but such impact could be material.
Federal and state budgetary and other cost-containment pressures will continue to impact the home respiratory care industry. AdaptHealth cannot predict whether new federal and state budgetary proposals will be adopted or the effect, if any, such proposals would have on its financial condition and results of operations.
