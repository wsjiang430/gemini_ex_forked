 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Our mission is to help Americans get the healthcare they need at a price they can afford. To achieve this, we are building the leading, consumer-focused digital healthcare platform in the United States.
 GoodRx was founded to solve the challenges that consumers face in understanding, accessing, and affording healthcare. We started with a price comparison tool for prescriptions, offering consumers free access to lower prices on their medication. This price comparison platform processes over 260 billion pricing data points every day and integrates that data into a user-friendly interface which provides consumers with curated, geographically relevant prescription pricing, and access to negotiated prices through GoodRx codes that can be used to save money on prescriptions across the United States.
 Today, we believe our expanded platform improves the health and financial well-being of American families by providing easy access to price transparency and affordability solutions for generic and brand medications both for consumers and healthcare providers, affordable and convenient medical provider consultations and lab tests and other healthcare and wellness related content. We believe that our offerings provide significant savings to consumers, and can help drive greater medication awareness, access and adherence, faster treatment and better patient outcomes that also benefit the broader healthcare ecosystem and its stakeholders.
 We see exciting growth potential as we continue to attract new consumers through our existing offerings, launch new offerings to address more of the needs of healthcare consumers, and improve healthcare affordability and access for all Americans. As we extend our platform, we believe that we can create multiple monetization opportunities at different stages of the consumer healthcare journey, enabling us to drive higher expected consumer lifetime value without significant additional consumer acquisition costs.
 Industry Challenges
 Despite the approximately $4.0 trillion U.S. healthcare market being one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy, it remains opaque and highly fragmented for consumers. Even simple healthcare transactions, such as finding a doctor or filling a prescription at an affordable price, are often difficult. This can lead to confusion, inefficiency and unneeded additional costs for consumers and the healthcare system. The pharmacy is the de-facto “front door” to American healthcare, with frequent consumer interaction and engagement. However, finding affordable prices for prescriptions is complicated by a lack of price transparency, a confusing reimbursement and insurance landscape and a fragmented marketplace in which the list prices for the same medication can vary significantly across pharmacies. We believe that these challenges are driven in part by a lack of solutions that enable consumers to easily search, discover and access the product or service that they need at an affordable price. Consumer-focused technology solutions are essential in healthcare given that the stakes involve peoples’ health and lives.
Our Market Opportunity
 A paradigm shift is occurring in healthcare as consumers are both increasingly informed and cost-conscious. We believe that allowing people to transact using more information than ever before will help Americans consume healthcare more efficiently. This can be accomplished by providing a healthcare platform that allows consumers to search a broad range of choices and offerings, discover what is best for them, transact based on their preferences, and receive the best price while doing so.

We believe this market opportunity is substantial and estimate the total addressable market ("TAM") for our current solutions to be approximately $800.0 billion. This includes a $524.0 billion prescription opportunity, inclusive of prescriptions that are written but not filled, a $30.0 billion pharma manufacturer solutions opportunity and a $250.0 billion telehealth opportunity.
 Prescription Opportunity
 We started our business with a focus on the U.S. prescriptions market. The vast majority of the utilization of our platform relates to generic medications. We also enable consumers to save on brand medications. We believe that the prices available through our platform are highly competitive, for both insured and uninsured consumers, and our platform enables consumers to save on prescription medications regardless of whether the consumer is insured or not. We believe we can drive significant growth in our prescription opportunity through our ability to continue to provide attractive prescription pricing to consumers.
Pharma Manufacturer Solutions Opportunity
 Brand medications tend to be expensive, and insurance coverage is complicated and may be restrictive. Pharma manufacturers provide affordability solutions, such as co-pay cards, patient assistance programs and other savings options, so that consumers can access their medications. We partner with pharma manufacturers to advertise and integrate these affordability solutions into our platform. We believe this offering can deliver incremental margin as we deploy these solutions across our existing base of consumers and visitors, introduce new solutions, and increase the number of brands and manufacturers with which we work.
Telehealth Opportunity
 Our telehealth offering can provide consumers with a convenient and affordable way to receive a diagnosis and a prescription online, when medically appropriate, and we believe our telehealth offering will continue to enhance the accessibility to our prescription and subscription offerings for these consumers; see below for information regarding our subscription offerings. Consumers may opt in to use our prescription transactions offering, our subscription offerings, or our mail delivery service after completing their telehealth visit in order to fill their prescriptions.
Our Value Proposition
 We positively impact many key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. We believe that consumers, healthcare providers, PBMs, pharmacies and pharma manufacturers all win with GoodRx. This, in turn, can drive beneficial and self-reinforcing network effects.
 Our value proposition by stakeholder is described below:
 •Consumers: Our platform provides consumers with a variety of mobile-first offerings designed to make their access to healthcare simple and more affordable. We help people fill prescriptions that they may otherwise not have filled due to cost, and enable them to access treatments through telehealth that they may otherwise have delayed due to long wait times for in-person visits. These solutions increase medication adherence, reduce strain on hospital emergency departments and physicians, and improve health outcomes. 
 oOur prescription transactions offering provides curated, geographically relevant price comparisons and negotiated prices on prescriptions that generate substantial savings to our consumers. Our negotiated prices for prescriptions are often cheaper than insurance co-pays. Access to discounted prices is free for consumers through our platform.
 oOur pharma manufacturer solutions offering provides advertising and integrated consumer affordability solutions to pharma manufacturers with the goal of improving access to and affordability of brand medications for consumers.
 oOur subscription offerings provide consumers and their families with access to even lower prescription prices on select medications in select pharmacies for a monthly or annual subscription fee. Gold also provides mail delivery and discounted access to our GoodRx Care service for no additional subscription cost.
 oOur telehealth offering provides access to online doctor visits and lab test providers.
 oOur platform provides educational resources to help inform consumers about their healthcare. We provide consumers with expert medication information, as well as pricing and coverage information made possible 

through our robust data sources and staff of experienced researchers. We launched GoodRx Health in 2021 to make it easier for consumers to find the healthcare answers they need.
 •Healthcare Professionals: Physicians and other healthcare professionals are motivated to help patients, and, increasingly, are judged by patient outcomes. We help these healthcare professionals improve patient outcomes by encouraging medication adherence and providing a consumer-friendly service. In addition, our enhanced Provider Mode released in 2022, as part of our GoodRx for Providers platform initially launched in 2021, provides healthcare providers with a more customized experience and tools to support patients throughout their healthcare journey. Further, we are able to integrate our pricing information and GoodRx codes directly into Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) systems, enabling healthcare professionals to provide prices from our platform directly to their patients at the point of prescribing, including via EHR-sent text messages and emails. We help physicians engage with patients more efficiently both directly through our telehealth offering and through our prescription transactions offering and subscription offerings. 
 •Healthcare Companies: PBMs, pharmacies and pharma manufacturers use our platform to reach and provide affordability solutions to consumers. We play a valuable role within the healthcare ecosystem by aggregating, normalizing, and presenting information from all of these constituents on a single platform for the consumer. Through the deep relationships that we have developed with these stakeholders over many years, we are able to continually improve our offerings and achieve better pricing outcomes for consumers.
 oPharmacy Benefit Managers: PBMs aggregate consumer demand to negotiate prescription medication prices with pharmacies and manufacturers. PBMs aggregate most of their demand through relationships with insurance companies and employers. However, nearly all PBMs also have consumer direct or cash network pricing that they negotiate with pharmacies for consumers who choose to purchase prescriptions outside of insurance. We provide a platform through which PBMs can drive incremental volume to these networks by offering their discounted prices to our consumers. We expand the market for PBMs by increasing their cash network transaction volumes and by adding new consumers to the overall prescriptions market, many of whom, both insured and uninsured, would otherwise not fill their prescriptions because of high deductibles or prices. For many of our PBM partners, we are their only significant direct-to-consumer channel. To date, no PBM has terminated a relationship with GoodRx, Inc., which highlights the strength of our relationships alongside the value we deliver.
 oPharmacies: With GoodRx, pharmacies can reduce ‘walk away’ patients and prescriptions abandoned at the counter due to high cost, and can also increase overall sales through additional foot-traffic. We work closely with pharmacies to ensure that pharmacists are educated on how to use our apps and websites, and know how to apply GoodRx codes at the point of sale. Consumers can use GoodRx at nearly every retail pharmacy in the United States.
 oPharma Manufacturers: Brand medications tend to be more expensive than generics, and insurance coverage is complicated. GoodRx works with pharma manufacturers to advertise, integrate and enhance consumer awareness, access and uptake of their various savings solutions for brand medications, increasing the likelihood that a consumer will start or continue to take their prescribed medication.
 Our Offerings
 Prescription Transactions Offering
 We have built a vast network of relationships, contracts and integrations with key stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Our proprietary technology enables us to aggregate prescription pricing data points from sources spanning the healthcare industry. We structure and normalize the presentation of the data to give consumers curated, geographically relevant pricing information that is accessible through our apps or websites for free. By normalize, we refer to a process of taking the various different pricing methodologies and medication lists from each of our sources, and homogenizing the presentation of this data so that prices are directly comparable. Consumers can choose the lowest price from a selection of nearby pharmacies, save a GoodRx code to their mobile device for free and present that code at their pharmacy to access that low price.
Once a consumer has used a GoodRx code from our platform to purchase a prescription, that code is recorded in the pharmacy’s database and the consumer is not required to present their GoodRx code again for subsequent prescription refills, or, in many cases, for additional prescriptions that the consumer purchases at that pharmacy. We earn revenue upon the initial usage of the GoodRx code when the consumer realizes savings compared to the list price at the pharmacy, and we continue to earn revenue when the consumer returns to the pharmacy for refills and new prescriptions. This results in high and increasing repeat activity, which refers to the second and later use of our discounted prices by a single GoodRx consumer, on our platform. We track prices and update our database on a daily basis, which helps ensure that consumers have access to accurate prescription pricing.
Our pricing sources span the healthcare industry and include PBMs, pharmacies, pharma manufacturers, patient assistance programs, and others, making it difficult to replicate the data we possess and share with consumers. We believe it is important to work with as many of the key stakeholders of the healthcare industry as possible in order to increase the affordability options for our consumers. Our broad set of long-term relationships across the industry, combined with our proprietary platform, allows us to present highly competitive prices to consumers.
 PBMs are the most common source of pricing information. Our proprietary technology enables us to combine prices from multiple PBMs and other industry sources and display it on a single consumer interface. We believe that we maintain the largest database of aggregated pricing information across PBMs in the United States. When a transaction occurs in which one of our consumers fills a prescription and saves compared to the list price using a GoodRx code, the PBM receives a portion of the price that the consumer paid. We receive a percentage of this amount or a fixed payment from the PBM as compensation for directing the consumer to that PBM’s pricing and the pharmacy.
As we help more consumers save money on their medications and drive additional traffic through various PBMs, we increase our scale, which over time leads to lower prices for our consumers. We have steadily increased the number of PBMs with which we work over time. To date, no PBM has terminated a relationship with GoodRx, Inc. Even if a contract with a PBM were to be terminated, many of our contracts require the PBM to continue to pay us for activity by consumers originally directed to their pricing by us, even subsequent to the contract termination. The ongoing payment obligation can continue for so long as the underlying PBM-specific pricing is used, or for certain partners, for a specified multi-year period, depending on the terms of our contract with the PBM. Throughout our history, we have been able to help our consumers realize increased savings. PBM mix and relative share on our platform has varied over time as we have added new PBMs and as certain PBMs have delivered more or less favorable pricing relative to other PBMs. Even as the mix has changed, we have continued to grow and deliver a strong value proposition to our consumers. We believe that our sources of pricing are sufficiently broad and robust that the loss of any one PBM or other healthcare partner would generally result in minimal disruption in our ability to provide competitive discounts and pricing. Although the majority of our pricing information comes from PBMs, we also collect pricing data points from other sources in order to help save our consumers as much money as possible. In 2022, we began to enter into selective direct contractual agreements with pharmacies to complement the existing contractual agreements with our PBMs. We believe our hybrid approach will help us build stronger lines of communication and stronger relationships with our retailers.
Pharma Manufacturer Solutions Offering
 Brand medications tend to be expensive, and insurance coverage is complicated and may be restrictive. As a result, many consumers are not able to access or afford these medications.
 Pharma manufacturers provide affordability solutions such as co-pay cards, patient assistance programs, care portals and other savings options so that consumers can access their medications. We partner with pharma manufacturers to advertise and integrate these affordability solutions into our platform. For example, a consumer searching for a brand medication on our platform can select their insurance status and related criteria so that we can automatically determine their eligibility for specific manufacturer savings solutions, and route them to the best option.
In addition, the patient can sign up for ongoing savings alerts related to that medication. We believe our trusted brand, large volume of high intent consumers and easy-to-use interface make our platform highly attractive to pharma manufacturers. These solutions generally increase medication awareness, access and adherence and can lead to faster treatment and better patient outcomes. For example, our acquisition of vitaCare Prescription Services, Inc. ("vitaCare") in 2022 provides a pharmacy services solution that helps patients understand their coverage and identify available savings opportunities, and facilitates communication with their healthcare provider.
 Our pharma manufacturer solutions offering delivers a product that both increases overall consumer satisfaction and drives incremental consumer lifetime value at a low incremental cost to us.
 We expect to continue to grow this offering through further engagement with pharma manufacturers. We believe this offering can deliver incremental margin as we deploy these solutions across our existing base of consumers and visitors.

Subscription Offerings
 Our subscription offerings are natural extensions of our prescription transactions offering. We leverage our relationships across the healthcare ecosystem and our product expertise to provide subscribers with even greater savings and convenience at select pharmacies. We launched our first subscription offering, Gold, in 2017, and added a second offering, Kroger Savings, in 2018.
 •Gold: We offer a subscription savings program whereby subscribers generally pay a monthly or annual fee for access to even lower prices in select participating pharmacies amongst other benefits, including a mail delivery feature as well as access to discounted telehealth services.
 •Kroger Savings: We partner with Kroger, one of the largest retail pharmacies in the United States, to offer a tailored subscription product to Kroger consumers for an annual fee, a portion of which we share with Kroger. Subscribers access lower prescription prices at Kroger pharmacies. We manage key aspects of the program, including subscriber registration, consumer billing, transaction processing and marketing services under an agreement that allows subscriber enrollment through July 1, 2023 in order to continue to fully serve enrolled consumers through the expected sunset of the program in July 2024.
 Our subscription offerings are designed to be easy to use and provide subscribers with added benefits and features, such as refill reminders, price alerts and other notifications.
Telehealth Offering
 Through our GoodRx Care platform, we offer access to telehealth visits to provide consumers with quick, easy and affordable access to healthcare which are offered to patients on a cash-pay basis outside of insurance. Through GoodRx Care, we provide consumers with access to a convenient and affordable way to receive a diagnosis and a prescription online, when medically appropriate. Once they complete their online visit, consumers are able to choose to fill their prescriptions, should they receive one, at retail locations using a GoodRx code, via mail delivery through a third-party partner free of charge through Gold or by paying a small service fee. We believe our telehealth offering will continue to enhance the accessibility of our prescription and subscription offerings for consumers.
Sales & Marketing
 Consumers come to our platform organically and also through our sales and marketing initiatives. The GoodRx brand benefits from word-of-mouth recommendations to consumers from friends, healthcare professionals and pharmacists, as well as press coverage, which drives significant unpaid traffic to our apps and websites.
In addition to organic consumer acquisition, our sales and marketing efforts are designed to bring new consumers onto our platform for the first time and to re-engage existing consumers. We acquire new consumers through a variety of channels, including: (i) direct to consumer marketing which includes TV, paid search or other digital campaigns; (ii) marketing through healthcare partnerships which includes marketing materials in physician offices, integrating pricing from our platform into electronic health record providers, or EHRs, prescribing workflows so that healthcare professionals can provide prices from our platform to their patients at the point of prescribing; (iii) marketing through partnerships with other affiliates to distribute our discounts and solutions to a broader target audience outside of the healthcare ecosystem; (iv) offer incentives to certain consumers (who are not our customers) that further reduce discounted prices offered on our platform for a limited time and on a limited number of prescription drugs to attract new and re-engage existing consumers; and (v) through content creation which increases traffic to the GoodRx apps and websites such as from GoodRx Health and HealthiNation Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, which provides visitors with thousands of articles with research-backed answers to health questions and provides us with more opportunities to convert visitors to active consumers.
 We believe that we still have significant opportunities to improve our unaided awareness, to build our brand, as well as to scale existing marketing channels, and unlock new ones.
We also deploy a variety of consumer retention tools on our platform, such as savings information retained in pharmacy database so consumers do not have to re-present GoodRx codes, providing alerts and refill reminders to consumers and
links to our other offerings to improve consumer's overall experience using our platform, and strong consumer support and patient advocacy services to help consumers understand how best to afford their medication.
Our Technology
 The key elements of our technology include:
 •Proprietary Pricing Engine: Our price ingestion technology enables us to link with multiple sources spanning the healthcare industry. In addition, we have proprietary patented technology related to collecting and normalizing prices from multiple PBMs and presenting them using a single consumer interface.
 •Constant Data Refresh: Displaying our prescription- and location-specific list of prices to each consumer in near real-time requires the rapid processing of a significant amount of data, the use of complex predictive models, and sophisticated software programming and design.
 •Living Database: Our dataset becomes more comprehensive and accurate with every prescription filled. We use our proprietary algorithms to create actionable insights and continuously improve our consumer experience. Our database is central to the value that we provide to our consumers through accurate pricing and improved recommendations. We refer to our data as “living,” meaning that it is dynamic and continually being updated or refined.
 •Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning: Our engine is also able to learn from and react to changes in prescribing habits or to ensure that consumers are selecting the accurate dosing or form of a given medication. For example, our engine will automatically show the most common dose of a given medication. We also take into account pharmacy-level dispensing patterns that may impact the price of a medication, such as when two pharmacy locations that are part of the same pharmacy chain dispense the same medication, but source the medication from different manufacturers.
 •Scalable: Our digital platform is cloud native, scalable and reliable. We leverage major third-party cloud and data service providers and have built a modular system of services on top of this infrastructure.
 •Secure: Trust is critical to our relationship with both our consumers and our partners and we take security and privacy very seriously. We implement security procedures and policies informed by various industry-standard frameworks. Our operations are audited annually as part of a SOC2 audit, based on principles developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and we have obtained SOC2 certification with respect to our prescription transactions offering and subscription offerings. In addition, our security is tested through our bug-bounty program. We continue to expand our team and solutions to address emerging risks and changes in the threat landscape.
Our Growth Strategy
 The key elements of our growth strategy include:
 •Continue to Attract New Consumers: We believe that we have a significant opportunity to serve all Americans. By growing awareness of our existing offerings and through the extension of our platform into many of the other areas of healthcare that lack price transparency and consumer empowerment, we believe that we can address an increasingly larger portion of the healthcare market in the United States and fill more gaps across the healthcare journey for our consumers.
 •Continue to Facilitate Existing GoodRx Consumers’ Adoption of Multiple GoodRx Offerings: We aim to increase the number of our monetization channels used by our existing consumers. We believe that this will result in higher consumer satisfaction and be accretive to our consumer lifetime value and to our margins in the medium to long term, without significant additional consumer acquisition costs.
 •Continue to Build the GoodRx Brand: We believe that there are significant opportunities to increase awareness and educate healthcare consumers regarding prescription pricing, as well as our platform and solutions. As we continue to build our brand, we anticipate that many of the consumers who do not fully understand prescription pricing, or that are not aware of tools such as our platform, will begin using our platform.
 •Invest in Product Offerings: We plan to continue to invest in and scale our range of product offerings to better address the needs of consumers, provide them with better pricing, and improve their overall healthcare journey. We have a multi-prong approach for this strategy which includes:
 oPharma Manufacturer Solutions Offering: We believe our trusted brand, large volume of high intent consumers and easy-to-use consumer experience make our offering highly attractive to pharma manufacturers. The solutions offered by pharma manufacturers on our platform can increase the likelihood that consumers will start to take or continue to take their prescribed medication. We plan to continue to expand the number of 

pharma manufacturers with which we work, increase brand penetration, and increase the number of solutions each of them uses, as well as enhance our existing offerings and introduce new integrated technology solutions that will allow manufacturers to interact with our consumer base more effectively.
 oSubscription Offerings: We believe our subscription offerings, and our Gold subscription offering in particular, have higher lifetime value than our prescription transactions offering. We will continue to increase the value proposition for consumers by bundling various existing and new offerings in affordable and consumer-friendly subscription packages.
 oTelehealth Offering: We believe our telehealth offering contributes to the growth of our other offerings, including our prescription transactions offering and Gold. We see telehealth as an opportunity to add another key consumer entry point into our platform and create an excellent user experience.
 •Future Expansion Opportunities: We believe there are many other areas of healthcare that could benefit from the transparency and accessibility provided by our platform. While we are currently focused on scaling our existing offerings, we see attractive opportunities to deploy our expertise in markets such as clinical trials, insurance marketplaces, in person doctor visits and prescription delivery, differentiated features and services for healthcare providers such as our enhanced Provider Mode released in 2022, as part of our GoodRx for Providers platform initially launched in 2021, that provides healthcare providers with a more customized experience and tools to support patients throughout their healthcare journey, among others. As we continue to grow our brand awareness and consumer base, selling additional products and services into our large acquired base will drive an attractive incremental margin opportunity.
 •Pursue Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: We are a valuable partner to a variety of healthcare constituents. We have completed several acquisitions and entered into a number of strategic agreements over the last three years. For example, in 2022, we acquired vitaCare, which supplements and expands our pharma manufacturer solutions offering while helping to improve patients' awareness, access and adherence to affordable medication, and flipMD, Inc., which helps expand both our engagement with healthcare providers and pharma manufacturers. In addition, in 2022, we launched our collaboration with Express Scripts where eligible Express Scripts members will automatically be able to access GoodRx prices as part of their pharmacy benefit and we also began to enter into selective direct contractual agreements with pharmacies to complement the existing contractual agreements with our PBMs. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to pursue strategic opportunities, including commercial relationships and acquisitions, to strengthen our market position and enhance our capabilities.
 •Drive Shareholder Value: We are focused on delivering consistent and efficient growth by reprioritizing investments to where they are most needed while delivering to consumers what they have come to expect from GoodRx. For example, in August 2022, we implemented a reduction in force in order to consolidate functions and eliminate or reduce investment in areas of lower focus to align with our strategic goals and drive incremental margin.
 Competition and Industry Participants
 Although we have built and scaled a differentiated consumer internet platform, we face a variety of types of competition. We believe that our primary barrier to adoption is awareness. Americans have historically not had to be active consumers of healthcare since benefit plans were more generous and open than they are today. Many consumers are not aware that prices for the same prescription vary between pharmacies or that there are competitive cash prices available that may be lower than insurance prices.
 We principally compete with companies that provide prescription savings and solutions to pharma manufacturers. New entrants may also enter our industry and compete with us. Generally, we believe that we are able to compete effectively against these organizations based on our brand, scale, pricing and consumer experience. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their offerings.
 •In prescriptions discounts and price comparisons, our competition is fragmented and consists of competitors that are both larger and smaller than us in scale, including large e-commerce companies.
 •Our pharma manufacturer solutions offering competes for advertising and market access budget allocation against platforms on which manufacturers can reach consumers, including health-related websites and mobile apps, and services supporting patient access. We believe that our trusted brand and our platform allows us to engage patients about the cost of their brand medications.
 There is currently significant concentration in the U.S. healthcare industry, and in particular there are a limited number of PBMs, including pharmacies’ in-house PBMs, and a limited number of national pharmacy chains. If we are unable to retain favorable contractual arrangements with our PBMs, including any successor PBMs should there be further consolidation of
PBMs, we may lose them as customers, or the negotiated rates provided by such PBMs may become less competitive, which could have an adverse impact on our platform.
 A limited number of PBMs generate a significant percentage of the discounted prices that we present through our platform and, as a result, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with a limited number of PBMs. We work with more than a dozen PBMs that maintain cash networks and prices, and the number of PBMs we work with has significantly increased over time, limiting the extent to which any one PBM contributes to our overall revenue; however, we may not expand beyond our existing PBM partners and the number of our PBM partners may even decline. For additional information, see “We rely on a limited number of industry participants.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technology platform, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We protect our intellectual property, including our brand, through a combination of trademarks, patents, trade secrets, contractual provisions that restrict partners from infringing on our intellectual property, intellectual property assignment agreements, licensing agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as our position as the largest healthcare-focused internet platform for prescription prices and discounts, our scale and the network effects enabled by these factors, as well as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success.
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned four issued patents and three pending patent applications in the United States. One issued patent relates to our ability to combine prices from multiple PBMs together in a single consumer interface. Our issued patents begin expiring in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustment. As of December 31, 2022, we held thirteen registered trademarks in the United States, including trademarks for our brand, GoodRx, and for the use of the color yellow in the prescription discounts space. Additionally, we had two trademark applications pending as of December 31, 2022, one of which is for our new company logo. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.goodrx.com.
 We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property and we intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or that it will provide any competitive advantage. For more information regarding risks related to intellectual property, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 Philanthropy
 Philanthropy is not a separate initiative in our company; helping others is woven throughout everything we do. Throughout our history, we have provided charitable support to communities, individuals, students, clinics and non-profits in furtherance of that goal. We regularly sponsor programs and events that support people in marginalized communities or people who have challenges obtaining access to healthcare.
 In 2022, our employees worked on several initiatives to help those in underserved communities. We donated approximately $10,000 to educational and other organizations focused on providing healthcare access in Black communities. A number of our employees flew to Florida to help victims of Hurricane Ian and help deliver essential supplies, provide on-the-ground assistance, and offer financial support to those affected by the hurricane. Our employees also volunteered throughout the year at healthcare pop-ups in underserved communities and our leaders sponsored team members as they raised money for breast cancer awareness, the fight against leukemia, and other nonprofits.
In addition, through "Good To Give," our employee-led donation program, we have supported over 15 nonprofit organizations in 2022 with donations totaling approximately $100,000. Every quarter, our employees nominate and vote for nonprofit organizations and causes they believe in, to which we then make a donation. We have made financial contributions to a broad range of organizations, including those dedicated to helping our most vulnerable communities, addressing important issues like conservation, and improving healthcare access, education, and research.
 We continue to expand our commitment to equitable healthcare access through the creation of GoodRx Helps, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt public charity. This nonprofit is funded and supported by our December 2020 donation of 1.1 million shares of our Class A common stock which had an estimated fair value of $41.7 million at the time of funding. GoodRx Helps’
philanthropic mission is to help underserved communities who are unable to afford their healthcare due to systemic barriers. Since its formation, GoodRx Helps has provided free prescription medications at charitable clinics across the United States, three separate scholarship programs to support the careers of students from underrepresented groups in healthcare, and grants to mission-aligned healthcare clinics and organizations. GoodRx Helps has also hosted multiple community health pop-ups to improve access to essential healthcare services, such as primary care, health screenings, COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations, insurance enrollment assistance, and much more.
Our People and Culture
 Our people are essential to our success. We believe that advocating for and putting people first, leading with empathy, and building trust across our organization are core to our success. We prioritize providing a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people have the opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance and potential.
 In 2020 and 2021, the Los Angeles Business Journal rated us as one of the Best Places to Work. In 2022, we received eight awards by Comparably, a workplace culture data and ratings service, for Best Company Outlook, Best Company Happiness, Best Company Leadership, Best Company Los Angeles, Best Company Compensation, Best Company Perks & Benefits, Best Teams Marketing and Best Teams Engineering.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 954 employees, of which 952 are full-time and 2 are part-time employees. Of our total employees, 300 are based at our headquarters in Santa Monica, California. Our employees are split among the following departments and functions: 254 principally in customer service, 392 in product development and technology, 175 in sales and marketing, and 133 in general and administrative functions. Women make up 50% (425 employees) of our workforce who have chosen to identify their gender. Non-white employees make up 59% (546 employees) of our workforce who have chosen to identify their ethnicity/race.
 Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") are top of mind, and we strive to build a workforce that can represent the clients, customers and partners that we serve everyday. DEI considerations touch all facets of our employee lifecycle, from onboarding to experience, performance, tenure and succession planning. In January 2023, we launched 5 Community Resource Groups (CRGs) that advocate for the needs of our members across a diverse range of identities and experiences. The CRGs are expected to have appointed leads, executive sponsors, and subpillar leads for recruiting, company events and community impact. We will be rolling out enhanced training pertaining to performance management, interview and unconscious bias training. Coaching, mentorship, and building community are top of mind to foster psychological safety and collaboration. Additionally, there are a number of key partnerships that we have cultivated externally with to invest in our DEI commitment.
 In managing our business, we strive to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among our company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. Our employees are supported with training and development opportunities to pursue their career paths and to promote compliance with our policies. We adhere to our code of business conduct and ethics (the "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics"), which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect.
 We have taken and continue to take necessary actions to actively monitor risks related to COVID-19 and proper application of our safety protocol to remain aligned with federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and guidelines. Steps we have taken include our commitment to embrace both hybrid and remote working for our employees as we believe that our business continuity plan and technology platform will continue to support the effectiveness of our employees that work remotely.
We also continue to provide robust benefits, including health insurance for employees and dependents, 401(k) match, fertility benefits, paid parental leave and discretionary vacation. We foster a tight-knit corporate culture through company events, team building offsites, happy hours, game and movie nights, and pet-friendly offices. The biggest perk of all is knowing that the work performed has a meaningful impact on our consumers.

 The data we collect and process is an integral part of our products and services, allowing us to ensure our prices are accurate, surface the most relevant prices and reach and advertise to consumers with savings information. We collect and may use personal information to help run our business (including for analytical and marketing purposes) and to communicate and otherwise reach our consumers. In some instances, we may use third party service providers to assist us in the above.

We endeavor to treat our consumers’ data with respect and maintain consumer trust. We provide consumers options designed to allow them to control the use and disclosure of their data, such as allowing consumers to opt out of any marketing requests, opt out of the use of marketing cookies, pixels and technologies on our platform, and request deletion of their data.
 Since we receive, use, transmit, disclose and store personally identifiable information, including health-related information, we are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure and protection of certain types of data. Such regulations include the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, certain state data privacy and security laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act; the violation of any such laws and regulations could result in legal remedies that could materially impact our business or financial performance.
Our respect for laws and regulations regarding the collection and processing of personal data underlies our strategy to improve our customer experience and build trust. To read more about our approach to privacy laws and the regulations, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security, advertising and consumer protection laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 State Licensing Requirements
 Certain states have enacted laws regulating companies that offer and market discount medical plans, including prescription drug plans, subscription membership programs or discount cards, such as our prescription transactions offering, Gold, Kroger Savings, and any other subscription products we may develop in the future, including with respect to our telehealth offering. These state laws are intended to protect consumers from fraudulent, unfair or deceptive marketing, sales and enrollment practices by such plans. It is possible that other states may enact new requirements or interpret existing requirements to include our programs. In addition, vitaCare is also subject to licensure and certification requirements, including state licensing of pharmacies and pharmacists. Failure to obtain the required licenses, certifications or registrations to offer and market our subscription discount programs and pharmacy services may result in civil penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders, or a restructuring of our operations.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Laws
 With respect to our telehealth platform, GoodRx Care contracts with physician-owned professional entities to deliver our telehealth offering to their patients in the United States principally supported by Wheel Health, Inc.'s (“Wheel”) technology and network of clinicians. We enter into management services agreements with these physician-owned professional entities pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services. In addition, our telehealth platform enables consumers to opt in to use our prescription transactions offering and/or fill their prescriptions through a third-party mail delivery pharmacy. These relationships are subject to various state laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment, and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or a restructuring of our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities. For further information, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry—Our telehealth offering offered to consumers is subject to laws, rules and policies governing the practice of medicine and medical board oversight.” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry—In our telehealth offering, we are dependent on our relationships with affiliated professional entities, which we do not own and principally supported by our arrangement with Wheel, to provide healthcare services, and our business would be adversely affected if those relationships were disrupted.”
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Although the consumers who use our offerings do so outside of any medication or other health benefits covered under their health insurance, including any commercial or government healthcare program, we may nonetheless be subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. For further information, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry—We may be subject to state and federal fraud and abuse and other healthcare regulatory laws and regulations. If
we or our commercial partners act in a manner that violates such laws or otherwise engage in misconduct, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties as well as exclusion from government healthcare programs.”
Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. In the United States, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the costs of medication. For further information please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry—The impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
