ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Introduction

  We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 16, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). We have engaged in limited operations and have generated no operating revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no substantive operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.


On December 3, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”) of 27,600,000 units, including 3,600,000 units as a result of the underwriter’s full exercise of their over-allotment option (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock (a “Public Share”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant (a “Public Warrant”) entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $276,000,000.
 
On March 31, 2021, the Sponsor received 5,750,000 of the Company’s Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”) for a payment of $25,000 made on May 4, 2021. On November 30, 2021, the Company effected a 1.2:1 stock split for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 6,900,000 Founder Shares. As of December 3, 2021, there was 6,900,000 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, of which 6,440,000 are held by our Sponsor and the remaining 460,000 are held by certain funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to herein as “BlackRock”). The number of Founder Shares outstanding was determined based on the Company’s expectation that the total size of the Initial Public Offering would be a maximum of 27,600,000 Units if the underwriter’s over-allotment option was exercised in full, and therefore, that the Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering.
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to purchase agreements entered into with the Sponsor and Blackrock, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 15,226,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $15,226,000 (the “Private Placement”). The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor, Blackrock, or their permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not, and the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned, or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis, and (iv) under certain circumstances, are entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the Private Placement. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than the original purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company does not consummate its initial Business Combination by June 3, 2023, or by December 3, 2023 if we decide to extend the term, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.




 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $281,520,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, and to fund our working capital requirements (subject to an annual limit of $100,000), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter”) provides that none of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares related to certain amendments to our Charter, or (iii) the redemption of 100% of the Public Shares if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination by June 3, 2023, or by December 3, 2023 if we decide to extend the term. With respect to amendments to our Charter, holders of Public Shares may be entitled to redeem their Public Shares (i) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination by December 3, 2023 or (ii) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.


 After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $443,739 in Public Offering costs, approximately $3,742,261 of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. As of December 31, 2022, there was $281,521,183 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $2,579,658 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2022, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay the Company’s income taxes.


Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
 We are not presently engaged any operations intended to generate operating revenue and will not generate operating revenue for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our equity or debt, or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial Business Combination. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such a company or business.


If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our shares of Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-Business Combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will be aware of the Company and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors.
 
 We may also engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on a formal basis, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case the fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account, if there are sufficient funds remaining in the Trust Account after redemptions. If there are not sufficient funds, the finder’s fee will be paid out of the operating capital of the combined company. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finder’s fee or consulting fee prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction). We have agreed to reimburse our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, and completing an initial Business Combination. We have also agreed to pay a salary to certain officers who assist in our day to day operations and have entered into a consulting agreement with one of our directors to manage the vetting process for potential acquisition candidates. Some of our officers and directors may also enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.



 
 We may also pursue an initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that the initial Business Combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of the opinion nor will they be able to rely on the opinion. We are not required to obtain an opinion in any other context.


Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Business Combination transaction.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.
 
If our initial proposed Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a Business Combination with a different target until June 3, 2023 (or up to December 3, 2023, if applicable).
 
 Structure of an Initial Business Combination


In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. We refer to this as the “80% fair market value test.” If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of the opinion nor will they be able to rely on such an opinion. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 


 
 We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders will own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination in such a way that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of equity interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. We only intend to complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target business or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of a target, our stockholders prior to our initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target business and us in the initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares, or other equity interests of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third parties in connection with financing our initial Business Combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of the business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.


Extension of Time to Complete an Initial Business Combination

We will have until June 3, 2023 to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial Business Combination by June 3, 2023, we may extend the period to consummate a Business Combination two times by an additional three months each (until December 3, 2023 at the latest).
 
Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Trust Agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial Business Combination, our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice to us prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the Trust Account $2,760,000 ($0.10 per Public Share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline for each of the available three month extensions. A total deposit of $5,520,000 must be deposited to reach an aggregate Business Combination period extending to December 3, 2023 and the deposit may be made in cash or in the form of a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory notes. The promissory notes may be converted into warrants to purchase our Class A common stock, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Promissory notes issued to extend the applicable period that are not converted to warrants will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay the loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us if there are sufficient funds in the Trust Account after redemptions to repay the loans. If we do not complete a Business Combination or if there are not sufficient remaining funds in the Trust Account after redemptions, we will not repay the loans. Furthermore, the letter agreements with our initial shareholders contain a provision pursuant to which our Sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for promissory notes issued to extend the applicable period out of the funds held in the Trust Account in the event that we do not complete a Business Combination. We will issue a press release announcing each extension at least three days prior to the deadline for each extension and we will issue a press release the day after the deadline announcing whether the funds have been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account so that we may extend the time available for us to complete our initial Business Combination.
 
 Our public stockholders will not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial Business Combination from June 3, 2023 to December 3, 2023 at the latest as described above or redeem their shares in connection with these extensions. This feature is different than the traditional special purpose acquisition company structure, in which any extension of the Company’s period to complete a Business Combination requires a vote of the Company’s shareholders and shareholders have the right to redeem their public shares in connection with such a vote. However, our public stockholders will be entitled to vote and redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting held to approve an initial Business Combination or in a tender offer undertaken in connection with an initial Business Combination if we propose one during any three-month extension period.




 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if Initial Business Combination Not Completed
 
Our initial stockholders, executive officers, and directors have agreed, and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, that we will have only until June 3, 2023 (or up to December 3, 2023, if applicable) to complete our initial Business Combination. If we have not completed our initial Business Combination by June 3, 2023 (or at the latest by December 3, 2023, if applicable), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following the redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination.
Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide the holders of our Public Shares with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. At the completion of our initial Business Combination, we will be required to purchase any Public Shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share, and such amount will be increased by $0.10 per public share for any three-month extension of our time to consummate our initial Business Combination, as described herein. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial Business Combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our Public Shares, even if a public stockholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a Business Combination does not close. Our Sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination, and BlackRock has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by it.
Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described herein upon completion of the initial Business Combination.
 


 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. Our Sponsor, officers and directors, and Blackrock have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and our Sponsor, officers, and directors have agreed to vote any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial Business Combination. Each holder of Public Shares may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption Rights Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to excess shares without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Business Combination as a means to force the Company or management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including excess shares) for or against the Company’s initial Business Combination.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.
Employees
 
 We currently have three executive officers: John C. Backus, Jr., Steven P. Mullins, and Michael W. Zarlenga. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our business but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our business until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any given time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 11911 Freedom Drive, Suite 1080, Reston, VA 20190 or by telephone at (571) 310-4949.
