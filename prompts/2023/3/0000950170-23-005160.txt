 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 Addus has been providing home care services since 1979. We operate three segments: personal care, hospice, and home health. Our services are principally provided in-home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our consumers are predominantly “dual eligible,” meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
 As of December 31, 2022, we provided services in 22 states through approximately 202 offices. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we served approximately 66,000 and 67,000 discrete consumers, respectively.
 We continue to drive organic growth while also growing through acquisitions, focusing on growth in the states in which we have a presence while adding clinical care services to our offerings. As of December 31, 2022, we provide all three levels of care, personal care, home health and hospice services, in Ohio, Illinois and New Mexico and strategically continue to pursue other markets.
 A summary of our financial results is provided in the table below.

Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors, as appropriate. Changes in a consumer’s conditions are evaluated by appropriately trained managers, which may result in a report to the consumer’s case manager at a managed care organization or other payor. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer’s conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.
 We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States continue to implement managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and, as a result, managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.
 Our Market and Opportunity
 We provide home care services that primarily include personal care services to assist with activities of daily living, as well as hospice and home health services. These services allow the elderly and other infirm adults who require long-term care and assistance with activities of daily living to maintain their independence at home with their families. Personal care services are a significant component of home and community-based services (“HCBS”), which have grown in significance and demand in recent years and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the demand for personal care services is growing from managed care delivery models, including Medicaid Long-Term Services and Supports (“LTSS”) programs and Medicare Advantage plans. Managed care plans aim to manage cost, utilization and quality through collaboration of health insurance plans and healthcare providers. We also offer personal

care services to private pay consumers. We expect demand for HCBS to continue to grow due to the aging of the U.S. population and improved opportunities for individuals to receive home-based care as an alternative to institutional care.
 Because our model serves an aging population in a home setting at a lower cost, we believe that we have favorable opportunities for growth. Historically, there were limited barriers to entry in the home-based services industry. As a result, the personal care, home health and hospice service industries developed in a highly fragmented manner, with few large participants and many small ones. Few companies have a significant market share across multiple regions or states. The lack of licensure or certification requirements in some states makes it difficult to estimate the number of home-based services agencies. We expect ongoing consolidation within our industry, driven by the desire of healthcare systems and managed care organizations to narrow their networks of service providers, and also as a result of the industry’s increasingly complex regulatory, operating and technology requirements. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on a consolidating industry given our reputation in the market, strong payor relationships and integration of technology into our business model.
 The personal care services industry is subject to increasing regulation. At the federal level, efforts have focused on improved coordination of regulation across the various types of Medicaid programs through which personal care services are offered. Federally required state mandates include implementing electronic visit verification (“EVV”), which is used to collect home visit data, and obtaining state licenses or registrations. Providers must dedicate substantial resources to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable regulations and significant expenditures may be necessary to offer new services or to expand into new markets. We believe licensing requirements and regulations, including those related to EVV, the increasing focus on improving health outcomes, the rising cost and complexity of operations and technology and pressure on reimbursement rates due to constrained government resources may discourage new providers and may encourage industry consolidation.
 The Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office (“MMCO”) was established within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to improve services for consumers who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, also known as “dual eligibles,” and improve coordination between the federal government and states to enhance access to quality services to which they are entitled. The MMCO works with state Medicaid agencies, other federal and state agencies, physicians and others, to make available technical assistance and educational tools to improve care coordination between Medicare and Medicaid and to reduce costs and improve beneficiary experience while reducing administrative and regulatory barriers between the programs. In addition, the MMCO and the CMS Innovation Center are considering or have implemented demonstration projects affecting reimbursement for services provided to dual eligibles.
 We believe that our personal care program and our technology make us well-suited to partner with managed care organizations to address the needs of the “dual eligible” population, and we believe that our ability to identify changes in our consumers’ health and condition before acute intervention is required will lower the overall cost of care. We believe this approach to care delivery and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum are particularly attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs of our consumers and over time will increase our business with them.
 Our Growth Strategy
 The growth of our revenues is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services. Our continued growth depends on our ability to provide consistently high-quality care, maintain our existing payor relationships, establish relationships with new payors, increase our referral sources and attract and retain caregivers. Our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services. We believe there are several market opportunities for growth as the population ages. Moreover, individuals generally prefer to receive care in their homes, and we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened this preference due to health concerns that may be associated with institutional settings for long-term care, along with concerns about the re-imposition of visitor restrictions that were imposed in many long-term care facilities in response to the pandemic. Finally, we believe the provision of home-based services is more cost-effective than the provision of similar services in institutional settings for long-term care. We plan to continue our revenue growth and margin improvement and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following growth strategies:
Consistently Provide High-Quality Care
 We schedule and require our caregivers to perform their services as defined within the individual plan of care. We monitor the performance of our caregivers through regular supervisory visits in the homes of consumers. Our caregivers are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, caregivers are also required to attend ongoing in-service education. In certain states, our caregivers are required to complete certified training programs and maintain a state certification. The training assists our caregivers with identifying changes in our consumers’ health and condition before acute intervention is required, which we believe lowers the overall cost of care.
Drive Organic Growth in Existing Markets
 We intend to drive organic growth through several initiatives, including continuing to build and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities, enhancing our business intelligence analytic capabilities, recruiting and retaining employees and investing in technology and operations to drive efficiencies. We also expect our organic growth will benefit from an increase in demand for our services by an aging population and our increased alignment with referral sources and payors. We continue to selectively open new offices in existing markets when an opportunity is identified and appropriate.
Market to Managed Care Organizations
 As a large-scale provider of home-based care, we are partnering with managed care organizations, taking advantage of an industry shift from traditional fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid and toward managed care models, which aim to better coordinate care. We expect this shift to lead to narrower provider networks where we can be competitive by offering a larger, more experienced partner to these organizations, as well as by providing more sophisticated technology, electronic visit records and an outcomes-driven approach to service. We believe our coordinated care model and integration of services into the broader healthcare industry are particularly attractive to managed care organizations. In particular, our expansion from primarily personal care services into hospice and home health has increased our value to our managed care partners by diversifying our home-based care offerings.
Grow Through Acquisitions
 In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new markets. We completed two acquisitions in 2022, despite the continuing challenges and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic: JourneyCare Inc. (“JourneyCare”) on February 1, 2022 and Apple Home Healthcare, LTD (“Apple Home”) on October 1, 2022. Acquisitions completed in 2022 accounted for $48.7 million in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. We also completed two acquisitions in 2021: Armada Skilled Homecare of New Mexico LLC, Armada Hospice of New Mexico LLC and Armada Hospice of Santa Fe LLC (collectively, “Armada”) on August 1, 2021 and Summit Home Health, LLC (“Summit”) on October 1, 2021.
 Our active pipeline and strong financial position support additional acquisitions. With rising consolidation pressures in the industry, our focus is on identifying growing markets with favorable demographics in states that are fiscally well managed and have a reasonable minimum wage environment and where we have the potential to become one of the leading providers in the state in order to support our managed care organization strategy. We believe our experience identifying and executing on opportunities generated by our acquisition pipeline, as well as our history of integrating acquisitions, will lead to additional growth.
 Our Services
 We operate three business segments: personal care, hospice and home health. Without our services, many of our consumers would be at increased risk of placement in a long-term care institution.
Personal Care
 Our personal care segment provides non-medical assistance with activities of daily living, primarily to persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled. The services we provide include assistance with bathing, grooming, oral care, feeding and dressing, medication reminders, meal planning and preparation, housekeeping and transportation services. Many consumers need such services on a long-term basis to address chronic or acute conditions. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities. Each payor client establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, and establishes the applicable reimbursement rate in accordance with applicable laws, regulations or contracts.
Hospice
 Our hospice segment provides physical, emotional and spiritual care for people who are terminally ill as well as related services for their families. The hospice services we provide include palliative nursing care, social work, spiritual counseling, homemaker services and bereavement counseling. Generally, patients receiving hospice services have a life expectancy of six months or less.
Home Health
 Our home health segment provides services that are primarily medical in nature to individuals who may require assistance during an illness or after hospitalization and include skilled nursing and physical, occupational and speech therapy. We generally provide home health services on a short-term, intermittent or episodic basis to individuals, typically to assist patients recovering from an illness or injury.
 We measure the performance of each segment using a number of different metrics. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” for information regarding the Company’s segment metrics.
Our Payors
 Our payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative and budgetary restrictions, changes and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. Managed care organizations that operate as an extension of government payors are subject to similar economic pressures. Our commercial insurance payor clients are typically for-profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.
 Most of our services are provided pursuant to agreements with state and local governmental social and aging service agencies. These agreements generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated with 60 days’ notice. They are typically renewed for one to five-year terms, provided that we have complied with licensing, certification and program standards, and other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Managed care organizations are becoming an increasing portion of our personal care segment payor mix as states shift from administering fee-for-service programs to utilizing managed care models. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” for our revenue mix by payor type.
Competition
 We believe our industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market specific. Each local market has its own competitive profile and no single competitor has significant market share across all of our markets. Our competition consists of personal care service providers, home health providers, hospice providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations, managed care organizations and self-directed care programs. In addition, certain governmental payors contract with other providers for services we offer. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into our markets. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, as well as name recognition with consumers and payors.
Sales and Marketing
 We focus on initiating and maintaining working relationships with state and local governmental agencies responsible for the provision of the services we offer. We target these agencies in our current markets and in geographical areas that we have identified as potential markets for expansion. We also seek to identify service needs or changes in the service delivery or reimbursement systems of governmental entities and attempt to work with and provide input to the responsible government personnel, provider associations and consumer advocacy groups.
 We establish new referral relationships with various managed care organizations that contract with the states to service the Medicaid programs. We have met with many contracted managed care organizations in markets we serve and believe we are building the relationships necessary to generate continued referrals of new clients.
 We receive substantially all of our personal care consumers through third-party referrals, including state departments on aging, rehabilitation, mental health and children’s services, county departments of social services, managed care organizations, the Veterans Health Administration and city departments on aging. Generally, family members of potential consumers are made aware of available in-home or alternative living arrangements through state or local case management systems. These systems are operated by governmental or private agencies.


We provide ongoing education and outreach in our target communities in order to inform the community about state and locally-subsidized care options and to communicate our role in providing quality personal care services. We also utilize consumer-directed sales, marketing and advertising programs designed to attract consumers.
 With respect to our hospice and home health patients, we receive substantially all of our referrals through other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and assisted living facilities. We have a team of community liaisons in our hospice and home health operations that educate and develop relationships with other healthcare providers and the community at large.
 Payment for Services
 We are reimbursed for substantially all of our services by federal, state and local government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid state programs, managed care organizations, other state agencies and the Veterans Health Administration. In addition, we are reimbursed by commercial insurance and private pay consumers. Depending on the type of service, coverage for services may be predicated on a case manager, physician or nurse determination that the care is necessary or on the development of a plan for care in the home.
Medicare
 Medicare is a federal program that provides medical services to persons aged 65 or older and other qualified persons with disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Each of our hospice and home care agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program in order to continue receiving Medicare reimbursement.
Hospice
 Medicare beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of six months or less may elect to receive hospice benefits (i.e., palliative services for management of a terminal illness) in lieu of standard Medicare coverage for treatment. Hospice services are paid under the Medicare Hospice Prospective Payment System (“HPPS”), under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in the hospice benefit. CMS requires hospice providers to submit quality reporting data each year and updates hospice payment rates annually using a market basket index. Hospices that do not satisfy quality reporting requirements are subject to a 2 percentage point reduction to the market basket percentage update. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2024, the reduction to the market basket update for failure to satisfy quality reporting requirements will increase to 4 percentage points. Additionally, hospice providers are subject to two specific payment limit caps under the Medicare program each federal fiscal year: the inpatient cap and the aggregate cap, as discussed further in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Home Health
 CMS reimburses home health agencies under a prospective payment system, paying a national, standardized 30-day period payment rate if a period of care meets a threshold of home health visits. The daily home health payment rate is adjusted for case-mix and area wage levels. CMS uses the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”) as the case-mix classification model to place periods of care into payment categories, classifying patients based on clinical characteristics. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods of care in which costs exceed a specific threshold amount. CMS updates home health payment rates annually using a market basket index. Home health agencies that do not submit required quality data are subject to a 2 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. In addition, CMS began implementing a nationwide expansion of the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (“HHVBP”) Model in January 2022. Under the HHVBP Model, home health agencies will receive increases or reductions to their Medicare fee-for-service payments of up to 5% based on performance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of other home health providers. Data collected in each performance year will impact Medicare payments two years later. Calendar year 2023 is the first performance year under the expanded HHVBP Model, which will affect payments in calendar year 2025.
Medicare requires home health agencies to submit a one-time Notice of Admission (“NOA”) for each patient that establishes that the beneficiary is under a Medicare home health period of care. Failure to submit the NOA within five calendar days from the start of care date will result in a reduction to the 30-day period payment amount for each day from the start of care date until the date the NOA is submitted.
Medicaid Programs
 Medicaid is a state-administered program that provides certain social and medical services to qualified low-income individuals and is jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Rates are subject to adjustment based on statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, government funding limitations and interpretations of policy by individual state agencies. Within guidelines established by federal statutes and regulations, and subject to federal oversight, each state establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, sets the rate of payment for services and administers its own program. States typically cover intermittent home health services for Medicaid beneficiaries, but cover continuous services for children and young adults with complicated medical conditions and home and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities.
 Payment models vary by state. Currently, home health services are often reimbursed by state Medicaid programs on a fee-for-service basis. For hospice services, the state pays an amount for each day that a beneficiary is under the care of a hospice provider based on the type and intensity of services furnished. Many states are moving the administration of their Medicaid hospice and home healthcare programs to managed care organizations in order to effectively manage costs.
 Currently, personal care services and other HCBS are largely reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. Some states have received permission from CMS to provide HCBS under waivers of traditional Medicaid requirements. In an effort to control escalating Medicaid costs, states are increasingly requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans for better coordination of HCBS and healthcare services. For example, over three-quarters of Medicaid beneficiaries in Illinois are a part of the Health Choice Illinois statewide managed care program, which is serviced by various managed care organizations. Reimbursement from the managed care organizations for personal care services is generally on an hourly, fee-for-service basis with rates consistent with or as a percentage of the individual state funded rates, where applicable.
 Illinois Department on Aging
 A significant amount of our net service revenues from our personal care segment are derived from once specific payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 20.7% and 21.4% of our net service revenues for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Illinois Department on Aging coordinates programs and community-based services intended to improve quality of life and preserve the independence of older individuals. The Illinois Department on Aging is funded by Medicaid, Illinois’s Commitment to Human Services Fund, and general revenue funds of the state of Illinois, and also receives funding available under the federal Older Americans Act (“OAA”). The Department on Aging’s Community Care Program (“CCP”) provides adult day services, emergency home response and in-home services, which consist of personal care services, to individuals who are age 60 and over and meet other eligibility requirements. Some of these services are provided through Medicaid waivers granted by CMS.
 Consumers are identified by “care coordinators” contracted independently with the Illinois Department on Aging. Once a consumer has been evaluated and determined to be eligible for a program, an assigned care coordinator refers the consumer to a list of authorized providers, from which the consumer selects the provider. We provide our services in accordance with a care plan developed by the care coordinator and under administrative directives from the Illinois Department on Aging. We are reimbursed on an hourly fee-for-service basis.
 Veterans Health Administration
 The Veterans Health Administration operates the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system, with more than 1,200 healthcare facilities, and provides healthcare benefits, including personal care, hospice and home health services, to eligible military veterans. The Veterans Health Administration provides funding to regional and local offices and facilities that support the in-home care needs of eligible aged and disabled veterans. Services are funded by local Veterans Medical Centers and the aid and attendance pension, which reimburses veterans for their otherwise unreimbursed health and long-term care expenses. We currently have relationships and agreements with the Veterans Health Administration to provide personal care services in several states, principally in New Mexico, Illinois and California.
Other
 Other sources of funding are available to support personal care, hospice and home health services in different states and localities. For example, many states appropriate general funds or special use funds through targeted taxes or lotteries to finance personal care services for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. Depending on the state, these funds may be used to supplement existing Medicaid programs or for distinct programs that serve non-Medicaid eligible consumers.
Commercial Insurance
 Most long-term care insurance policies contain benefits for in-home services. Policies are generally subject to dollar limitations on the amount of daily, weekly or monthly coverage provided.
Private Pay
 Our private pay services are provided on an hourly or type of services basis. Our rates are established to achieve a pre-determined gross margin, and are competitive with those of other local providers. We bill our private pay consumers for services rendered weekly, bi-monthly or monthly. Other private payors include workers’ compensation programs/insurance, preferred provider organizations and employers.
Insurance Programs and Costs
 We maintain workers’ compensation, general and professional liability, cyber, automobile, directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability and excess liability insurance. We offer various health insurance plans to eligible full-time and part-time employees. We believe our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves are adequate for our current operations. However, we cannot be certain that any potential losses or asserted claims will not exceed such insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves.
Human Capital
 The following is a breakdown of our part- and full-time employees, including the employees in our corporate support center, as of December 31, 2022:
 

 | Full-time | | Part-time | | Total
Caregivers and agency staff | | 5,835 | | 26,892 | | 32,727
Corporate support centers | | 449 | | 6 | | 455 
 | | 6,284 | | 26,898 | | 33,182

 
Our caregivers, excluding agency staff, provide substantially all of our services and comprise approximately 94.4% of our total workforce. They undergo a criminal background check and are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, caregivers are also required to attend ongoing in-service education. In certain states, our caregivers are required to complete certified training programs and maintain a state certification. Approximately 51.4% of our total employees are represented by labor unions. We maintain strong working relationships with these labor unions. We have numerous collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”), which are renegotiated from time to time.
 We value our employees and believe they are the reason for our success. We strive to provide the following, among other things.
Employee Health and Safety
 Addus continues to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We recognize the importance of employee health and well-being, which can be assessed by measures such as employee satisfaction, work-related injuries and access to healthcare services. Our benefits strategy is to provide an attractive package for our eligible employees with quality care choices that fit their needs. Along with health insurance, we provide a number of benefits to encourage and support the health and safety of our employees, such as dental and vision insurance, disability and life insurance, a 401(k) plan and an employee assistance program.
  The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced for us the importance of keeping our employees and the personnel provided by independent contractors safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so that they can more safely and effectively perform their work. We have recognized the challenges presented by the pandemic and have adjusted our operations to comply with health and safety standards, regulations and guidance provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the United States Department of Labor and other regulatory bodies that focus on the safety of employees.
Recruiting and Development
 Employee recruiting and retention remains a top priority each year for Addus, as we are committed to hiring and retaining excellent employees. As the labor market continues to be tight and unemployment has remained at low levels, the competition for new caregivers continues to be significant, which will continue to impact our ability to attract and retain new caregivers.
We believe that a strong workplace culture focused on employee engagement enables ongoing learning and promotes the development of individual career growth, necessary to successfully retain and develop diverse talent. Addus recognizes the importance of employee engagement and we have implemented programs focused on new hire experiences and integration, ongoing learning opportunities though the Addus Learning Academy and Addus Institute of Skilled Care Education (“AISCE”), and mentoring through leadership training. The Addus Learning Academy allows employees to access training and resources necessary to build the skills specifically related to their respective positions at Addus. AISCE provides continuing education courses to support licensing and re-certification for our clinical employees.
Communication and Recognition
 We are committed to fostering employee satisfaction and wellness through employee recognition programs, communications and services. We have developed two primary communication tools to distribute information to our branches and administrative employees, the SC Connect and Addus Ink newsletters. Addus Ink is a quarterly newsletter that features local branch content from around the country that is focused on fulfilling our Addus Mission and Values. SC Connect is a biweekly newsletter that features important Company updates, information and resources. We have also implemented the Addus Elite Program, which has three levels of recognition; peer to peer, quarterly recognition and Addus Elite Hall of Fame, designed to celebrate the amazing work our employees do on a daily basis. We believe it is important to acknowledge our colleagues, managers, and direct reports who are living our Addus mission and values every day.
Community Outreach
 We are committed to efforts to make a difference in our communities. Our local investments include providing monetary and personnel contributions to faith based organizations, public housing authorities, public school systems and other non-profit community organizations. For example, we partner with organizations such as The Hope Foundation, which provides resources to families in need of additional help outside of the hospice benefit; the National Minority Health Association, which seeks to mobilize homecare workers to increase vaccination confidence and rates in underserved communities through its Flex for Checks community-based program; and National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, a network of agencies responsible for local planning of home and community based services delivered to older Americans. Additionally, our employees are involved in various local events such as taking part in town parades, holding food drives and providing health and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to first responders.
Technology
 We currently utilize multiple applications to support our various lines of business and locations for patient accounting. Each application supports its respective line of business and locations with administrative, office, clinical and operating information system needs, including compliance of our operating systems with federal and state privacy, security and interoperability requirements. Each assists our staff in gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimize financial performance, promote regulatory compliance and enhance staff efficiency. Each application is hosted by the vendor in a secure data center, which provides multiple redundancies for storage, power, bandwidth and security.
 In order to comply with current and future state and federal laws and regulations around EVV use, we utilize several different vendors and have built interfaces between the EVV vendor and the patient accounting system utilized in the respective branch location. Our caregivers use a mix of Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) and mobile applications for EVV. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a scheduled shift, track mileage reimbursement, send text messages to the caregivers and communicate basic payroll information.
 We license the Qlik Business Intelligence (“Qlik”) platform to provide historical, current, and forward-looking operational performance analysis. We currently have our personal care and hospice segments integrated into Qlik. Qlik provides high-level historical and current analytical views to measure performance against budget and deliver insight into the various factors driving our execution against our financial, operational, and compliance goals. This analysis is available in summary and detailed views to accommodate user needs at all levels, from senior management to operators in the field.
 We utilize the ADP Vantage Suite as our base human resources and payroll processing system and use their services and products to manage our leave of absence processes, benefits, 401(k) and flexible spending account administration, garnishment

services, payroll tax filings, ACA compliance and filings, and time and attendance. For financial management, we utilize Oracle’s Planning Budgeting Cloud Service as our solution for budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting and Oracle Fusion for the general ledger, accounts payable and fixed assets.
 Government Regulation
 Overview
 Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Changes in the laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may have a material impact on the definition of permissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payment for care by both governmental and other payors. In addition, differences among state laws may impede our ability to expand into certain markets. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer administrative civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines, the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal or state programs. In addition, the healthcare industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, extensive and dynamic change. It is difficult to predict the effect of these changes on budgetary allocations for our services. See further discussion at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—“Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Medicare and Medicaid Participation
 To participate in and qualify for reimbursement under Medicare, our home health agencies and hospices must comply with extensive conditions of participation. Likewise, to participate in Medicaid programs, our personal care services, home health agencies and hospices are subject to various requirements imposed by federal and state authorities. If we were to violate the applicable federal and state regulations governing Medicare or Medicaid participation, we could be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and be subject to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
Healthcare Reform
 The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and economic influences at the federal and state level that may affect our business. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes, many of which have been aimed at reducing costs and government spending and increasing access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the HealthCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The ACA increased health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. The law has been, and continues to be, subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. Although the current presidential administration has indicated its intent to protect the ACA, it is possible that there may be continued changes to the ACA, its implementation or interpretation.
 States continue to explore payment and delivery reform initiatives, including quality of care incentives. Some states use or have applied to use Medicaid waivers granted by CMS to implement the ACA’s Medicaid expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. Some of these program changes may reduce the number of Medicaid enrollees in certain states. For example, Georgia intends to impose work and community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program that is expected to launch in mid-2023, while the current presidential administration and several courts have rejected similar initiatives in other states, making it difficult to predict the nature and success of potential changes. In addition, enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design.
 The CMS Innovation Center tests innovative payment and service delivery systems to reduce Medicare and Medicaid program expenditures while maintaining or enhancing quality. For example, the CMS Innovation Center has supported testing of new models of care for “dual eligibles,” funding of home health providers that offer chronic care management services, and establishment of pilot programs that bundle acute care hospital services with physician services and post-acute care services, which may include home health services for certain patients. In addition, the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”) requires HHS, in conjunction with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, to work toward a unified post-acute care payment model for post-acute care services. Currently, home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care hospitals are reimbursed under four distinct Medicare payment systems. In contrast, a unified post-acute care payment model would pay these post-acute care providers under a single framework according to a patient’s characteristics, rather than the post-acute care setting where the patient receives treatment. As required by the IMPACT Act, CMS and the HHS Office of the

Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation issued a report in July 2022, presenting an initial prototype. CMS noted in its report the need for additional analyses and acknowledged that the universal implementation of a unified post-acute care Medicare payment system would require congressional action. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission is required to submit a proposal by June 2023. It is difficult to predict the nature and success of these and other future financial or delivery system reforms implemented by Congress, HHS, the CMS Innovation Center and other industry participants, but any such changes could have a material impact on our business.
 Other recent reform initiatives and proposals at the federal and state levels include those focused on price transparency, which may impact prices and the relationships between providers, patients, and payors. For example, among other consumer protections, the No Surprises Act imposes various requirements on providers and health plans intended to prevent “surprise” medical bills. It requires providers to send an insured patient’s health plan a good faith estimate of expected charges, including billing and diagnostic codes, prior to when the patient is scheduled to receive the item or service. HHS is deferring enforcement of the good faith estimate requirement for insured patients until it issues additional regulations. The No Surprises Act also generally requires providers to provide a good faith estimate of expected charges to uninsured or self-pay individuals in advance of the scheduled services or upon request. HHS is delaying enforcement with regard to good faith estimates that do not include expected charges for co-providers or co-facilities until the agency issues additional regulations. A number of states have adopted their own healthcare price transparency requirements. In addition, trends toward transparency and value-based pricing may impact our competitive position and patient volumes. For example, the CMS Care Compare website makes publicly available certain data on home health agency and hospice performance on quality measures and patient satisfaction. Further, Medicare reimbursement is tied to reporting of quality measures.
 There is uncertainty regarding the potential impact of health reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor models. Some states have implemented or are considering measures such as individual health insurance mandates and public health insurance options. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. Health reform initiatives and proposals from the government or the private sector may impact prices, our relationships with patients, payers or ancillary providers, and our competitive position, among other effects.
 Permits, Licensure and Certificate of Need
 Our hospice, home health and personal care services are authorized and/or licensed under various state and county requirements, which cover a variety of topics including standards regarding the provision of medical or care services, clinical records, personnel, infection control and care plans. Additionally, healthcare professionals at our agencies are required to be individually licensed or certified under state law. Although our personal care service caregivers are generally not subject to licensure requirements, certain states require them to complete pre- and post-employment training programs, background checks, and, in certain instances, maintain state certification. We believe we are currently licensed appropriately as required by the laws of the states in which we operate in all material respects, but additional licensing requirements may be imposed upon us in existing markets or markets that we enter in the future.
 Some states also require a provider to obtain a certificate of need or permit of approval (“CON”) before establishing, constructing, acquiring or expanding certain health services, operations or facilities or making certain capital expenditures. These requirements are intended to avoid unnecessary duplication of services. In order to obtain a CON, a state health planning agency must determine that a need exists for the project.
 Fraud and Abuse Laws
 The laws and regulations governing our operations, including the terms of participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, impose certain requirements and limitations on our operations, business arrangements and our interactions with providers and consumers. These laws include, but are not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark law, the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, other federal and state fraud and abuse, insurance fraud, and fee-splitting laws, which may extend to services reimbursable by any payer, including private insurers.
 The fraud and abuse laws and regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback statute, which prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal healthcare program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals.


•The federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements, if these entities provide certain “designated health services” (including home health services) reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis.
 •The federal FCA and similar state laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of false claims or statements. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors and billing for services not provided. Among the many other potential bases for liability is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. The federal government has taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. The FCA may be enforced directly by the federal government or by a whistleblower on the government’s behalf.
 •The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other conduct, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a healthcare provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal healthcare program, billing for services not rendered or for medically unnecessary services, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, and the failure to return overpayments in a timely manner.
 •State anti-kickback and self-referral provisions, false claims laws, insurance fraud laws, and fee-splitting laws. The scope and interpretation of these state laws vary, and in some cases apply to items or services reimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers. For instance, the Illinois Insurance Claims Fraud Prevention Act penalizes the knowing offer or payment of remuneration to induce a person to procure client or patients under a contract of insurance, including commercial insurance plans. 
 Penalties for violation of various fraud and abuse laws or other failure to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs may result in criminal penalties, civil sanctions, including substantial civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
 Payment Integrity
 We are subject to routine and periodic surveys and audits by various governmental agencies and other payors. From time to time, we receive and respond to survey reports containing statements of deficiencies. Periodic and random audits conducted or directed by these agencies could result in a delay in receipt or an adjustment to the amount of reimbursements due or received under federal or state programs and could result in referrals to other agencies to investigate and/or prosecute potential fraud or abuse.
 CMS and state Medicaid agencies contract with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicaid and Medicare programs through reviews of quality concerns and detections and corrections of improper payments. For example, CMS and state Medicaid agencies contract with recovery audit contractors (“RACs”) on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. The RAC program’s scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. In addition, CMS engages unified program integrity contractors (“UPICS”) to perform proactive analysis, audits, investigations and other program integrity functions across the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the goal of identifying and deterring fraud and abuse to avoid improper payments. Working across five geographic jurisdictions, UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as HHS, issue pronouncements that identify practices and provider types that may be subject to heightened scrutiny, as well as practices that may violate fraud and abuse laws. We believe, but cannot assure you, that our operations comply with the principles expressed by HHS in these reports, advisories and guidance.


HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security and Data Exchange Requirements
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain healthcare claims and reimbursement payment transactions submitted or received electronically. HIPAA extensively regulates the use, disclosure, confidentiality, availability and integrity of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and provides for a number of individual rights with respect to such information. As a “covered entity” subject to HIPAA, we are required to maintain privacy and security policies, train workforce members, maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, enter into confidentiality agreements with vendors that handle protected health information (“business associates”), and permit individuals to access and amend their protected health information. In addition, we must report any breaches of unsecured protected health information. HIPAA violations may result in criminal penalties and significant civil penalties. Other federal and state laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data, such as the California Consumer Protection Act, which was recently significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, may impose additional or inconsistent obligations and/or result in additional penalties. Virginia and certain other states have also passed comprehensive privacy legislation, and several privacy bills have been proposed both at the federal and state level that may result in additional legal requirements that impact our business. The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to comply. Healthcare providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information, including prohibitions on information blocking.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
 We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, transport, use and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. In the event of an accident involving such hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all.
 In addition, we could be affected by climate change to the extent that climate change results in severe weather conditions or other disruptions impacting the communities in which we conduct operations or adversely impacts general economic conditions, including in communities in which we conduct operations. Moreover, legal requirements regulating greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise associated with the transition to a lower carbon economy may increase in the future, which could increase our costs associated with compliance and otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations. At the current time, our compliance with environmental legal requirements, including legal requirements relating to climate change, do not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial results or operations, and we did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental matters during the year ended December 31, 2022. However, it is possible that future environmental-related developments may impact us, including as a result of climate change and/or new legal requirements associated with the transition to a lower carbon economy, in a manner that we are currently unable to predict.
