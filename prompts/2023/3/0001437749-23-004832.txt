ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We have strategically transitioned from a refrigerated long-haul carrier to a multifaceted business offering a network of refrigerated and dry truck-based transportation capabilities across our five distinct business platforms – Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, Brokerage and MRTN de Mexico. We are one of the leading temperature-sensitive truckload carriers in the United States, specializing in transporting and distributing food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment. In 2022, we generated $1.264 billion in operating revenue. Approximately 58% of our Truckload and Dedicated revenue in 2022 resulted from hauling temperature-sensitive products and 42% from hauling dry freight. We operate throughout the United States and in parts of Mexico and Canada, with our revenue primarily generated from within the United States. We provide regional truckload carrier services in the Southeast, West Coast, Midwest, South Central and Northeast regions. Our primary medium-to-long-haul traffic lanes are between the Midwest and the West Coast, Southwest, Southeast, and the East Coast, as well as from California to the Pacific Northwest. In 2022, our average length of haul was 412 miles.
 
Our growth strategy is to expand our business organically by offering shippers a high level of service and significant freight capacity. We market primarily to shippers that offer consistent volumes of freight in the lanes we prefer and are willing to compensate us for a high level of service. With our fleet of 3,660 company and independent contractor tractors, we offer service levels that include up to 99% on-time performance and delivery within the narrow time windows often required when shipping perishable commodities.
 
We have four reporting segments – Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage. Financial information regarding these segments can be found in Footnote 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
Our Truckload segment provides a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. Our agreements with customers are typically for one year.
 
Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet each individual customer’s requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews.
 
Our Intermodal segment transports our customers’ freight within the United States utilizing our refrigerated containers and our temperature-controlled trailers, each on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers.

Our Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities.
 
Operating results of our MRTN de Mexico business which offers our customers door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico with our Mexican partner carriers is reported within our Truckload and Brokerage segments.
 
Organized under Wisconsin law in 1970, we are a successor to a sole proprietorship Roger R. Marten founded in 1946. In 1988, we reincorporated under Delaware law. Our executive offices are located at 129 Marten Street, Mondovi, Wisconsin 54755. Our telephone number is (715) 926-4216.
 
We maintain a website at www.marten.com. We are not including the information contained on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We post on our website, free of charge, documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC. We also provide a link on our website to Forms 3, 4 and 5 that our officers, directors and 10% stockholders file with the SEC pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
Marketing and Operations
 
We approach our business as an integrated effort of marketing and operations. We target food and consumer packaged goods companies whose products require temperature-sensitive services and who ship multiple truckloads per week. By emphasizing high-quality service, we seek to become a core carrier for our customers. In 2022, our largest customer was Walmart.
 
Our marketing efforts are conducted by a staff of 292 sales, customer service and support personnel under the supervision of our senior management team. Marketing personnel travel within their regions to solicit new customers and maintain contact with existing customers. Customer service managers regularly contact customers to solicit additional business on a load-by-load basis.
 
Our operations and sales personnel strive to improve our asset productivity by seeking freight that allows for rapid turnaround times, minimizes non-revenue miles between loads, and carries a favorable rate structure. Once we have established a customer relationship, customer service managers work closely with our fleet managers to match customer needs with our capacity and the location of revenue equipment. Fleet managers use our optimization system to assign loads to satisfy customer and operational requirements, as well as to meet the routing needs of our drivers. We attempt to route most of our trucks over selected operating lanes, which we believe assists us in meeting customer requirements, balancing traffic, reducing non-revenue miles, and improving the reliability of delivery schedules.
 
We employ technology in our operations when we believe that it will allow us to operate more efficiently and the investment is cost-justified. Examples of the technologies we employ include:
 

● | Terrestrial based tracking and messaging that allows us to communicate with our drivers, obtain load position updates, provide our customers with freight visibility, and download operating information such as fuel mileage and idling time for the tractor engines and temperature setting and run time for the temperature-control units on our trailers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic data interchange and internet communication with customers concerning freight tendering, invoices, shipment status, and other information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic logging devices in our tractors to monitor drivers’ hours of service.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Auxiliary power units installed on our company-owned tractors that allow us to decrease fuel costs associated with idling our tractors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Fuel-routing software that optimizes the fuel stops for each trip to take advantage of volume discounts available in our fuel network.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe this integrated approach to our marketing and operations, coupled with our use of technology, has allowed us to provide our customers with a high level of service and support our revenue growth in an efficient manner. For example, we produced a non-revenue mile percentage of 6.4% during 2022, which points to the efficiency of our operations and we believe compares favorably to other temperature-sensitive and dry van trucking companies.
 
Major Customers
 
A significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers. In 2022, our top 30 customers accounted for approximately 68% of our revenue excluding fuel surcharges, and our top ten customers accounted for 45% of our revenue. We have emphasized increasing our customer diversity which is shown by the decrease in the portion of our revenue with our top customers. In 2010, our top 30 customers accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue. Seven of our top ten customers have been significant customers of ours for the last ten years. We believe we are the largest or second largest temperature-sensitive carrier for five of our top ten customers. We believe our relationships with these key customers are sound, but we are dependent upon them and the loss of some or all of their business could have a materially adverse effect on our results.
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 4,575 employees. This total consists of 3,577 drivers, 330 mechanics and maintenance personnel, and 668 support personnel, which includes management and administration. As of that date, we also contracted with 96 independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
 
We believe our employees are a critical part to the continued success of our operations. Our business model depends on the efforts of our support personnel to efficiently and effectively coordinate transportation services for our customers and on the efforts of our drivers to timely and safely execute the delivery of our customers’ cargo. Competition in the trucking industry for qualified drivers is normally intense and has increased. Our operations have been impacted, and from time-to-time we have experienced under-utilization and increased expense, as a result of a shortage of qualified drivers. As such, we dedicate significant attention to hiring and retaining talented employees to manage, support and execute our operations and place a high priority on the recruitment and retention of an adequate supply of qualified drivers, and on minimizing turnover of our company-employed drivers and independent contractors. As part of those efforts, we are also committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace.
 
We believe we provide our employees with compensation and benefits that are competitive with or exceed our industry peers. We primarily pay company-employed drivers a fixed rate per mile. The rate increases based on length of service. We also compensate drivers for all detention time, for inclement weather and for road service delays. Total weekly compensation is also subject to a guaranteed minimum amount. We pay independent contractors a fixed rate per mile. Independent contractors pay for their own fuel, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.
 
The health and well-being of our employees is paramount to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance the well-being of all our employees. The COVID-19 pandemic has also heightened our responsibility of ensuring our employees have a safe work environment and we have implemented numerous efforts to keep our valued employees safe, healthy and informed. We believe that maintaining a healthy, safe and productive professional driver group is essential to providing excellent customer service and achieving profitability. We select drivers, including independent contractors, using our specific guidelines for safety records, including drivers’ Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, scores, driving experience, and personal evaluations. We maintain stringent screening, training, and testing procedures for our drivers to reduce the potential for accidents and the corresponding costs of insurance and claims. We train new drivers at a number of our terminals in all phases of our policies and operations, as well as in safety techniques and fuel-efficient operation of the equipment. All new drivers also must pass DOT required tests prior to assignment to a vehicle.

Revenue Equipment
 
Our revenue equipment programs are an important part of our overall goal of profitable growth. We evaluate our equipment decisions based on factors such as initial cost, useful life, warranty terms, expected maintenance costs, fuel economy, driver comfort, customer needs, manufacturer support, and resale value. We generally operate newer, well-maintained equipment with uniform specifications to minimize our spare parts inventory, streamline our maintenance program, and simplify driver training.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we operated a fleet of 3,660 tractors, including 3,564 company-owned tractors and 96 tractors supplied by independent contractors. The average age of our company-owned tractor fleet at December 31, 2022 was approximately 1.7 years. In 2022, we replaced our company-owned tractors within an average of 3.9 years after purchase.
 
Kenworth and Freightliner manufacture most of our company-owned tractors. Maintaining a relatively new and standardized fleet allows us to operate most miles while the tractors are under warranty to minimize repair and maintenance costs. It also enhances our ability to attract drivers, increases fuel economy, and improves customer acceptance by minimizing service interruptions caused by breakdowns. We adhere to a comprehensive maintenance program during the life of our equipment. We perform most routine servicing and repairs at our terminal facilities to reduce costly on-road repairs and out-of-route trips. We do not have any agreements with tractor manufacturers pursuant to which they agree to repurchase the tractors or guarantee a residual value, and we therefore could incur losses upon disposition if resale values of used tractors decline.
 
We historically have contracted with independent contractors to provide and operate a portion of our tractor fleet. Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. The percentage of our fleet provided by independent contractors was 2.6% at December 31, 2022, 2.9% at December 31, 2021 and 4.3% at December 31, 2020.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we operated a fleet of 5,753 trailers, consisting of 3,541 refrigerated trailers and 2,212 dry vans. Most of our refrigerated trailers are equipped with Thermo-King refrigeration units, air ride suspensions, and anti-lock brakes. The average age of our trailer fleet at December 31, 2022 was approximately 3.9 years. In 2022, we replaced our company-owned trailers within an average of 6.7 years after purchase.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we operated a fleet of 802 refrigerated containers for use on railroad flatcars as compared to a fleet of 634 refrigerated containers as of December 31, 2021.
 
Insurance and Claims
 
We self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as employees’ health insurance. We are responsible for our proportionate share of the legal expenses relating to such claims as well. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our insurance and claims reserves to reflect our experience. We have $16.1 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of the amounts for which we self-insure up to specified policy limits with licensed insurance carriers. Insurance carriers have significantly raised premiums for trucking companies, which increases our insurance and claims expense, along with other factors. We believe that our policy of self-insuring up to set limits, together with our safety and loss prevention programs, are effective means of managing insurance costs.

Fuel
 
Our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel. The price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control. Fuel prices fluctuated dramatically and quickly at various times during the last three years. We actively manage our fuel costs by purchasing fuel in bulk in Mondovi, Wisconsin and at a number of our other maintenance facilities throughout the country and have volume purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers that allow our drivers to purchase fuel at a discount while in transit. During 2022, nearly 100% of our fuel purchases were made at these designated locations. To help further reduce fuel consumption, we have equipped our company-owned tractors with auxiliary power units since 2007. These units reduce fuel consumption by providing quiet climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine. We have also invested in satellite tracking equipment for the temperature-control units on our trailers that has improved fuel usage through management of required temperature settings and run time of the units.
 
We further manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices through fuel surcharge programs with our customers and other measures that we have implemented. We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. These fuel surcharges, which adjust with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase, except for non-revenue miles, out-of-route miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. As of December 31, 2022, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
 
Competition
 
We are one of the leading carriers operating in the temperature-sensitive segment of the truckload market, and our dry freight services are expanding. These markets are highly competitive, and we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, and other transportation companies, many of which have more equipment, a wider range of services, and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages. We also compete with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors, and management employees. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business are service, freight rates, capacity, use of technology and financial stability, which positions us well to compete in these segments.
Regulation
 
The DOT and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and insurance requirements. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing, medical and continuous training qualification and hours-of-service.
 
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers. In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, system to measure and evaluate the on-road safety performance of commercial carriers and individual drivers. CSA’s Motor Carrier Safety Measurement System replaced the former SafeStat system and has removed a number of drivers from the industry as carriers are less willing to hire and retain drivers with marginal ratings, which has increased competition for qualified drivers.
 
The FMCSA issued final revisions to the hours-of-service requirements for drivers in September 2020. The revisions allow drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest breaks and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. Additionally, the new regulations increase by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather and expand the short haul exemption radius from 100 to 150 miles.

In January 2011, the FMCSA issued a regulatory proposal requiring commercial carriers to track compliance with hours-of-service regulations using electronic logging devices, or ELD’s, which was vacated and sent back to the FMCSA for further analysis and review in September 2011 by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21 Act, included a provision directing the FMCSA to develop a final ELD rule in 2013, which was delayed until its issuance in December 2015. The final rule required compliance beginning in December 2017 which was strictly enforced beginning in April 2018. Carriers using automatic on-board recording devices, or AOBRD’s, which were installed and in use prior to December 2017 were allowed until December 2019 to convert to ELD’s. Our entire fleet has been equipped with AOBRD’s since early 2011 and converted to ELD’s prior to December 2019.
 
The FMCSA has established a Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, which is a database of drivers who have violations including failed or refused drug and alcohol tests. Beginning in January 2020, all carriers are required to run queries in the clearinghouse for all prospective drivers and annually for all drivers currently employed. All testing violations must also be reported to the clearinghouse. Also effective in January 2020, all carriers must perform random drug tests at a rate of at least 50% of the average number of driver positions. The rate was at least 25% previously. We have been testing at a rate in excess of 50%, including when the requirement was at least 25%, and tested 55% in each of 2020 and 2021 and 57% in 2022. The impact of the clearinghouse has been significant, with a total of approximately 120,000 drivers removed from the trucking industry in 2020 through 2022.
 
In September 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services proposed mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs using hair follicles, which is a more strenuous test than current requirements.
 
We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. These regulations did not have a significant impact on our operations or financial results in 2020 through 2022.
