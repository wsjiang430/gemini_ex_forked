Potential Effects of new COVID-19 Variants on the Company’s Business
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit new variants could directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following:
 •Decreases in sales of our products in various distribution channels that are affected by COVID-19 variants. A resurgence of COVID-19 variants could cause reinstituted lockdowns and other restrictions, which could further impact customer demand. If COVID-19 variants and related unfavorable economic conditions continued to intensify, the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches, could be prolonged and may become more severe.
 •Deteriorating economic conditions and continued financial uncertainties in many of our major markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased and prolonged unemployment, decreases in per capita income and the level of disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing 


demand for our products. In addition, public concern among consumers regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 may also reduce demand for our products.
 •The closures of, and restrictions on, on-premise retailers and other establishments that sell our products as a result of new COVID-19 variants could adversely impact our sales and results of operations.
 •Our advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship and endorsement activities have been, and will continue to be, disrupted by reduced opportunities for such activities due to measures taken to limit the spread of new COVID-19 variants and cancellations of or reduced capacity at sporting events, concerts and other events could result in decreased demand for our products. Our product sampling programs, which are part of our strategy to develop brand awareness, have been, and could be, disrupted by new COVID-19 variants. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the changing landscape of advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship and endorsement opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic, our sales, market share, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.
 •Our innovation activities, including our ability to introduce new products in certain markets, have been delayed and/or adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If such innovation activities are disrupted delay the launch of new products and/or we are unable to secure sufficient distribution levels for such new products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 •Some of our suppliers, distributors and co-packers may experience plant closures, production slowdowns and disruptions in operations as a result of the impact of new COVID-19 variants. This could result in a disruption to our operations.
 •We may experience delays in receiving certain raw materials as a result of shipping delays due to, among other things, additional safety requirements imposed by port authorities, closures of, or congestion at ports, reduced availability of commercial transportation, border restrictions and capacity constraints.
 •Due to increased demand in at-home consumption, the beverage category has experienced some shortages of aluminum cans. However, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects on our business, operations and financial condition from such shortage, however we are unable to accurately predict how this might change in the future.
 •Governmental authorities at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and in certain foreign jurisdictions may increase or impose new income taxes, indirect taxes or other taxes or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations as a means of financing the costs of stimulus or may take other measures to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in direct and indirect tax rates could affect our net income and increases in consumer taxes could affect our products’ affordability and reduce our sales.
 •We may be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to goodwill or intangible assets whose fair values may be negatively affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or new COVID-19 variants in the future.
 •The continued financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause one or more of the financial institutions we do business with to fail or default in their obligations to us or to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, which could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
 •Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in negative publicity and the Company becoming a party to litigation claims and/or legal proceedings, which could consume significant financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for our products and injury to our reputation.
 
Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition.
 
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Company’s website as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Our website is www.celsiusholdingsinc.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report.
Our Products
 
We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. CELSIUS® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. CELSIUS® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. CELSIUS® is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda®, which makes our functional energy drinks low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of CELSIUS® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse.
 
CELSIUS® calorie-burning functional energy drinks were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005.
 
According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of CELSIUS® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise.
 

We currently have five functional energy drink lines:
 •CELSIUS® Originals and Vibe our initial product line, is currently offered in various flavors which are carbonated and non-carbonated.
 •CELSIUS HEAT, introduced in 2018 is a trainer’s grade functional energy drink. CELSIUS HEAT is also a dietary supplement that uses the same proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus® formula as CELSIUS®, Originals, which is proven to accelerate metabolism, boost energy and accelerate calorie and fat burn when combined with exercise. CELSIUS HEAT, which is packed with 2,000mg of L-citrulline and 300mg of caffeine, comes in eight carbonated flavors: Apple Jack’d, Orangesicle, Inferno Punch, Cherry Lime, Blueberry Pomegranate, Strawberry Dragonfruit, Tangerine Grapefruit and Jackfruit.
 •CELSIUS® BCCA+ENERGY, introduced in 2019, is an innovative branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) functional energy drink that fuels muscle recovery. The CELSIUS® BCCA+ENERGY product line was initially launched in the fitness channel.
 •CELSIUS® On-the-Go is a powdered form of the active ingredients in our functional energy drinks in individual On-The-Go packets as well as multiple serving canisters.
 •CELSIUS® Sweetened with Stevia is a natural line extension introduced in 2018, targeting the natural products channel. CELSIUS® Sweetened with Stevia is available in six refreshing flavors: three sparkling - grapefruit, cucumber lime, orange pomegranate and three non-carbonated - pineapple coconut, watermelon berry and strawberries & cream. This product line boasts a clean ingredient panel featuring 100% natural caffeine-from-green-coffee bean extract and Stevia an all-natural sweetener.
 
CELSIUS® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold in various packaging units are designed to provide a clean, crisp and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to-drink product line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free.
 
Func Food Group Oyj, a company incorporated under the laws of Finland ("Func Food") was acquired in October 2019, as a result we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food.
 
Clinical Studies
 
It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more "alternative" beverages are marketed with health claims. CELSIUS® was one of the first functional energy drinks to be launched along with a clinical study. CELSIUS® is also one of very few functional energy drinks that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some functional energy drink and supplement companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important over time, to have studies on the actual product.
 
We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for CELSIUS®. Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total CELSIUS® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided CELSIUS® functional energy drinks for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal stockholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies.
 
The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of CELSIUS® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12-ounce serving of CELSIUS® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke®. All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank CELSIUS® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis.
 
Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy.
 
The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of CELSIUS® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming CELSIUS® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo drink and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant.
 

The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the CELSIUS® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis.
 
The fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined CELSIUS® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of CELSIUS® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion.
 
The fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS®, per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels.
 
The sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS®, per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO2 were observed in the subjects that consumed CELSIUS® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects.
 
Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as its ready to drink products.
 
Manufacture and Supply of Our Products
 
Our functional energy drinks and supplements are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. Utilizing co-packers allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of CELSIUS® products is specified as 15 to 18 months.
 
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in CELSIUS® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. For certain ingredients, there are limited suppliers. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers, which may disrupt our production schedules.
 
Packaging materials are available from multiple sources in the United States. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages.
 
We believe that our co-packing arrangements and supply sources are adequate for our present needs.
 
Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries.
 
Distribution
 
Domestic
 
In the United States and elsewhere in North America, CELSIUS® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites.



We distribute our products domestically through direct-store delivery (DSD), distributors as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR).
 
Our products are also sold online through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart.com.
 
Pepsi. Distribution Agreement
 
On August 1, 2022, we entered into the Distribution Agreement relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (the “Territory”). Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. The Distribution Agreement represents a master service agreement and can be cancelled by either party in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement without cause in the nineteenth year of the term (i.e., 2041), the twenty-ninth year of the term (i.e., 2051) and each ten (10) year period thereafter (i.e., 2061, 2071, etc.) by providing twelve (12) months’ written notice on August 1st of each such year to the other party. Except for a termination by the Company “with cause” or a termination by Pepsi “without cause”, the Company is required to pay Pepsi certain compensation upon a termination as specified in the Distribution Agreement.
 
The Company agreed to provide Pepsi a right of first offer in the event the Company intends to (i) manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries as specified in the Distribution Agreement or (ii) distribute or sell products in any future channels and distribution methods during the term of the Distribution Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company and Pepsi agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute with Pepsi a distribution agreement reasonably consistent with the Distribution Agreement for the sale and distribution of the products in Canada, and Pepsi agreed to meet and confer in good faith with the Company regarding the terms and conditions upon which Pepsi may be willing to sell or distribute products, either directly or through local sub-distributors in certain other additional countries. The Distribution Agreement includes other customary provisions, including non-competition covenants in favor of the Company, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, insurance provisions and confidentiality provisions.
 
In connection with the Distribution Agreement the Company and Pepsi also executed a Channel Transition Agreement, providing for the Company’s transition of certain existing distribution rights in the Territory to Pepsi.
 
International

We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands.
 
We market our products in the Asian market through local distributors in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Qifeng”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the CELSIUS® brand in 2018 through our partnership with Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our CELSIUS® products and a repayment of an investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize CELSIUS® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of approximately $6.9 million for the first five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter and until the licensing agreement is terminated or canceled. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng will repay the marketing investments made by CELSIUS® into the China market through 2018. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated.
 
With our new partnership with Pepsi, we would expect to utilize the Pepsi system as we develop international expansion plans in future periods.

Sales and Marketing
 
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, by making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are refreshed from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we continue to reevaluate from time to time.
 
Where appropriate, we partner with our distributors, or retailers to assist our marketing efforts.
 
Seasonality of Sales
 
As is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, sales of products are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets, albeit with our recent significant growth, we have seen ongoing quarter over quarter growth regardless of the season.
Competition
 
We believe that our CELSIUS® brand products are one of the few functional energy drink and supplement lines whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position. However, our products do compete broadly with not only functional energy drinks and supplements, but all categories of liquid refreshments. The functional energy drink, supplement and liquid refreshment markets are highly competitive, and include international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional energy drink and supplement markets include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull.
Proprietary Rights
 
We have registered the CELSIUS® and MetaPlus® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks.
 
We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus® formulation and product formulas.
 
We maintain our MetaPlus® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula.
 
We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future.
 
Government Regulation
 
The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.
 
The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold.
 

Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
The facilities of our co-packers in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, the use of water resources and recycling. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance mandates, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance and future growth. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
Container Deposits
 
Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. We are required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
 
Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employs 378 people including its executive officers, in five different countries. This includes 324 employees in the US, 49 in countries within Europe, and 5 in Hong Kong.
Employees
 
We believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talents. Through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus on health and well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives.
 
We believe we have a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and work to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all team members.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
We believe a culture that celebrates diverse talent, individual identity, and different points of view, empowers employees to contribute new ideas that support our continued and growing success. Women, racial and ethnic minorities collectively constitute a meaningful part of our overall workforce across all levels of our global organization.
Culture and Engagement
 
We believe open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow, and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with our senior leadership.
Leadership, Training and Development
 
We focus on investing in inspirational leadership, learning opportunities and capabilities to equip our global workforce with the skills they need while improving engagement and retention. We provide formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to help our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their careers. We offer a variety of programs that contribute to our leadership, training and development goals, and comprehensive coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee development.
Compensation and Benefits
 
We believe that compensation should be competitive and equitable and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invest in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.
 
Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong connection between the contributions of our employees and their pay. We conduct annual pay equity analyses to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential issues or disparities and we adjust base pay, where appropriate. Also, as permitted by local law, annually, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives, and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness. We provide compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent while maintaining alignment with the market. We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees.
 
Our base pay aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and geographic location. Additionally, we provide competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages may include: employee assistance programs, medical and dental insurance, vision insurance, well-being rewards programs, core and supplemental life insurance, long and short-term disability, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, retirement savings plans, prepaid legal services, healthy rewards programs, identity theft assistance, financial courses and advisors, vacation pay, holiday pay, annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for eligible employees.
 

Our Compensation Committee provides oversight of the our policies and strategies relating to talent, leadership, and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The Compensation Committee also evaluates and approves our compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives. In addition, the Compensation Committee oversees succession planning and talent development for our senior executives.
 
We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made us a desirable destination for employees.
