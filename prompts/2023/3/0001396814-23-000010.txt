Overview
We are the industry leader in our commitment to non-opioid pain management and providing a non-opioid option to as many patients as possible to redefine the role of opioids as a rescue therapy only. We are also developing innovative interventions to address debilitating conditions involving the sympathetic nervous system, such as cardiac electrical storm, chronic pain and spasticity. We are advancing a pipeline of unique, safe, best-in-class products across a variety of therapeutic areas that include acute postsurgical pain; acute and chronic osteoarthritis, or OA, pain, spasticity and stellate ganglion block. We have three commercialized non-opioid treatments: EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), a long-acting, local analgesic currently approved for postsurgical pain management; ZILRETTA® (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension), an extended-release, intra-articular, or IA (meaning in the joint), corticosteroid injection indicated for the management of OA knee pain; and iovera°®, a novel, handheld device for delivering immediate, long-acting, drug-free pain control using precise, controlled doses of cold temperature to a targeted nerve.
Strategy
To achieve our goal of global leadership in non-opioid pain management and regenerative health solutions, we are advancing a three-pronged strategy: 
•Expanding the use of our opioid-free commercial assets. The COVID pandemic and opioid crises have intensified the need for opioid alternatives. In the U.S., EXPAREL is the only opioid-free, long-acting local and regional analgesic approved for infiltration, field blocks and interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce local or regional postsurgical analgesia. EXPAREL is also approved for infiltration in pediatric patients aged six years and older in the U.S. In Europe, EXPAREL is approved as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults and children aged six years and older. Anesthesia-driven postsurgical pain management with long-acting field and nerve blocks utilizing EXPAREL are enabling the migration of complex, painful surgeries to outpatient sites of care. ZILRETTA is the first and only extended-release, intra-articular therapy that can provide major relief for OA knee pain for three months and has the potential to become an alternative to hyaluronic acid, or HA, and platelet rich plasma, or PRP, injections or other early intervention treatments. With the iovera° system,

healthcare providers can replace narcotics and radiofrequency ablation with an innovative drug-free nerve block. We believe the iovera° system is also highly complementary to ZILRETTA. In addition to our current commercial opportunities, we are advancing label expansion activities. For EXPAREL, we recently submitted an sNDA seeking expansion of our label to include sciatic nerve blocks in the popliteal fossa, as well as femoral nerve blocks in the adductor canal, with an anticipated FDA action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, in the second half of 2023. We are also advancing a clinical development program for EXPAREL in patients under six years of age. For ZILRETTA, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in shoulder OA and a Phase 4 study in Type 2 diabetes. For iovera°, we are developing new iovera° Smart Tips for chronic lower back pain and spine procedures. We also plan to initiate a registration study of iovera° as a treatment for spasticity.
•Advancing our clinical-stage pipeline within multiple areas of unmet need. We have completed a Phase 1 study of PCRX-201, a novel, IA gene therapy product candidate that produces the anti-inflammatory protein interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) treating OA pain in the knee. Based upon compelling initial Phase 1 efficacy and safety data for PCRX-201, we are working with investigators and plan to request an FDA meeting to discuss the regulatory pathway forward for OA of the knee, as well as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation. We are also advancing our pipeline of clinical-stage assets that utilize our proprietary multivesicular liposome (pMVL) technology. The pMVL carrier matrix consists of microscopic, spherical, lipid-based particles composed of a honeycomb of numerous, non-concentric, internal aqueous chambers containing the encapsulated active agent. Each chamber is separated from adjacent chambers by lipid membranes. Following injection, the pMVL particles release the active agent over an extended period as the lipid membranes erode or reorganize. We are preparing to launch a Phase 1 study of Dexamethosone-pMVL for low back pain (“PCRX-401”), a Phase 1 study of high-dose bupivacaine-pMVL for five or more days of pain relief (“PCRX-501”), and a Phase 1 study of EXPAREL for intrathecal analgesia.
•Accessing complementary innovative assets using a combination of strategic investment, in-licensing, or acquisition. We believe EXPAREL, ZILRETTA, iovera° and our pMVL drug delivery technology offer a strong foundation to address the opioid epidemic. Building on these proprietary assets, we have also made investments in the musculoskeletal and chronic pain spaces. We plan to continue to advance these two key areas with a focus on the knee and spine continuums of care and chronic pain. We are using a combination of strategic investments to support promising early-stage platforms, as well as in-licensing or acquisition transactions to build-out a pipeline of innovation to improve patients’ journeys along the neural pain pathway.
The Opioid Epidemic
Opioid addiction in the U.S. has reached epidemic proportions, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, reporting that over 107,000 Americans died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022—a 44 percent jump from the statistics reported two years earlier. Opioids were involved in more than two-thirds of all drug overdose deaths reported, with synthetic opioids being the primary driver of the increase in fatalities.
In 2018, new research showed that patients received nearly 100 to 200 opioid pills to help manage pain from four common procedures ranging from rotator cuff repair and hip replacement to knee replacement and sleeve gastrectomy. Further, one-quarter of orthopedic surgery patients were prescribed a daily dose of opioids equal to 90 milligrams of morphine or more, which are doses so potent that the CDC says they put patients at high risk for overdose. A 2017 report shows that across the seven orthopedic and soft tissue surgical procedures examined, patients were prescribed an average of 82 opioid pills each to help manage postsurgical pain. The research also indicates that close to nine percent of surgical patients became newly persistent users in 2017, continuing to take these opioids at least three to six months after their procedure. Among patients having knee replacement surgery or a colectomy, newly persistent opioid users climbed as high as 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Further, women were 40 percent more likely to become persistent opioid users than men; and among persistent users, females were prescribed 15 percent more opioids than their male counterparts. These findings come from the report, United States for Non-Dependence: An Analysis of the Impact of Opioid Overprescribing in America, based on an analysis of 2016 adjudicated medical and pharmacy claims data conducted by QuintilesIMS.
LPGA Sponsorship
In February 2023, we announced a multi-year sponsorship with the Ladies Professional Golf Association, or LPGA, to make iovera° the official non-opioid pain management partner of the LPGA. The sponsorship will aim to draw attention to the role non-opioid pain management options can play in curbing the U.S. opioid epidemic. We will host initiatives at various LPGA tournaments to drive awareness and education on the availability of non-opioid interventions as well as encourage fans to wear purple each September, which is recognized as Opioid Awareness Month.

Our Commercial Products
EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension)
EXPAREL was approved by the FDA in October 2011 and was commercially launched in the U.S. in April 2012. In the U.S., EXPAREL is currently indicated in patients six years of age and older for single-dose infiltration to produce postsurgical local analgesia, and in adults as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve blocks. In November 2020, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for EXPAREL as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults and children aged six years and older. We launched EXPAREL in the United Kingdom, or U.K., and select European Union, or E.U., countries in November 2021. Since its initial approval in 2011, more than 12 million patients have been treated with EXPAREL.
EXPAREL consists of bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, encapsulated in our pMVL drug delivery technology, which delivers bupivacaine over time for extended analgesia. We believe that EXPAREL addresses a significant medical need for a safe and effective long-acting non-opioid postsurgical analgesic and plays a significant role in opioid minimization strategies. EXPAREL is designed for recovery with minimal opioid use by (i) delivering targeted local analgesia at the surgical site; (ii) reliably releasing bupivacaine over time for prolonged analgesia; (iii) eliminating the need for catheters and pumps that may hinder recovery and (iv) providing long-lasting pain control while reducing the need for opioids.
Our net product sales of EXPAREL in 2022 were $536.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, net product sales of EXPAREL accounted for 81%, 94% and 96% of our total revenues, respectively. The significant change in the 2022 percentage resulted from the recognition of a full year of ZILRETTA net product sales after completing the Flexion Acquisition in November 2021.
ZILRETTA (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension)
ZILRETTA was approved by the FDA in October 2017 and launched in the U.S. shortly thereafter. ZILRETTA is the first and only extended-release, intra-articular therapy for patients with OA knee pain. ZILRETTA uses a proprietary extended-release microsphere technology to slowly and continuously releases triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, a commonly administered, immediate-release corticosteroid into the knee for approximately three months to provide significant pain relief for 12 weeks, with some people experiencing pain relief through 16 weeks.
We added ZILRETTA to our commercial offering with the completion of the Flexion Acquisition in November 2021. ZILRETTA net product sales were $105.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2021, we recognized ZILRETTA net product sales of $12.7 million during the post-closing period of the Flexion Acquisition of November 19, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
The iovera° system
The iovera° system is an FDA-approved, non-opioid handheld cryoanalgesia device used to produce precise, controlled doses of cold temperature to targeted nerves. It has been FDA 510(k) cleared in the U.S., has a CE mark in the E.U. and is cleared for marketing in Canada for the blocking of pain. The iovera° system is highly complementary to EXPAREL and ZILRETTA as a non-opioid therapy that alleviates pain using a non-pharmacological nerve block to disrupt pain signals being transmitted to the brain from the site of injury or surgery. It is also indicated for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with arthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our net product sales of iovera° were $15.3 million, $16.2 million and $8.8 million, respectively.
EXPAREL Clinical Benefits
We believe EXPAREL can replace the use of bupivacaine delivered via elastomeric pumps as the foundation of a multimodal regimen for long-acting postsurgical pain management. Based on our clinical data, EXPAREL:
•provides long-lasting local or regional analgesia;
•is a ready-to-use formulation;
•expands easily with saline or lactated Ringer’s solution to reach a desired volume;
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 8


Table of Contents

•leverages existing interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, field block and infiltration administration techniques; and
•facilitates treatment of a variety of surgical sites.
We believe EXPAREL is a key component of long-acting postsurgical pain management regimens that reduce the need for opioids. Based on the clinical data from our Phase 3 and Phase 4 clinical studies as well as data from retrospective health outcomes studies, EXPAREL significantly reduces opioid usage while improving postsurgical pain management.
In our Phase 3 hemorrhoidectomy trial, EXPAREL:
•delayed the median time to rescue analgesic use (opioids) to 15 hours for patients treated with EXPAREL versus one hour for patients treated with placebo;
•significantly increased the percentage of patients requiring no opioid rescue medication through 72 hours post-surgery to 28%, compared to 10% for placebo;
•resulted in 45% less opioid usage through 72 hours post-surgery compared to placebo; and
•increased the percentage of patients who were pain free at 24 hours post-surgery compared to placebo.
In our Phase 3 trial as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block for upper extremity surgeries, EXPAREL:
•decreased total opioid consumption by 78% (p<0.0001) from zero to 48 hours after surgery;
•reduced pain scores by 46% versus placebo (p<0.0001); and
•allowed 13% of patients who received EXPAREL to remain opioid-free for 48 hours after surgery (p<0.01) compared to one opioid-free patient in the placebo arm.
In our Phase 3 trial as a femoral nerve block in the adductor canal in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, EXPAREL:
•achieved the primary endpoint by significantly reducing cumulative pain scores from zero to 96 hours after surgery compared with bupivacaine HCl (p<0.01); and
•achieved its secondary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in postsurgical opioid consumption through 96 hours (p<0.01) compared with bupivacaine HCl.
In our Phase 3 trial as a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa in patients undergoing bunionectomy, EXPAREL:
•achieved the primary endpoint by significantly reducing cumulative pain scores from zero to 96 hours after surgery compared with bupivacaine HCl (p<0.00001); and
•achieved its secondary endpoints with statistically significant reductions in postsurgical opioid consumption through 96 hours (p<0.00001) and the percentage of opioid-free subjects (p<0.001) compared with bupivacaine HCl.
EXPAREL can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes. We believe EXPAREL:
•provides effective pain control without the need for expensive and difficult-to-use delivery technologies that extend the duration of action for bupivacaine, such as elastomeric pumps, or opioids administered through patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, when used as part of a multimodal postsurgical pain regimen;
•reduces the need for patients to be constrained by elastomeric pumps and PCA systems, which are barriers to earlier ambulation and may introduce catheter-related issues, including infection; and
•promotes maintenance of early postsurgical pain management, which may reduce the time spent in the intensive care unit.
Key EXPAREL Markets
EXPAREL-based enhanced recovery after surgery, or ERAS, protocols are becoming a cornerstone of opioid-sparing postsurgical pain management and enabling the shifting of many complex, painful orthopedic procedures to the 23-hour stay environment.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 9


Table of Contents

Orthopedics
EXPAREL is used across multiple orthopedic procedures, including joint reconstruction, shoulder, spine, extremity procedures, and hip fractures.
Total joint arthroplasties are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years with a significant migration of these procedures from the inpatient hospital setting to outpatient sites of care. EXPAREL-based regional analgesia as part of multimodal pain management protocols in enhanced ERAS pathways is supporting this surgical migration. The clinical and economic benefits of EXPAREL in total joint arthroplasty procedures have been demonstrated in clinical studies with EXPAREL use associated with significant reductions in opioid consumption, well-controlled pain management, shorter recovery time, same-day discharge to home and high patient satisfaction.
EXPAREL is being adopted in an increasing number of spine surgeries as a key component of a multimodal pain management solution enabling rapid recovery after surgery and a reduced reliance on opioids, which have been the mainstay in postsurgical pain control in the spine area for decades. Two important patient groups are driving the spine market: first, pediatric cases, like adolescent scoliosis patients, who are undergoing highly invasive surgeries and who until very recently only had opioids available to treat their pain, and second, adult degenerative patients who are often coming into surgery opioid-tolerant and who may have already had multiple back surgeries. Managing postsurgical pain in these adult degenerative patients can be challenging due to their established opioid tolerance, but by utilizing EXPAREL, healthcare providers can control their pain with a non-opioid approach, and when feasible based on surgical intervention and patient characteristics, move many historical inpatient procedures to the 23-hour stay environment. 
EXPAREL administered as a brachial plexus nerve block is a key and growing part of our business. An EXPAREL brachial plexus block provides pain coverage for the upper quadrant for use in rotator cuff, shoulder arthroplasty, elbow, wrist, and hand procedures. Like other regional field blocks, our anesthesiologist customers see the strong advantages of using brachial plexus blocks as a vehicle for shifting procedures to the outpatient setting by replacing antiquated pumps and catheters, which often become dislodged and prevent a procedure from taking place in a 23-hour site of care. Additionally, EXPAREL reimbursement is consistently improving as payers and self-insured employers continue to drive the shift from inpatient to outpatient care for a variety of surgeries.
Abdominal and Colorectal
A variety of truncal blocks have emerged for use in abdominal and colorectal procedures. Transversus abdominis plane, or TAP, and erector spinae plane blocks represent a significant market where EXPAREL is providing long-acting pain control for abdominal and spinal surgeries and supporting the migration of these procedures to the 23-hour setting. We expect the expanding use of EXPAREL field blocks as the foundation of enhanced recovery protocols across various abdominal and colorectal procedures to continue to be a significant growth driver.
Women’s Health
There is a significant and growing demand among women for managing pain with non-opioid options. Opioid addiction in women is growing at an alarming rate and studies have shown that women are 40 percent more likely than men to become newly persistent users of opioids following surgery. Women’s Health continues to be an important source of growth as anesthesia-driven EXPAREL-based TAP and pectoralis blocks take hold as institutional protocol for Cesarean section, abdominoplasty, gynecologic oncology, mastectomy and breast reconstruction procedures.
Cardiothoracic 
Cardiothoracic surgery is considered one of the most painful types of surgical procedures for both open and minimally invasive procedures. As a result, opioids are widely used, but are often inadequate. Poorly controlled postoperative pain leads to the development of chronic persistent pain in as many as 40 percent of these patients and persistent opioid use after surgery is seen in over 10 percent of such patients. Regional anesthesia approaches have been evolving, with EXPAREL replacing thoracic epidurals as an alternative method of producing long-lasting postsurgical analgesia.

Pediatrics
In March 2021, the FDA approved our sNDA to expand the EXPAREL label to include use in patients six years of age and older for single-dose infiltration to produce postsurgical local analgesia. EXPAREL is the first and only FDA-approved long-acting local analgesic for the pediatric population as young as age six. In November 2022, both the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, approved marketing authorization for an expanded indication of EXPAREL to include use in children aged six years and older as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds.
Opioids, short-acting local anesthetics and catheter-based devices have been the historical mainstay in pediatric postsurgical pain management despite safety implications and limited studies in children. The risks and complications of adult-based pain management approaches may be magnified in children with 50 percent of children reporting moderate to severe pain in the hospital after surgery and 20 percent of children reporting chronic pain 12 months after surgery.
EXPAREL is redefining the paradigm of care for postsurgical pain management in children as the market’s only clinically proven safe alternative for long-acting, non-opioid postsurgical pain control in children aged 6 and over. There are approximately one million pediatric procedures per year in the U.S. We are working with prominent thought leaders who are providing a rapid transfer of best-practice for establishing EXPAREL-based protocols as the new standard of care. 
Third Molar (Wisdom Tooth) Procedures
Third molar (wisdom tooth) extractions are among the most common dental procedures in the U.S. and are performed in up to 5 million patients every year. Oral surgery, including third molar extraction, is associated with a defined period of pain and discomfort that traditionally leads to prescriptions for opioids. A large retrospective review of the Medicaid database found that of 2.8 million patients who underwent surgical tooth extraction, 1.2 million—or roughly 42 percent—filled a prescription for opioids within seven days after surgery, with a median of 120 morphine milligram equivalents dispensed per patient. A study of the effect of EXPAREL on postoperative opioid prescribing after third molar extraction showed that patients who received EXPAREL were prescribed significantly fewer opioids, including refills, compared to those who did not receive EXPAREL. The study, A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study of the Effect of Liposomal Bupivacaine on Postoperative Opioid Prescribing After Third Molar Extraction, was published in The Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in July 2021. In this retrospective analysis, researchers reviewed data from 600 patients who underwent third molar extractions between 2012 and 2018. De-identified data from 300 patients who received EXPAREL were compared to data from 300 patients who did not receive an infiltration of EXPAREL. Data from two outpatient oral surgery centers were included in this analysis. Patients in the EXPAREL treatment group received:
•59 percent fewer opioids, including refills, compared to patients in the non-EXPAREL group (p<0.0001)
•Fewer additional opioid prescriptions compared to the non-EXPAREL group (3.3% of patients required a refill vs. 7.7% of patients, respectively)
In September 2017, we announced a collaboration with Aetna, one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits companies, with the support of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS). This national program aims to reduce the number of opioid tablets dispensed to patients undergoing impacted third molar extractions by at least 50 percent through the utilization of EXPAREL to provide prolonged non-opioid postsurgical pain control. Aetna now includes the cost of EXPAREL as a covered expense for impacted third molar extractions performed by surgeons who have completed training on use of the product.
In September 2022, we announced a joint initiative with Sevāredent Sourcing Solutions, or Sevāredent, a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) that creates a competitive advantage for like-minded dental organizations through vendor partnerships that drive supply chain value and efficiencies, to provide expanded access to EXPAREL for patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial (OMFS) procedures ranging from third molar and full mouth extractions to dentures and implants. This collaboration, which advances Sevāredent’s goal of improving patient outcomes and reducing exposure to opioids and their associated risks, provides easy access to EXPAREL—including comprehensive product training and onboarding support from Pacira—for more than 1,800 dental offices across the U.S.
ZILRETTA Clinical Benefits
ZILRETTA combines a commonly administered steroid, TA, with a proprietary, extended-release microsphere technology to administer extended therapeutic concentrations in the joint and persistent analgesic effect.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 11


Table of Contents

Based on the strength of its pivotal and other clinical trials, we believe that ZILRETTA represents an important treatment option for the millions of patients in the U.S. in need of safe and effective extended relief from OA knee pain. The pivotal Phase 3 trial, on which the approval of ZILRETTA was based, showed that ZILRETTA significantly reduced OA knee pain for 12 weeks, with some people experiencing pain relief through 16 weeks. Both the magnitude and duration of pain relief provided by ZILRETTA in clinical trials were clinically meaningful with the magnitude of pain relief amongst the largest seen to date in OA clinical trials. The overall frequency of treatment-related adverse events in these trials was similar to those observed with placebo, and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. We believe that ZILRETTA holds the potential to become the corticosteroid of choice given its safety and efficacy profile, and the fact that it is the first and only extended-release corticosteroid on the market. In September 2021, the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, or AAOS, updated its evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, finding ZILRETTA can improve patient outcomes over traditional immediate-release corticosteroids.
iovera° Clinical Benefits
There is a growing body of clinical data demonstrating success with iovera° treatment for OA of the knee. Surgical intervention is typically a last resort for patients suffering from OA of the knee. In one study, the majority of the patients suffering from OA of the knee experienced pain relief up to 150 days after being treated with iovera°.
Preliminary findings demonstrated reductions in opioids, including:
•The daily morphine equivalent consumption in the per protocol group analysis was significantly lower at 72 hours (p<0.05), 6 weeks (p<0.05) and 12 weeks (p<0.05).
•Patients who were administered iovera° were far less likely to take opioids six weeks after surgery. The number of patients taking opioids six weeks after TKA in the control group was three times the number of patients taking opioids in the cryoanalgesia group (14 percent vs. 44 percent, p<0.01).
•Patients in the iovera° group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain scores from their baseline pain scores at 72 hours (p<0.05) and at 12 weeks (p<0.05).
We believe these data validate iovera° as a clinically meaningful non-opioid alternative for patients undergoing TKA, and that iovera° offers the opportunity to provide patients with non-opioid pain control well in advance of any necessary surgical intervention through a number of key product attributes:
•iovera° is safe and effective with immediate pain relief that can last for months as the nerve regenerates over time;
•iovera° is repeatable;
•The iovera° technology does not risk damage to the surrounding tissue;
•iovera° is a convenient handheld device with a single-use procedure-specific Smart Tip; and
•iovera° can be delivered precisely using ultrasound guidance or an anatomical landmark.
In September 2021, the AAOS updated its evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, reporting that denervation therapy—including cryoneurolysis—may reduce knee pain and improve function in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee.
The Osteoarthritis Market
OA is the most common form of arthritis. It is also called degenerative joint disease and occurs most frequently in the hands, hips and knees. With OA, the cartilage within a joint begins to break down and the underlying bone begins to change. These changes usually develop slowly and worsen over time. OA can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. In some cases it also causes reduced function and disability—some people are no longer able to do daily tasks or work. According to the CDC, OA affects over 32.5 million adults in the U.S.
The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee OA is 45 percent according to the Arthritis Foundation. The prevalence of symptomatic knee OA increases with each decade of life, with the annual incidence of knee OA being highest between age 55 and 64 years old. There are 14 million individuals in the U.S. who have symptomatic knee OA, and nearly two million are under the age of 45. Surgical intervention is typically a last resort for patients suffering from OA of the knee.
With the addition of ZILRETTA to our product offering, we can now offer clinicians the flexibility to individualize OA knee pain treatment with either ZILRETTA or a drug-free nerve block with iovera° based on patient factors and preference, physician training, site of care and reimbursement considerations.

Label and Global Expansion Activities
EXPAREL
•Lower extremity nerve block. In September 2022, we announced positive topline results from two Phase 3 registration studies of EXPAREL as a single-dose nerve block for postsurgical regional analgesia in lower extremity surgeries. The first study, which evaluated EXPAREL as a femoral nerve block in the adductor canal in patients undergoing TKA achieved the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative pain scores from 0 to 96 hours compared with bupivacaine HCl (p<0.01). EXPAREL also achieved a statistically significant reduction in postsurgical opioid consumption through 96 hours (p<0.01) compared with bupivacaine HCl, a key secondary endpoint. The second study, which evaluated EXPAREL as a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa in patients undergoing bunionectomy, achieved the primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative pain scores from 0 to 96 hours compared with bupivacaine HCl (p<0.00001). EXPAREL also achieved statistically significant reductions in postsurgical opioid consumption (p<0.00001) and percentage of opioid-free subjects (p<0.001) through 96 hours compared with bupivacaine HCl, which were key secondary endpoints. EXPAREL was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with bupivacaine HCl. With these positive results, we submitted an sNDA to the FDA in January 2023 seeking expansion of the EXPAREL label to include femoral nerve block in the adductor canal and sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa, with an anticipated FDA action date under PDUFA in the second half of 2023.
•Pediatrics. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study after which we would initiate a registration study to support expansion of the EXPAREL single-dose infiltration label to include patients under six years of age. If successful, we expect this study will support expansion of the EXPAREL labels in the U.S. and E.U. We are also discussing our regulatory strategy for EXPAREL administered as a nerve block in the pediatric setting.
•Stellate ganglion block. Planning is underway for a multicenter registration study of EXPAREL as a stellate ganglion block for treating refractory cardiac ventricular dysrhythmias and for use to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery. We are working with a steering committee of Key Opinion Leaders, or KOLs, in regional anesthesia and stellate ganglion blocks to help finalize study design. After we meet with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy for expanding the EXPAREL label to include stellate ganglion block, we expect to proceed with a registration trial. We believe a stellate ganglion block utilizing EXPAREL will last for several days and address a significant unmet need in patients with ventricular and atrial dysrhythmias.
•Global expansion. We have prioritized the European and Latin American markets for global expansion. In Europe, EXPAREL is approved as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults, and in November 2022, we received approval to include children aged 6 years or older as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. We launched EXPAREL in the U.K. and targeted E.U. countries in the fourth quarter of 2021. In Latin America, we have a distribution agreement with Eurofarma Laboratories S.A., or Eurofarma, for the development and commercialization of EXPAREL. Eurofarma has the exclusive right to market and distribute EXPAREL in 19 countries in Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. In addition, Eurofarma will be responsible for regulatory filings for EXPAREL in these countries, and recently submitted an application seeking approval in Brazil. We will receive royalties and are also eligible to receive regulatory- and commercial-based milestone payments that are triggered by the achievement of certain events.
ZILRETTA 
We believe ZILRETTA’s extended-release profile may also provide effective treatment for OA pain of the shoulder, and we intend to initiate a Phase 3 trial investigating ZILRETTA in shoulder OA in 2023. In addition, we are planning a Phase 4 study in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The shoulder study and the diabetes study will both compare ZILRETTA to immediate release TA.
iovera°
In 2022, we launched a next-generation iovera° handheld device, which we believe is more efficient, easier to use and more durable. We are also developing new iovera° Smart Tips for certain procedures and are developing a specific tip for a medial branch block for treating chronic low-back pain, as well as spine procedures. We are also seeking a label expansion for the

treatment of spasticity, which we believe is a significant long-term opportunity for iovera°. Additionally, we began selling iovera° in the E.U. through a contracted sales force in 2022.
Clinical Development Programs
PCRX-201
PCRX-201 was added to our portfolio as part of the Flexion Acquisition. PCRX-201 is a novel, IA gene therapy product candidate that produces the anti-inflammatory protein, IL-1Ra, for treating OA pain in the knee. Based upon compelling initial Phase 1 efficacy and safety data for PCRX-201, we are working with investigators and plan to request an FDA meeting to discuss the regulatory pathway forward for OA of the knee, as well as an RMAT designation.
pMVL-Based Clinical Programs
Given the proven safety, flexibility and customizability of our pMVL drug delivery technology platform for acute, sub-acute and chronic pain applications, we have several pMVL-based products in clinical development. Following data readouts from preclinical and feasibility studies for these candidates, we have prioritized three programs for clinical development: (i) PCRX-401, a dexamethasone-pMVL for low back pain; (ii) PCRX-501, a high potency bupivacaine-pMVL for longer-lasting pain relief (20.0 mg/mL) and (iii) EXPAREL for intrathecal analgesia (13.3 mg/mL). We are planning to initiate the second half of our Phase 1 study of EXPAREL for intrathecal analgesia in the first half of 2023.
PCRX-301
PCRX-301 is a locally administered NaV1.7 inhibitor, known as funapide, formulated for extended release in a thermosensitive hydrogel. The initial development of PCRX-301 was intended to support administration as a peripheral analgesic lower extremity nerve block for management of post-operative pain. In September 2022, based on the results of a completed phase 1 study, we decided to discontinue further development of PCRX-301 due to a lack of clinical efficacy when compared to placebo and issues with the hydrogel formulation.
External Innovation
In parallel to our internal clinical programs, our business development team is pursuing innovative acquisition targets that are complementary to EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera° and are of great interest to the surgical and anesthesia audiences we are already calling on today. We are using a combination of strategic investments, in-licensing and acquisition transactions to buildout a pipeline of innovation to improve patients’ journeys along the neural pain pathway. The strategic investments we have made to support promising early stage platforms are summarized below:

Company | Development Stage | Description of Platform Technology | Potential Therapeutic Areas 
CarthroniX, Inc. | Phase 1-Ready | CX-011, a small molecule modulator of gp130 formulated as an intra-articular injection designed to slow joint degeneration by mediating IL-6 cytokines | Knee OA 
Genascence Corporation | Phase 1b-Ready | Adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy engineered to deliver Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1Ra) to target cells in joint(s) | Knee OA

•collaborating with healthcare providers towards improving the knowledge and management of pain in surgical and OA patients with a focus on opioid risk and non-opioid alternatives and engaging our field-based medical teams in system-wide partnerships to address the national opioid epidemic, with a goal of studying alternative postsurgical pain management options that focus on optimization and opioid alternative strategies; and
•facilitating reimbursement and the shift of procedures to hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgical center, or ASC, sites of care.
Pacira Training Facilities
We maintain and operate two training facilities—one in Tampa, Florida and one in Houston, Texas. These sites were constructed with a singular goal in mind: to advance education on best practice techniques to effectively manage acute pain while reducing or eliminating the need for opioids. These facilities provide clinicians with flexible, state-of-the-art environments for interactive, hands-on instruction on the latest and most innovative local, regional and field block approaches for managing pain, improving patient care and enabling patient migration to the 23-hour stay environment.
Tampa, Florida
In October 2020, we opened the Pacira Innovation and Training, or PIT, Center of Tampa. We designed this facility to help advance clinician understanding of the latest local, regional and field block approaches for managing pain. The PIT of Tampa provides an unparalleled training environment for healthcare providers working to reduce or eliminate patient exposure to opioids. The PIT of Tampa supports a full range of educational events to advance clinician understanding of the latest local, regional, and field block approaches for managing pain and reducing or eliminating exposure to opioids. Our principal executive offices and corporate headquarters are also located at the PIT of Tampa.
The PIT of Tampa consists of approximately 13,000 square-feet of fully adaptable space and is equipped with state-of-the-art technology and audio/visual capabilities and features several distinct training spaces including a simulation lab equipped with seven ultrasound scanning stations; a lecture hall featuring a 4½-foot tall by 24-foot wide liquid crystal display video wall to support live, virtual and even global presentations; and a green-screen broadcast studio designed to livestream content with single or multiple hosts.
In addition to our EXPAREL programs, we are hosting ongoing workshops to train new users on best practice techniques for iovera° administration at the PIT of Tampa. Led by healthcare professionals, these labs include didactic lectures and hands-on trainings including live model nerve scanning and identification using ultrasound and peripheral nerve stimulation.
At no fee to the organization, the PIT of Tampa also serves as a venue for national anesthesia provider organizations to host their own workshops and training sessions to educate healthcare providers.
Houston, Texas
In January 2023, we opened our second training facility, the Houston Pacira Innovation and Training Center, in Houston, Texas. This 19,000 square-foot state-of-the-art facility features a 125-seat adaptive lecture hall featuring the same liquid crystal

display video wall that the PIT of Tampa has, a broadcast studio and both wet and dry lab space for cadaver and other interactive workshops. A simulation lab is equipped with eight advanced ultrasound machines equipped with artificial intelligence and 3-D training software in addition to professional medical lighting and in-ceiling cameras. The PIT of Houston is core to developing both our physician champions and community-based clinicians who want to stay on the forefront of opioid-sparing pain management. With this new training facility, we have doubled our capacity and ability to host programs for EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera°.
DePuy Synthes Sales Inc.
In July 2020, we announced the conclusion of a co-promotion agreement with DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc., or DePuy Synthes, part of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies to market and promote the use of EXPAREL for orthopedic procedures in the U.S. market. The collaboration began in January 2017 and concluded in January 2021. During that time DePuy Synthes field representatives collaborated with the Pacira field teams to support EXPAREL use and education in orthopedic surgical settings. In addition to partnering with DePuy Synthes in support of orthopedic surgical procedures, Pacira field representatives remained the overall EXPAREL account managers and commercial leads for soft tissue surgeons, anesthesiologists and ASCs. Through this collaboration we significantly expanded the use of EXPAREL and solidified its role in opioid-sparing protocols across a range of orthopedic procedures. Our decision to conclude the partnership was due to the evolution of orthopedic practice from an inpatient hospital experience to the ambulatory setting with anesthesia-driven regional approaches playing an increasingly essential role. This growing market is already served by our field-based teams.
Other Agreements
Flexion Acquisition
On November 19, 2021, we completed the Flexion Acquisition pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Flexion Merger Agreement”), dated as of October 11, 2021, by and among us, Oyster Acquisition Company Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Pacira (“Purchaser”), and Flexion. Following the completion of a successful tender offer for the shares of Flexion’s common stock, Purchaser merged with and into Flexion with Flexion surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacira. We changed the name of Flexion to Pacira Therapeutics, Inc. after completing the merger. As part of the Flexion Acquisition, we acquired ZILRETTA, the first and only extended-release, IA (meaning in the joint) injection indicated for the management of OA knee pain. ZILRETTA is a non-opioid therapy that employs a proprietary microsphere technology to provide pain relief. The addition of ZILRETTA to our innovative non-opioid product portfolio directly aligns with our mission to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as possible and address medical needs along the neural pain pathway.
Initially, the total consideration for the Acquisition was approximately $578.8 million consisting of (i) $448.5 million of cash paid to Flexion shareholders and to settle restricted stock units and certain stock options; (ii) an $85.1 million cash payment of Flexion debt not assumed by us and (iii) $45.2 million of estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to contingent value rights that were issued to Flexion shareholders and certain equity award holders in conjunction with the Flexion Acquisition. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price with cash on hand, and the consideration is subject to adjustments based on the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments. As of December 31, 2022, these contingent value rights could aggregate up to a total of $372.3 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are met. For more information, see Note 5, Flexion Acquisition and Note 12, Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
MyoScience Acquisition
In April 2019, we completed the MyoScience Acquisition. The total consideration included an initial cash payment of $120.0 million, reduced by $1.0 million for post-closing purchase price adjustments and indemnification obligations, plus contingent milestone payments up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of which $43.0 million is available at December 31, 2022. The expiration date for the achievement of the milestones is December 31, 2023. We changed the name of MyoScience to Pacira CryoTech, Inc. after completing the merger. For more information on the contingent consideration related to the MyoScience Acquisition, refer to Note 12, Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
Research Development Foundation
Pursuant to an agreement with the Research Development Foundation, or RDF, we were required to pay RDF a low single-digit royalty on the collection of revenues from certain products for as long as certain patents assigned to us under the 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 16


Table of Contents

agreement remain valid. RDF has the right to terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by us, in connection with our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we directly or indirectly oppose or dispute the validity of the assigned patent rights.
Our U.S. Patent No. 11,033,495 issued on June 15, 2021. Thereafter, RDF asserted that the issuance of that patent extends our royalty obligations under the agreement until 2041. We disagreed and explained that the royalty period under the agreement ended on December 24, 2021 with the expiration of our U.S. Patent No. 9,585,838. Because of the disagreement over the interpretation of this agreement, in December 2021, we filed a declaratory judgment lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada (21-cv-02241). The lawsuit seeks a declaration from the court that we owe no royalties to RDF with respect to our EXPAREL product after December 24, 2021. During the pendency of the lawsuit, we will continue to pay royalties to RDF under protest, however, we are unable to predict the outcome of this action at this time.
Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.
In December 2012, we entered into an Exclusive License, Development and Commercialization Agreement and related Supply Agreement with Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Elanco Animal Health, Inc., or Aratana. Under the agreements, we granted Aratana an exclusive royalty-bearing license, including the limited right to grant sublicenses, for the development and commercialization of our bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product for use in animals. In August 2016, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, approved NOCITA® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), as a local post-operative analgesia for cranial cruciate ligament surgery in dogs (NOCITA is a registered trademark of Aratana). In August 2018, the CVM expanded the NOCITA label to include its use as a peripheral nerve block to provide regional postoperative analgesia following onychectomy in cats. In June 2019, the CVM approved a 10mL vial size for NOCITA. Aratana began purchasing our bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product in 2016.
We are eligible to receive up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of commercial milestones. Aratana is required to pay us a tiered double-digit royalty on certain net sales made in the U.S. If the product is approved by foreign regulatory agencies for sale outside of the U.S., Aratana will be required to pay us a tiered double-digit royalty on such net sales. Royalty rates will be reduced by a certain percentage upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications into certain jurisdictions or if Aratana must pay royalties to third parties under certain circumstances.
Either party has the right to terminate the license agreement in connection with (i) an insolvency event involving the other party that is not discharged in a specified period of time; (ii) a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a specified cure period or (iii) the failure to achieve a minimum annual revenue as set forth in the agreement, all on specified notice. We may terminate the agreement in connection with (i) Aratana’s failure to pay any amounts due under the agreement; (ii) Aratana’s failure to achieve regulatory approval in a particular jurisdiction with respect to such jurisdiction or (iii) Aratana’s failure to achieve its first commercial sale within a certain amount of time on a country by country basis after receiving regulatory approval, all on specified notice. Aratana may terminate the license agreement (i) upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications on a country by country basis or (ii) at any time on a country by country basis except with respect to the U.S. and any country in the E.U., all on specified notice. The parties may also terminate the license agreement by mutual consent. The license agreement will terminate automatically if we terminate the supply agreement. In the event that the license agreement is terminated, all rights to the product (on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis) will be terminated and returned to us. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the license agreement is effective until July 2033, after which Aratana has the option to extend the agreement for an additional five-year term, subject to certain requirements.
Eurofarma Laboratories S.A.
In June 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with Eurofarma for the development and commercialization of EXPAREL in Latin America. Under the terms of the agreement, Eurofarma obtained the exclusive right to market and distribute EXPAREL in 19 countries in Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Eurofarma recently submitted an application seeking approval in Brazil. In addition, Eurofarma is responsible for regulatory filings for EXPAREL in these countries. We will receive royalties based on Eurofarma’s future commercialization of EXPAREL and are also eligible to receive milestone payments that are triggered by the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial events.

Significant Customers
We had three wholesalers each comprising 10 percent or more of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022: Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Drug Company and AmerisourceBergen Health Corporation, which accounted for 31%, 23% and 22% of our total revenues, respectively. These wholesalers process orders for EXPAREL under a drop-ship program. EXPAREL is delivered directly to end-users without the wholesalers ever taking physical possession of the product. None of our customers of ZILRETTA or iovera° accounted for 10 percent or more of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Manufacturing and Research Facilities
Internal Facilities
We manufacture EXPAREL and iovera° handpieces at our facility in San Diego, California. We also have a mixed-use research and development, manufacturing and office facility which sits adjacent to our EXPAREL and iovera° manufacturing facility, and a warehouse located within five miles of these facilities. We refer to these three buildings as the Science Center Campus, and together they consist of approximately 195,000 square feet. Our manufacturing facilities are inspected regularly and approved by the FDA, EMA, MHRA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
We purchase raw materials and components from third-party suppliers to manufacture EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera°. In most instances, alternative sources of supply are available, although switching to an alternative source would, in some instances, take time and could lead to delays in manufacturing our product candidates. Suppliers may not sell these raw materials to us at the times that we need them or on commercially reasonable terms and we do not have direct control over the availability of these raw materials from our suppliers. In order to manage the risk related to raw material shortages, we strive to keep adequate supplies of key raw materials on hand and qualify additional sources of supply as appropriate.
All manufacturing of products, initial product release and stability testing are conducted by us and our manufacturing partners in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or CGMP.
Our EXPAREL manufacturing facility at the Science Center Campus is an approximately 84,000 square foot structure located on a five-acre site. It was custom built as a pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing facility. Activities in this facility include the manufacture of EXPAREL bulk product on dedicated production lines and its fill/finish into vials, microbiological and quality control testing, product storage, development of analytical methods and manufacturing of development products. We are expanding our EXPAREL manufacturing capacity at our Science Center Campus as we expect the demand for EXPAREL will increase.
Our 90,000 square-foot mixed-use research and development, manufacturing and office facility is located adjacent to our EXPAREL manufacturing facility and was completely renovated in 2020 to meet our specifications. We manufacture all of the iovera° handpieces at this facility. This building also houses our Science Center related research and development activities and general and administrative functions, as it includes both laboratories and the building infrastructure necessary to support the formulation, analytical testing, clinical and process development activities for manufacturing additional commercial product indications and new pipeline products. Our pilot plant suite for early stage clinical product production is located in this building and there is additional space for future expansion opportunities.
We also have an approximately 21,000 square foot warehouse that serves as the main CGMP warehouse for our Science Center Campus operations, primarily being used for the storage of production materials. It contains ambient as well as cold temperature CGMP warehouse storage and also features a quality control clean room for sampling incoming materials.
Distribution of our pMVL products, including EXPAREL, requires cold-chain distribution, whereby a product must be maintained between specified temperatures. We have validated processes for continuous monitoring of temperature from manufacturing through delivery to the end-users.
Co-Production Facilities
Thermo Fisher Scientific Pharma Services
In April 2014, we and Thermo Fisher entered into a Strategic Co-Production Agreement, Technical Transfer and Service Agreement and Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “EXPAREL Manufacturing and Supply Agreement”) to collaborate in the manufacture of EXPAREL. Thermo Fisher undertook certain technical transfer activities and construction services 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 18

needed to prepare Thermo Fisher’s Swindon, England facility for the manufacture of EXPAREL in two dedicated suites. We provided Thermo Fisher with the equipment necessary to manufacture EXPAREL and pay fees to Thermo Fisher based on Thermo Fisher’s achievement of certain technical transfer and construction milestones. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for certain nominal expenses and additional services. In February 2019, we announced that commercial production of EXPAREL was underway at the first Thermo Fisher suite. We are now using a second, larger-scale dedicated suite that has more than doubled our EXPAREL manufacturing capacity at the Thermo Fisher site. We began commercial production of EXPAREL out of that second suite in August 2021.
The initial term of the EXPAREL Manufacturing and Supply Agreement is 10 years from the date of FDA approval of the first manufacturing suite, which was received in May 2018. We pay fees to Thermo Fisher for their operation of the manufacturing suites and the amount of EXPAREL produced by Thermo Fisher. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for purchases made on our behalf, certain nominal expenses and additional services. We may terminate this agreement upon one month’s notice if a regulatory authority causes the withdrawal of EXPAREL from the U.S. or any other market that represents 80 percent of our overall sales, or at any time for convenience by providing between 18 and 24 months’ notice (depending on the number of years after the FDA approval date). Either party may terminate the EXPAREL Manufacturing and Supply Agreement in the event of the breach or bankruptcy of the other party.
Prior to the Flexion Acquisition, in July 2015, Flexion and Thermo Fisher entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “ZILRETTA Manufacturing and Supply Agreement”) and a Technical Transfer and Service Agreement related to the manufacture of ZILRETTA at the same Thermo Fisher site in Swindon, England where our EXPAREL suites are located. Thermo Fisher agreed to undertake certain transfer activities and construction services needed to prepare its facility for the commercial manufacture of ZILRETTA in dedicated manufacturing suites. Flexion provided Thermo Fisher with certain equipment and materials necessary to manufacture ZILRETTA. We make monthly payments to Thermo Fisher for such activities and reimburse Thermo Fisher for certain material, equipment and miscellaneous expenses and additional services.
The initial term of the ZILRETTA Manufacturing and Supply Agreement that we assumed as part of the Flexion Acquisition expires in October 2027. We pay a monthly base fee to Thermo Fisher for the operation of the manufacturing suites and a per product fee for each vial of ZILRETTA based upon a forecast of commercial demand. We also reimburse Thermo Fisher for purchases of materials and equipment made on our behalf, certain nominal expenses and additional services. The ZILRETTA Manufacturing and Supply Agreement will remain in full effect unless and until it expires or is terminated. We may terminate this agreement upon one month’s notice if a regulatory authority causes the withdrawal of ZILRETTA from the U.S. or any other market that represents 80 percent of our overall sales, or at any time for convenience by providing 24 months’ notice. Either party may terminate the ZILRETTA Manufacturing and Supply Agreement in the event of the breach or bankruptcy of the other party. Upon termination of the ZILRETTA Manufacturing Agreement (other than termination by us in the event that Thermo Fisher does not meet the manufacturing milestones or for a breach by Thermo Fisher), we will be obligated to pay for the costs incurred by Thermo Fisher associated with the removal of our manufacturing equipment and for Thermo Fisher’s termination costs up to a specified capped amount.
Carlisle Companies, Inc.
In January 2020, we and Carlisle Companies, Inc., or Carlisle, (formerly Providien Device Assembly, LLC) entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “Carlisle Agreement”) to collaborate in the manufacture of iovera° Smart Tips at Carlisle’s Tijuana, Mexico facility. The initial term of the Carlisle Agreement is five years. Under the Carlisle Agreement, we pay fees based on the amount of iovera° Smart Tips delivered by Carlisle. Since April 2022, all iovera° Smart Tips are now produced by Carlisle.
The Carlisle Agreement may be terminated by either party upon one years’ written notice without cause. We may terminate the Carlisle Agreement upon thirty days’ written notice in the event that iovera° is withdrawn from the market or no longer sold by us. Either party may terminate the Carlisle Agreement in the event of the breach or bankruptcy of the other party.

After issuance, we will submit this patent for listing in the Orange Book. After listing, the Orange Book would have a total of nine EXPAREL patents each with an expiration date of January 22, 2041.
We also own a family of U.S. and foreign patents on an alternative process to manufacture EXPAREL and other pMVL-based products. The process offers many advantages, including larger scale production and lower manufacturing costs. There are eight issued U.S. patents. Patents that claim the process and apparatus will expire at the latest in November 2033. One of the patents claims a product made by the process and expires in April 2031. As of December 31, 2022, we have four granted patents in China, one granted patent in Europe, one granted patent in Japan and one granted patent in Israel, protecting various aspects of the alternative process, including the methods of using the apparatus and the apparatus itself.
In February 2022, we filed a provisional application relating to the use of EXPAREL as stellate ganglion blocks for managing cardiac arrhythmia, including electrical storm. In October 2022, we filed a U.S. and a Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application relating to compositions of matter, processes of making and method of treatment in connection with dexamethasone sodium phosphate-pMVL product. In addition, we also filed a U.S. and a PCT application were filed relating to compositions of matter, processes of making and method of treatment in connection with a high-potency bupivacaine-pMVL product.
Patents and Patent Applications for ZILRETTA
A composition of matter patent has been issued by the USPTO for ZILRETTA, with a patent term into 2031. The USPTO has also issued two patents directed at the methods of manufacturing and using ZILRETTA with patent terms into 2031. Considerable expertise and effort were required to carry out the large body of original work underlying the formulation of ZILRETTA, including experimenting with, and observing the effects of over 50 steroid and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, or PLGA, formulations. We believe our extensive know-how and trade secrets relating to the manufacturing process for ZILRETTA, including those that relate to precise pharmaceutical release profiles, represent a meaningful entry barrier.

We own three U.S. ZILRETTA patents as well as counterpart foreign patents and patent applications covering composition of matter, methods of manufacture, and methods of use. Our U.S. ZILRETTA patents have expiration dates in 2031. The ZILRETTA composition of matter invention is the result of several unique discoveries relating to a narrow drug load specification, a certain release profile of polymers, specific polymer weights and ratios, and clinical efficacy observed within a dose-range. The U.S. patents directed to ZILRETTA’s composition of matter and methods of use are listed in the FDA Orange Book. We also have two U.S. patents directed at compositions of matter similar to ZILRETTA, as well as methods of making and using the same, with patent terms into 2031.
In 2022, we had one patent granted in Pakistan, further expanding our global intellectual property portfolio, which includes patents in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan and Ukraine. These foreign patents cover the composition of matter, methods of manufacturing, and methods of using ZILRETTA and are similar in scope to the protection in the U.S. described above.
We have also in-licensed intellectual property, owned by the Southwest Research Institute, or SwRI, which gives us exclusive rights to SwRI patents covering our proprietary microsphere manufacturing technology used in the production of ZILRETTA. These patents are scheduled to expire in 2025.
Patents and Patent Applications for iovera°
Issued patents in the U.S. afford us a wide range of coverage of various aspects of the iovera° technology. For example, several of our earliest filed patents cover the structural aspects of a handheld cryogenic device with single needle and needle arrays, tissue-penetrating needle probes that may be detachable, fused silica tubing fluid delivery paths, methods of applying cryotherapy using the cryogenic device and methods for using replaceable needle probes. These patents are set to expire between 2025 and 2032. An important patent family specifically directed to systems and methods of treating pain offers both broad and variable coverage of cryogenic device features and methods of using the same for pain management, including single-use needle probes, particular needle sizes and shapes. Patents in this family are set to expire between 2025 and 2028. Another important patent family has broad disclosure and coverage of a variety of indications for treatment by cryogenic devices, including joint function and stiffness, OA, occipital neuralgia, spasticity, neuroma and other nerve entrapment indications and is set to expire between 2033 and 2037.
Additionally, there are several patents and pending patent applications directed to other important aspects of the iovera° technology. For example, patents covering the probe filtration system are set to expire in 2033 and patents on the Smart Tip technology are set to expire between 2034 and 2037. Other patents and applications cover methods of using needles with blunt tips and aspects of cryogenic devices coupled with a neurostimulator for locating nerves and are set to expire between 2035 and 2038. There are eight new utility and design patent families covering now-commercial and developing next-generation technology, which are issued or pending in the North American, European, Japanese, Chinese and Brazilian markets, which could potentially prevent others from using this now-commercial next-generation cryogenic device until at least 2040 for utility patents and 2046 for design patents.
In addition, we also filed several provisional applications in 2022 covering the use of iovera° as stellate ganglion blocks for managing cardiac arrhythmia, including electrical storm.
PCRX-201
In December 2017, Flexion acquired the global rights to PCRX-201 from GQ Bio Therapeutics GmbH (formerly named GeneQuine BioTherapeutics GmbH), including a direct exclusive license of certain foundational patents, patent applications, and other proprietary rights owned by the Baylor College of Medicine, or Baylor, that are related to PCRX-201 for human applications. These patents generally cover the composition of matter and method of use of PCRX-201 in the treatment of OA. In 2019, the USPTO issued U.S. patent No. 10,301,647, which covers the composition of matter and method of use of PCRX-201 in the treatment of OA with a term through January 2033. In addition, the Baylor patents related to PCRX-201 are issued in Europe, with an expiry date in 2032, and in Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan and Eurasia with expiry dates in 2033. We are continuing to prosecute one U.S. Baylor patent application related to PCRX-201. Further, we have entered the national phase in Brazil, China, Europe, Japan and the U.S. based on a PCT application covering composition of matter and effective dosages of PCRX-201 in the treatment of OA in humans, which, if granted, are expected to provide protection until 2040.
We also have a U.S. application and a PCT application covering composition of matter and method of use of PCRX-201 for the treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD), which, if granted, are expected to provide protection until 2042.

Additional Intellectual Property
We have a PCT application covering composition of matter, method of use, and method of manufacture for formulations of an anesthetic drug of amino amide group (lidocaine, bupivacaine and ropivacaine) formulated in a triblock copolymer component (one or more PLGA-polyethylene glycol-PLGA triblock copolymers), which if converted and granted, is expected to provide protection until 2042.
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
Trade secrets play an important role in protecting our pMVL-based products (including EXPAREL) and pipeline, ZILRETTA and iovera° and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. The scale-up and commercial manufacture of pMVL-based and iovera° products involve processes, custom equipment and in-process and release analytical techniques that we believe are unique to us. The expertise and knowledge required to understand the critical aspects of our pMVL manufacturing steps requires knowledge of both traditional and non-traditional emulsion processing and traditional pharmaceutical production, overlaid with all of the challenges presented by aseptic manufacturing. ZILRETTA is also manufactured using custom equipment and proprietary processes with respect to certain of the formulation and manufacturing techniques related to the TA-formulated PLGA microspheres in ZILRETTA, including those that relate to its precise pharmaceutical release profile. The iovera° system relies on custom manufacturing techniques that are able to provide the precision and tight tolerances required for a self-contained handheld cryogenic device. Additionally, the iovera° device includes proprietary software for device operations during cryotherapy treatments.
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
EXPAREL
Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than EXPAREL or any other products that we are currently selling through partners or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
EXPAREL competes with well-established products with similar indications. Competing products available for postsurgical pain management include opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, each of which is available generically from several manufacturers, and several of which are available as proprietary products using novel delivery systems. Ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, is also available generically in the U.S. from several manufacturers, and Caldolor (ibuprofen for injection), an NSAID, has been approved by the FDA for pain management and fever in adults. EXPAREL also competes with currently marketed non-opioid products such as bupivacaine, marcaine, ropivacaine and other anesthetics/analgesics, all of which are also used in the treatment of postsurgical pain and are available as either oral tablets, injectable dosage forms or administered using novel delivery systems. Additional products may be developed for the treatment of acute pain, including new injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of currently available 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 22


Table of Contents

opioids and NSAIDs, long-acting local anesthetics and new chemical entities as well as alternative delivery forms of various opioids and NSAIDs. Currently EXPAREL also competes with elastomeric pumps and catheter devices intended to provide bupivacaine over several days and with off-label combinations of other approved analgesics, called “cocktails”, that are combined by compound pharmacies in an attempt to extend the duration of pain control.
ZILRETTA
Immediate-release steroids and HA injections are currently the two marketed classes of IA products that compete directly with ZILRETTA. Also available are stem cell and PRP injections, but these require on-site preparation from tissue or blood taken from the patient and have generated questionable efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Because these are minimally manipulated autologous therapies, they do not require and have not received FDA review or approval. For that reason, they are generally not reimbursed by payers, and patients must pay out of pocket to receive these therapies. Furthermore, the American Association of Hip & Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) issued a position statement indicating that it cannot recommend biologic therapies, including stem cell and PRP injections, for the treatment of advanced hip or knee arthritis.
iovera°
The medical device industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The cryotherapy pain management field in particular is a growing industry due to increased attention on opioid usage for pain, which has created a rapidly emerging market and has fueled an increased interest in opioid alternatives. Many of our competitors in our space have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products. The rise of various small and early stage companies in the cryotherapy pain management field may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors are continuously engaged in trials and attempts to develop new products or approaches in hopes of capturing the pain management market. They may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, technologies that are more effective or less costly than the iovera° system, which could render the iovera° system obsolete and noncompetitive. As a result, it is critical that we continue to innovate and to increase marketing efforts in our primary markets. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
Besides pharmaceutical products for pain management, iovera° competes with medical devices that ablate or degenerate peripheral nerves to treat indications such as joint pain, neuralgia and OA pain. Competing products include cryotherapy devices as well as other devices such as cooled radio-frequency ablation devices that block or degenerate peripheral nerves involved in conducting pain signals. Avanos Medical, Inc. markets these medical devices in the U.S. Additional non-opioid products or entirely different approaches may also be developed for pain management by one or more of our competitors.
Government Regulation 
In the U.S., prescription drug and medical device products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, safety, efficacy, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Outside the U.S., prescription drug and medical device products are regulated by comparable agencies (including the EMA and MHRA in the E.U. and U.K., respectively, as well as authorities in Canada and Latin America), laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, debarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Regulatory Environment
Pharmaceuticals
In the U.S., generally the FDA must approve any new drug, including a new use of a previously approved drug, before marketing of the drug occurs in the U.S. This process generally involves:
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 23


Table of Contents

•completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin for unapproved use in the U.S.;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•completion of process validation, quality product release and stability;
•submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the product’s manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with CGMP requirements and to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
•review and approval by the FDA of the NDA.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that the FDA will grant approvals for any of our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the trial on a clinical hold because of, among other things, concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial or about exposure of human research subjects to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Thus, submission of an IND does not by itself automatically result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. In addition, the FDA requires us to amend an existing IND for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an IRB covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial along with informed consent information for subjects before the clinical trial commences at that center. The IRB also must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time, on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or the competitive climate.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-maintained website (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and report key findings and parameters. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, typically, the conduct of human clinical trials occurs in the following three pre-market sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: Sponsors initially conduct clinical trials in a limited population, either patients or healthy volunteers, to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the cases of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing often is conducted only on patients having the specific disease. 
•Phase 2: Sponsors conduct clinical trials generally in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Sponsors may conduct multiple Phase 2 clinical trials to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: These include expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials, including pivotal clinical trials. When Phase 2 evaluations suggest the effectiveness of a dose range of the product and acceptability of such product’s safety profile, sponsors undertake Phase 3 clinical trials in larger patient populations to obtain additional information needed to evaluate the overall benefit and risk balance of the drug and to provide an adequate basis to develop labeling.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 24

Some clinical trials may be overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new drug is likely to take a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If an application is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will review and approve the NDA. In addition, sponsors may elect to conduct, or be required by the FDA to, conduct post-approval clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after NDA approval, generate new data and best-practice administration techniques. Studies in an indication after approval are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
The requirements for drug approval and the clinical trials that approvals are based on are similar in other countries, however each regulatory agency will have differing policies, procedures and processes that we must comply with in each market we wish to sell our products in. There also can be no assurance that approval or utilization of our products will be identical in different jurisdictions. For example, EXPAREL is approved in femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults in Europe, but the FDA has not approved this indication in the U.S. However, based on positive results from our Phase 3 clinical trials of EXPAREL as a femoral nerve block in lower extremity surgeries, we submitted an sNDA to the FDA in January 2023 seeking expansion of the EXPAREL label to include femoral nerve block in the adductor canal and sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa, with an anticipated FDA action date under PDUFA in the second half of 2023.
Medical Devices
In the U.S., the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FDCA and its subsequent amendments regulate the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Medical devices that require notification submitted as a 510(k) clearance request must be reviewed and cleared by the FDA before we can begin marketing them. To request 510(k) clearance, we must be able to demonstrate that the medical device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) medical device. Medical devices require extensive clinical testing which consists of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval, or PMA, applications for specific surgical indications. The FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products. A new indication for 510(k) clearance may or may not require a clinical trial. Expanding the iovera° label to include the treatment of spasticity requires a clinical trial, which we expect to begin in 2023.
Review and Approval Process
Pharmaceuticals
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, sponsors submit the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In addition, 505(b)(2) applications must contain a patent certification for each patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book that covers the drug referenced in the application and upon which the third-party studies were conducted. For some drugs, regulatory agencies may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe the drug or where it may be dispensed or administered. Currently, the FDA does not require a REMS for EXPAREL but the EMA and MHRA do.
If the FDA accepts a submission for substantive review, the FDA typically reviews the NDA in accordance with established timeframes. Under PDUFA, the FDA establishes goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system: Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that address an unmet medical need by offering major advances in treatment or providing a treatment where no adequate therapy currently exists. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Reviews of NDAs within 12 months of submission (ten months after the Day 60 filing date) and Priority Reviews within eight months of submission (six months after the Day 60 filing date). For an sNDA, the FDA aims to complete its Standard Review within 10 months of submission and Priority Reviews within six months of submission. Review processes may sometimes extend beyond these target completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding REMS or FDA workload issues, but in general under PDUFA the FDA is supposed to complete its reviews within the target timeframes despite these factors. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to the application’s approval. The recommendations of an advisory committee do not bind the FDA, but the FDA generally follows such recommendations.
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 25


Table of Contents

Under PDUFA, NDA applicants must pay significant NDA user fees upon submission. In addition, manufacturers of approved prescription drug products must pay annual program fees, as we do for EXPAREL and ZILRETTA.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with CGMP requirements and are adequate to ensure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. If the FDA requires a REMS plan, it could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may approve an NDA contingent on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials and the correction of identified manufacturing deficiencies, including the development of adequate controls and specifications. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Outside the U.S., although timelines vary as do specific regulatory procedures, the same general principals hold, including the potential for a REMS plan which could entail other requirements, including but not limited to patient registries and risk minimization tools.
Medical Devices
In the U.S., authorization to bring a medical device to market is generally obtained in one of two ways. The first pathway, a pre-market notification (the 510(k) process), requires demonstration that the new device is substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed medical device. The second pathway, a PMA, requires an independent demonstration that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. In general, PMAs require a much longer time horizon and can be much more expensive than obtaining clearance through the 510(k) process. A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if it is determined that the device is not eligible for the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate reasonable evidence of the device’s safety and efficacy to the FDA’s satisfaction.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must file with the FDA a pre-market notification demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. 510(k) clearance for a predecessor device to iovera° was first obtained in March 2009 when the focus of MyoScience was cosmetic applications (i.e. facial wrinkle reduction). MyoScience’s focus shifted to pain management in 2014, and since then there have been a number of advancements that led to three additional 510(k) submissions and clearances to support iovera° and the subsequent growth of the iovera° product line.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval, it may be changed or modified. Any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. Regulations provide that the manufacturer initially determines when a specific modification requires notification to FDA. The FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized and implemented, will result in manufacturers needing to seek a significant number of new clearances for changes made to legally marketed devices. The FDA reviews the manufacturer’s decision to file a 510(k) or PMA for modifications during facility audits.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
For pharmaceutical products, as an alternate path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act), and permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from preclinical and/or clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA to 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 26


Table of Contents

permit the applicant to rely upon the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any change from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Applications under Section 505(b)(2) are subject to any non-patent exclusivity period applicable to the referenced product, which may delay approval of the 505(b)(2) application even if the FDA has completed its substantive review and determined the drug should be approved. In addition, 505(b)(2) applications must include patent certifications to any patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book as covering the referenced product. If the 505(b)(2) applicant seeks to obtain approval before the expiration of an applicable listed patent, the 505(b)(2) applicant must provide notice to the patent owner and NDA holder of the referenced product. If the patent owner or NDA holder brings a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of such notice, the 505(b)(2) application cannot be approved for 30 months or until the 505(b)(2) applicant prevails, whichever is sooner. If the 505(b)(2) applicant loses the patent infringement suit, the FDA may not approve the 505(b)(2) application until the patent expires, plus any period of pediatric exclusivity.
In any future NDA submissions for our product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize the commercial opportunities for these product candidates.
Post-Approval Requirements
Pharmaceuticals
After approval, the NDA sponsor must comply with comprehensive requirements governing, among other things, drug listing, recordkeeping, manufacturing, marketing activities, product sampling, distribution and annual reporting. Additionally, adverse events must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion, and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for adverse events are mandated by the FDA. An adverse event is any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. A serious adverse event is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening or results in hospitalization or disability, among other things. If the events suggest a new safety signal for the drug in question, that could lead to the need for additional safety statements in the labeling of the product or additional REMS. Additionally, adverse events found in other drugs could also mean that we have to abide by additional safety measures and include warnings in our labeling. Similar reporting and pharmacovigilance obligations exist with regulatory agencies outside the U.S.
If new safety issues are identified following approval, the FDA can require the NDA sponsor to revise the approved labeling to reflect the new safety information; conduct post-market studies or clinical trials to assess the new safety information and implement a REMS program to mitigate newly identified risks. The FDA may also require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the FDA-approved label. Further, if we modify a drug, including any changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the FDA may require us to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with CGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from CGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
If after approval the FDA determines that the product does not meet applicable regulatory requirements or poses unacceptable safety risks, the FDA may take other regulatory actions, including initiating suspension or withdrawal of the NDA approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;

•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs.
Medical Devices
The FDA has broad post‑market and regulatory obligations that we must adhere to. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with QSRs and other rules and regulations. 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
•QSRs, which require manufacturers, including third‑party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during product design and throughout the manufacturing process;
•Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off‑label uses; and
•Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•the potential withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or other approvals that were previously granted; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or
•requiring us to repair, replace and/or refund the cost of any medical device we have manufactured or distributed.
If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 28


Table of Contents

the product in those countries. The approval process and requirements vary from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that necessary for FDA approval. 
For example, in Europe, there are several tracks for marketing approval for pharmaceuticals, for product approval and post-approval regulatory processes, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the CHMP, the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all E.U. member states and is recognized by the MHRA. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.
As with FDA, EMA or MHRA approval, we may not be able to secure additional regulatory approvals in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, as in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing or distribution would apply to any product that is approved in Europe, the U.K., Canada and Latin America, and failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize any product.
In addition to regulations in Europe and the U.S., we will be subject to regulations governing clinical trials, product approvals, and commercial distribution in the U.K, Canada, Latin America and any other jurisdictions in which EXPAREL, ZILRETTA, iovera° or any other future product is approved.
Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our products and product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers at the federal, state and private levels. Government payer programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy is not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures, medical devices or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment that could impact our ability to sell our products at a price level high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment, which would materially impact our results of operations.
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates owed to states by pharmaceutical manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act also established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which drug manufacturers must agree to offer 50 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand name drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. One such governmental program that was expanded as part of the Affordable Care Act is the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers that participate in Medicaid to enter into a pharmaceutical pricing agreement, or PPA, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and requires the manufacturer to extend discounts to entities covered under the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The 340B Drug Pricing Program aims to cover entities that have scarce financial resources to be able to reach the U.S.’s most financially vulnerable patient populations. There have been proposed in Congress a number of legislative initiatives regarding healthcare, including possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the Affordable Care Act. The full impact that the Affordable Care and other new laws will have on our business is uncertain. However, such laws appear likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products.
In December 2022, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, President Biden signed into law the Non-Opioids Prevent Addition in the Nation, or NOPAIN, Act, a federal mandate that requires Medicare to reimburse for non-opioid 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 29


Table of Contents

products, such as EXPAREL, used during all surgeries conducted in the ASC or hospital outpatient department (HOPD) setting. Specifically, the NOPAIN Act covers reimbursement for (i) all non-opioid medications indicated to reduce postoperative pain or produce postsurgical regional analgesia without acting upon the body’s opioid receptors; and (ii) all devices used to deliver a therapy or reduce postoperative pain or produce postsurgical or regional analgesia. Any drug or device that qualifies for reimbursement under the NOPAIN Act must have demonstrated the ability to reduce or avoid intraoperative opioid use or the quantity of opioids prescribed in a clinical trial or through data published in a peer-reviewed journal. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires time to implement the NOPAIN Act, which is currently expected to take effect beginning in January 2025.
The marketability of our products may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical and medical device pricing. Some third-party payers require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies, or place limits on the amount of reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party payer reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers or that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available so that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Marketing and Data Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. The FDA may grant three or five years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for the approval of new or supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the application. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. is available under Section 505A of the FDCA if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six-month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or non-patent exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. In the past, based on our clinical trial program for EXPAREL, the FDA granted three years of marketing exclusivity to EXPAREL, which expired in October 2014. In Europe, manufacturers qualify for 8 years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization approval and an additional two years of market exclusivity, for a total of 10 years of regulatory exclusivity.
Manufacturing Requirements
We must comply with the FDA’s CGMP requirements and comparable regulations in other countries. The CGMP provisions include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet CGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA and other authorities pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers we engage or with which we partner are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with these and other statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 30


Table of Contents

significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product or product complaints must be reported and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
Regulations Pertaining to Sales and Marketing
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug or device. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs, procedures or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or “sunshine” provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical and medical device pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create the RMAT designation. The RMAT designation is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. RMAT covers cell therapies, gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a regenerative medicine advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. For example, we intend to seek an RMAT designation from the FDA for PCRX-201. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the criteria are met, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for a regenerative medicine advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of clinical trial sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare 
Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | Page 31

providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective in February 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Environmental Matters
Our research and development processes and our manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and produce waste products, including pharmaceutical residues. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products, including those related to pharmaceutical residues. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines and/or sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is also possible that environmental issues may arise in the future which we cannot now predict.
We are working towards improving our sustainable footprint through key practices like waste reduction, water recycling, and using energy efficient equipment where possible. We have a focus on raising awareness and educating our employees on reducing our internal use of consumables and natural resources. In addition, we have a broad range of recycling and waste management initiatives at our manufacturing facilities and corporate offices. For example, at our internal manufacturing facilities we have addressed our use and recycling of paper products, aluminum cans, glass, electronics and plastic, as well as responsible disposal of non-recyclables and effective water management.
Cybersecurity
We operate a risk-based cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information. We utilize a layered approach in protecting against, and the detection of, cyber-attacks, and leverage outside partnerships to gain intelligence on threats and continue to adjust our protection mechanisms to be effective. All employees receive information security training (including data protection and fraud awareness) on an annual basis, and we use state-of-the-art technology to monitor systems for anomalous behavior. In the event an incident were to occur, a Security Incident Response Team would be convened that consists of members from many functions, including legal counsel. Additionally, we carry a Cyber Insurance policy to help cover investigation and mitigation expenses.
Although we have numerous controls to protect against common attacks, some attacks may still be effective. Our controls are designed to detect, triage and eradicate these attacks. Over the past three years, there have been no known material breaches, and no expenses related to the investigation of such breaches.
Corporate Citizenship
We are the industry leader in our commitment to non-opioid pain management and providing a non-opioid option to as many patients as possible to redefine the role of opioids as a rescue therapy only. We are dedicated to the principles of social responsibility and good corporate governance. Our Board of Directors is comprised of industry leaders with extensive and diverse experience spanning business and scientific leadership. We hold ourselves to the highest standards and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reflects the business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment. We are deeply invested in the welfare of our patients and employees, the environment and the communities where we live and work. We conduct our operations and manage our product and pipeline programs in a responsible manner and strive to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
In 2021 and 2022, we provided support for charitable medical missions in Honduras, Ghana, Zambia, Guatemala, Ecuador, Mexico and India by donating EXPAREL to help support surgeries for patients in need and have also supported the Louisiana State University Opioid Minimization Initiative as well as made a commitment to donate EXPAREL to not-for-profit children’s hospitals each year over the next three years.
