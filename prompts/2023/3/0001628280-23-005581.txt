ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a commercial-stage company engaged in the discovery and development of medications to treat severe endocrine, oncologic, metabolic and neurological disorders by modulating the effects of the hormone cortisol.
Cortisol plays a significant role in the body’s response to stress and is essential for survival. Cortisol influences metabolism and the immune system and contributes to emotional stability. Cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm that is essential to health, peaking upon awakening and decreasing during the day. Insufficient cortisol activity may lead to dehydration, hypotension, shock, fatigue and hypoglycemia. Excessive cortisol activity, known as hypercortisolism, may lead to a suppressed immune response, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, depressed mood, psychosis, wasting of the arms and legs, edema, fatigue, hypertension and other problems.
Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that cortisol reduces a patient’s immune response to oncogenesis, shields certain cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy and facilitates the growth of others. Pre-clinical and clinical data also indicate that modulating cortisol activity may improve outcomes in patients with fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), which are precursors of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and in patients at risk of weight gain caused by 
antipsychotic medications (referred to as antipsychotic induced weight gain, or “AIWG”). Pre-clinical data also suggest that modulating cortisol activity may lead to treatments for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”).
Since 2012, we have marketed Korlym (mifepristone) in the United States for the treatment of patients suffering from Cushing’s syndrome. The challenge in treating a patient with Cushing’s syndrome is modulating cortisol’s effects without either suppressing them below normal levels or disrupting cortisol’s normal diurnal rhythm. Simply reducing or destroying the ability of the body to make cortisol can cause serious harm. Cortisol activity can be modulated effectively by a drug that competes with cortisol as it attempts to bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (“GR”).
Because Korlym’s active ingredient, mifepristone, reduces the binding of excess cortisol to the GR, it can modulate the effects of abnormal levels and release patterns of cortisol without compromising cortisol’s healthy functions and rhythms. However, mifepristone also binds to the progesterone receptor (“PR”), thereby terminating pregnancy and causing other adverse effects, including endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding, a debilitating condition suffered by a significant portion of women who take Korlym.
We have discovered more than 1,000 proprietary cortisol modulators that bind to the GR but have no affinity for the PR and so do not cause Korlym’s PR-related side effects. These novel molecules are “selective” cortisol modulators: they share Korlym’s affinity for the GR, but, unlike Korlym, do not bind to the PR and therefore do not cause effects arising from antagonism of progesterone activity, such as termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. The composition of our selective cortisol modulators and their methods of use in a wide range of indications are covered by U.S. and foreign patents.
Our lead compounds have entered the clinic as potential treatments for a variety of serious disorders – Cushing’s syndrome, advanced ovarian cancer, adrenal cancer with cortisol excess, prostate cancer, ALS and NASH.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Public health restrictions put in place to reduce the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as measures voluntarily undertaken by patients, physicians, hospitals and medical clinics, have reduced our revenue growth and make it difficult to grow our Korlym business.
The pandemic’s impact on the pace of our clinical development programs has been variable. Some of our trials of indications not considered immediately life-threatening, such as Cushing’s syndrome, have experienced slower enrollment. In addition, some clinical sites have reduced the frequency with which physicians see study participants. Our trials in patients with immediately life-threatening diseases, such as our Phase 2 trial in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, have not encountered delays.
We expect that pandemic-related impediments to our business will continue so long as there are COVID-19 public health restrictions and/or risk-reducing behavior by physicians and patients.
Please see the risk factor under Item 1A of this Annual Report, “The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is continuing to adversely affect our business.”
Cushing’s Syndrome
Background. Cushing’s syndrome is the clinical manifestation of hypercortisolism. An estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome each year, resulting in approximately 3,000 new patients per year and a patient population in the United States of about 20,000, approximately half of whom are cured by surgery. Cushing’s syndrome most often affects adults between the ages of 20 and 50.
Most people with Cushing’s syndrome have one or more of the following symptoms: high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing’s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated. The preferred treatment is surgery, which, if successful, can cure the disease. In approximately half of patients, surgery is not successful because the tumor cannot be located or removed completely. Depending on the type of tumor, surgery can result in a range of complications.
Korlym. We sell Korlym in the United States, using experienced sales representatives to call on physicians caring for patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (hypercortisolism). Because many people who suffer from Cushing’s syndrome are undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate physicians and patients about screening for hypercortisolism and the role Korlym can play in treating patients with the disorder. We also have a field-based force of medical science liaisons.
We use one specialty pharmacy and one specialty distributor to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support to physicians and patients. Our policy is that no patient with Cushing’s syndrome will be denied access to Korlym for financial reasons. To help us achieve that goal, we fund our own patient support programs and donate money to independent charitable foundations that help patients pay for all aspects of their Cushing’s syndrome care, whether or not that care includes taking Korlym.
Relacorilant. We are conducting two Phase 3 trials (named GRACE and GRADIENT) of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator, relacorilant, as a treatment for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Relacorilant was well-tolerated in its Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Patients in the Phase 2 trial exhibited meaningful improvements in glucose control, hypertension, weight, liver function, coagulopathy, cognition, mood, insulin resistance and quality of life measures. Relacorilant shares Korlym’s affinity for GR, but, unlike Korlym, has no affinity for PR, and so is not the “abortion pill” and does not cause other effects associated with PR affinity, including endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. Relacorilant also does not appear to cause hypokalemia (low potassium), a potentially serious condition that is a leading cause of patients stopping treatment with Korlym. Forty-four percent of patients in Korlym’s pivotal trial experienced hypokalemia.
In the GRACE trial, each patient receives relacorilant for 22 weeks. Patients who exhibit pre-specified improvements in hypertension and/or glucose metabolism enter a 12-week, double-blind, “randomized withdrawal” phase, in which half of the patients continue receiving relacorilant and half receive placebo. The trial’s primary endpoint is the rate and degree of relapse of hypertension in patients receiving placebo measured against the rate and degree of relapse of hypertension in those continuing relacorilant. GRACE has a planned enrollment of 130 patients with Cushing’s syndrome at sites in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. If successful, we expect GRACE to provide the basis for a new drug application (“NDA”) for relacorilant as a treatment for patients with any etiology of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.
Our second Phase 3 trial of relacorilant, GRADIENT, is studying patients whose Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a benign adrenal tumor. These patients often exhibit less severe symptoms or have a more gradual course of disease than patients with other etiologies of Cushing’s syndrome, although their health outcomes are ultimately poor. Half of the patients in GRADIENT will receive relacorilant for 22 weeks and half will receive placebo. The trial’s primary endpoints are improvements in glucose metabolism and hypertension. The planned enrollment for this study is 130 patients. Many of the clinical sites in GRACE are participating in GRADIENT.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the European Commission (“EC”) have designated relacorilant as an orphan drug for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome. In the United States, relacorilant’s orphan designation confers tax credits, reduced regulatory fees and, provided we obtain approval for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, seven years of exclusive marketing rights. Benefits of orphan drug designation by the EC are similar, but also include protocol assistance from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), access to the centralized marketing authorization procedure in the European Union (“EU”) and, if we obtain approval, ten years of exclusive marketing rights in the EU for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome.
In neither the United States nor the EU does orphan drug designation shorten the drug approval process, make approval more likely or prevent competitors from marketing other drugs for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome.
FKBP5 Gene Expression Assay. The tests used to diagnose patients with hypercortisolism and optimize their treatment are imprecise and often fail to identify patients with less severe manifestations of the disease. We have developed an assay to measure expression of the gene FKBP5, which is stimulated by cortisol activity, and have completed analytical validation pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). Clinical data indicate that FKBP5 levels are high in patients suffering from hypercortisolism (i.e., excess cortisol activity), but subside when they are successfully treated. We are testing this hypothesis in the GRACE and GRADIENT trials. We believe successful development of this assay will enable physicians to identify new patients with hypercortisolism more easily and to better treat those already in their care.
Oncology
There is substantial evidence that cortisol activity at the GR reduces the efficacy of certain anti-cancer therapies and that modulating cortisol’s activity may help anti-cancer treatments achieve their intended effect. In some cancers, cortisol retards cellular apoptosis – the tumor-killing effect many treatments are meant to stimulate. In other cancers, cortisol activity promotes tumor growth. Cortisol also suppresses the body’s immune response; activating – not suppressing – the immune system is beneficial in fighting certain cancers. Many types of solid tumors express the GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them ovarian, adrenal and prostate cancer.
Relacorilant in Patients with Advanced Ovarian Cancer. In May 2021, we announced preliminary results from our 178-patient, controlled, multi-center, Phase 2 trial of relacorilant combined with nab-paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Study participants were randomized to one of three treatment arms: 60 women received 150 mg of relacorilant 
intermittently (the day before, the day of and the day after their weekly nab-paclitaxel infusion) and 58 women received a daily relacorilant dose of 100 mg per day in addition to nab-paclitaxel. Sixty women received nab-paclitaxel alone. The trial’s primary endpoint was progression-free survival (i.e., the time from random assignment in a clinical trial to disease progression or death from any cause or “PFS”).
Patients in both of the relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel treatment arms experienced longer PFS than did the patients who received nab-paclitaxel alone. Patients who received a higher dose of relacorilant intermittently exhibited a statistically significant improvement in median PFS (5.6 months versus 3.8 months, hazard ratio: 0.66; p-value: 0.038). Patients who received a lower dose of relacorilant daily exhibited a median PFS that was 1.5 months longer than did the patients who received nab-paclitaxel alone (5.3 months versus 3.8 months, hazard ratio: 0.83; p-value: not significant). Patients who received relacorilant intermittently also had a longer median duration of response (“DoR”) (5.6 months versus 3.7 months, hazard ratio: 0.36; p-value: 0.006) compared to those who received nab-paclitaxel alone. Patients who received relacorilant intermittently also lived longer (median OS: 13.9 months versus 12.2 months, hazard ratio: 0.67; p-value: 0.066) compared to those who received nab-paclitaxel alone.
Safety and tolerability of relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel were comparable to nab-paclitaxel monotherapy.
In June 2022, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 trial (“ROSELLA”) that seeks to replicate the positive results observed in our Phase 2 study. ROSELLA has a planned enrollment of 360 women with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, randomized 1:1 to receive either relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. The primary endpoint is PFS, with overall survival as a key secondary endpoint. Patients in ROSELLA will have received prior bevacizumab therapy, which is the standard of care in the United States for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Women with a history of tumors that do not respond to initial platinum-based treatments (i.e., women with “primary platinum-refractory” disease) and those who have received more than three prior lines of therapy will be excluded.
In our Phase 2 trial, women who met the entry criteria for ROSELLA and received relacorilant intermittently experienced significantly improved PFS (median: 7.3 months versus 3.7 months, hazard ratio: 0.40; p-value: 0.005) and OS (median: 17.9 months versus 12.6 months, hazard ratio: 0.38; p-value: 0.011) relative to patients in the comparator arm. The patients in the intermittent arm also experienced a significant improvement in DoR relative to those in the comparator arm (median: 5.6 months versus 3.1 months, hazard ratio: 0.29; p-value: 0.016).
Relacorilant in Patients with Adrenal Cancer with Cortisol Excess. We are conducting an open-label, Phase 1b trial of relacorilant plus the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable adrenal cancer whose tumors produce cortisol. The trial is examining whether adding relacorilant to pembrolizumab therapy reduces cortisol-activated immune suppression sufficiently to help pembrolizumab achieve its intended tumor-killing effect. Relacorilant is also expected to treat the patients’ Cushing’s syndrome generated by their tumors’ excess production of cortisol.
Relacorilant in Patients with Prostate Cancer. Androgen deprivation is the standard treatment for prostate cancer because androgens stimulate prostate tumor growth. Tumors often escape androgen deprivation therapy when cortisol’s activity at the GR stimulates tumor growth. Combining a cortisol modulator with an androgen modulator may block this escape route. Our collaborators at the University of Chicago plan to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of relacorilant plus enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer, pre-prostatectomy. We are providing relacorilant and placebo for the study and have licensed patents covering the use of relacorilant combined with anticancer agents such as enzalutamide in the treatment of patients with this indication.
ALS
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a devastating neuromuscular illness. Our selective cortisol modulator dazucorilant improved motor performance and reduced neuroinflammation and muscular atrophy in animal models of ALS. Following these compelling results, in October 2022 we initiated a Phase 2 trial of dazucorilant (the “DAZALS” trial) in patients with ALS. DAZALS has a planned enrollment of 198 patients, randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 150 mg or 300 mg of dazucorilant or placebo daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the difference between dazucorilant and placebo demonstrated by patients on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R).
Metabolic Diseases
Liver Disease. NASH is an advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that afflicts millions of patients and is a leading cause of liver-related mortality. In April 2021, we suspended our Phase 2a trial of our selective cortisol modulator miricorilant as a potential treatment for NASH after four of the five patients who received miricorilant exhibited both elevated liver enzymes and large rapid reductions in liver fat. Liver enzyme levels in all affected patients returned to baseline or below baseline after miricorilant was withdrawn. Our ongoing Phase 1b dose-finding trial in patients with presumed NASH has 
identified a range of doses that appear to cause large reductions in liver fat without causing excessive liver irritation. We plan to start a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2023.
AIWG. In the United States, six million people take antipsychotic medications such as olanzapine and risperidone to treat illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. While these drugs are very effective, they often cause rapid and sustained weight gain, other metabolic disturbances and, ultimately, cardiovascular disease. Patients taking these medications experience a 10 to 25-year reduction in life expectancy, due largely to increased cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. Patients in our two double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trials of miricorilant (GRATITUDE and GRATITUDE II) did not experience reversal of AIWG. However, multiple replicated pre-clinical results as well as the results of our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology (Hunt et al., 2021)) suggest that miricorilant has the potential to significantly reduce weight gain caused by the administration of olanzapine. Accordingly, we plan to further study miricorilant’s potential to prevent AIWG.
Development of our Other Selective Cortisol Modulators
Our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators consists of four structurally distinct series. More than 1,000 of these compounds, including relacorilant, exicorilant, miricorilant and dazucorilant, potently bind to the GR but not the progesterone, estrogen or androgen receptors. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering these compounds and their methods of use in a wide range of indications. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering the composition and method of use of our products and product candidates. See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
We continue to identify selective cortisol modulators and plan to advance the most promising of them towards the clinic.
Studies by Independent Investigators
For many years we have advanced our understanding of cortisol modulation by supporting the work of independent academic investigators. These researchers have studied the potential utility of mifepristone and our proprietary selective cortisol modulators in a wide range of disorders, including central serous retinopathy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, alcoholism, cocaine addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Cushing’s syndrome, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, sarcoma, melanoma and solid tumors, including triple-negative breast, prostate, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers.
Clinical Trial Agreements
We typically conduct our clinical trials with the assistance of clinical research organizations (“CROs”). ICON plc is helping us conduct our GRACE and GRADIENT trials. Syneos Health is helping us conduct our ROSELLA trial. Julius Clinical is helping us conduct our DAZALS trial. We may terminate our agreements with ICON, Syneos Health and Julius Clinical on 60 days’ written notice.
Research and Development Spending
We incurred $131.0 million, $113.9 million and $114.8 million of research and development expense in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which accounted for 45 percent, 47 percent and 51 percent, respectively, of our total operating expenses in those years.
Manufacturing Korlym
We rely on contract manufacturers to produce Korlym and our product candidates. In March 2014, we entered into an agreement with Produits Chimiques Auxiliaires et de Synthese SA (“PCAS”) to produce mifepristone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in Korlym. In 2018, we amended this agreement and extended its term to December 31, 2021, with two one-year renewals that will occur automatically unless either party gives 12 months advance written notice of its intent not to renew. The amendment also provides for exclusivity between PCAS and Corcept, unless PCAS is unable to meet our requirements, in which case we may purchase mifepristone from another supplier. At December 31, 2021, the agreement was extended through December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the agreement was further extended through December 31, 2023.
We have agreements with two third-party manufacturers to produce and bottle Korlym tablets.
Competition for Korlym
Korlym competes with established treatments, including surgery, radiation and other medications, including “off-label” uses of drugs such as ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication, and metyrapone, which is approved for testing hypothalamic-
pituitary function. Korlym also competes with Signifor® (pasireotide) Injection and Isturisa® (osilodrostat). Both of these drugs are approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work, and both are sold by the Italian pharmaceutical company Recordati S.p.A (“Recordati”). Cushing’s disease is a subset of Cushing’s syndrome. In the EU, osilodrostat is also approved as a treatment for Cushing’s syndrome. Korlym also competes with Recorlev® (levoketoconazole), a chiral form of the commonly-prescribed cortisol synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole, that is sold by Xeris Biopharma Holdings, Inc. (“Xeris”), as a treatment for patients with Cushing’s syndrome.
The orphan drug marketing exclusivity period for Korlym ended in February 2019, which means a competitor that receives FDA approval for a generic equivalent of Korlym may market its drug to patients with Cushing’s syndrome, provided doing so would not infringe any of our patents. We sued Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) in federal district court to prevent them from marketing generic versions of Korlym in violation of our patents. In addition, Teva challenged the validity of one of our patents in a post grant review (“PGR”) proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”). In November 2020, the PTAB decided all of Teva’s claims in this PGR in Corcept’s favor. On March 12, 2021, Teva appealed its loss to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 7, 2021, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the PTAB’s decision, upholding the validity of all claims in this PGR in Corcept’s favor. See “Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.”
Intellectual Property
Overview. Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We own U.S. composition of matter patents related to our next-generation cortisol modulators. Foreign counterparts of some of these patents have issued in Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia and other countries. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2025 to 2039.
We also own U.S. and foreign patents directed to the use of our selective cortisol modulators in the treatment of a variety of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome, various cancers, fatty liver disease, antipsychotic-induced weight gain, and other disorders.
We continue to file patent applications in the United States and abroad. There can be no guarantee that any of these applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth we are seeking or that competitors or other third parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued.
We believe our patents are valid and that the production and use of our patented compounds and methods do not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we believe we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third parties except the University of Chicago, from which we have licensed certain patents, as described below.
Cushing’s Syndrome. The composition of matter patent covering Korlym’s active ingredient, mifepristone, has expired. We own U.S. method of use patents directed to the use of Korlym in the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, with expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2038. Furthermore, we own U.S. compound and method of use patents using our proprietary selective cortisol modulators directed to the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, with expiration dates ranging from 2033 to 2040.
Oncology. We own U.S. patents covering methods of treating cancer using our proprietary selective cortisol modulators with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2041. In addition, we have exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago U.S. patents for (a) the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, and (b) the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). We are required to pay the University of Chicago customary milestone fees and royalties on revenue from products commercialized under the issued patents or patents that may issue pursuant to the pending applications. Our license will end upon expiration of the licensed patents in 2031 and 2033 or upon notification by us to the University of Chicago. See “Business – License Agreements.”
We hold U.S. and international patents covering relacorilant’s composition of matter, as well as U.S. patents covering its use to treat patients with ovarian and pancreatic cancer. We also own or have exclusively licensed U.S. and European patents covering the use of GR modulators, including relacorilant, to treat a variety of disorders, including CRPC and other solid tumors. Relacorilant has been designated an orphan drug in both the United States and the EU for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Other Indications. In addition to the United States and foreign patents we own or have licensed relating to Cushing’s syndrome and various cancers, we also own U.S. and foreign patents for the use of cortisol modulators to treat AIWG, fatty liver disease, delirium, catatonia, psychosis induced by interferon-alpha therapy, migraine headaches, gastroesophageal reflux disease, neurological damage in premature infants and in the treatment of diseases using combination steroid and GR antagonist therapy. We also own patents covering the improvement of therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy and inhibition of 
cognitive deterioration in adults with Down’s Syndrome. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2023 to 2039.
Government Regulation
Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-approval regulation governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, and advertising and promotion of the products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. All of our product candidates require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization and are subject to continued regulatory oversight thereafter. Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States the FDA generally requires completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug’s intended use and approval by the FDA. Complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics characteristics of the drug, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
•Phase 1. The product candidate is administered to a small number of healthy subjects or patients with the target disease or condition to provide preliminary information as to its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and sometimes to provide preliminary information as to its activity and/or efficacy.
•Phase 2. The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate its preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and to identify possible adverse events and safety risks.
•Phase 3. The product candidate is administered to a larger group of patients with the target disease or condition to further evaluate dosage, establish its risk/benefit ratio and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
The FDA and the institutional review boards associated with clinical trial sites closely monitor the progress of clinical trials conducted in the United States and may reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate a trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable risks. The FDA may also require that additional trials be conducted to address and evaluate any potential safety risks.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, drug developers will submit the results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is sufficient to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, and six months for priority review, which the FDA may undertake, in its sole discretion, if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed drugs. FDA approvals may not be granted on a timely basis or at all.
In addition, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means 
that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
If the FDA approves the marketing of a new drug, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. The FDA may withdraw its approval at any time if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. The holder of an approved NDA must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including reports of adverse patient experiences, which could cause the FDA to impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or remove the drug from the market. The FDA may also require post-approval studies, referred to as “Phase 4 studies,” to monitor or further explore the effect of approved products, and may limit marketing of the drug based on the results of such studies.
In addition, most changes to an approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. The FDA imposes complex regulations regarding the promotion and sale of pharmaceuticals, including standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. In addition, facilities involved in the manufacture of drugs must comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”) and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter or untitled letter directing a company to correct deviations from FDA regulations, mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling, the issuance of corrective information, clinical holds, restrictions on manufacturing, product recalls, product detentions or seizures, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements and injunctions, in addition to state and federal civil and criminal penalties.
Marketing Approvals Outside the United States
If we choose to distribute our product candidates outside the United States, we will have to complete an approval process similar to the one imposed by the FDA. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional preclinical and clinical trials. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the United States, which pricing may be too low to generate an acceptable return. We are not seeking regulatory approval to market Korlym outside the United States.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which they will be covered by government health care programs and commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services, although this trend has not to-date had a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenues. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could limit our revenue. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our products could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Examples of legislation in this area include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) which was passed in 2010, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). The ACA substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA, among other things, expanded Medicaid program eligibility and access to commercial health insurance coverage, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and promoted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law on August 16, 2022, which, among other things, requires the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to negotiate the price of a set number of high Medicare spend drugs starting in 2026, requires rebates from manufacturers who increase their drug prices above inflation, and makes several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that will increase manufacturer liability for drug costs previously borne by the government and beneficiaries under the program. We also expect there to be other healthcare reform measures that could impact coverage, reimbursement, and drug prices.
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to the laws and regulations outlined in the “Government Regulations” section, we are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states where we conduct business. These laws include, without 
limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physicians’ sunshine (e.g. transparency) laws and regulations. Foreign governments have comparable regulations, and violating these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction could result in significant criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians and other third parties. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations, and in the absence of substantive guidance, it is possible for future initiatives or engagements with healthcare professionals to be challenged under this Statute, which could adversely impact our operations. While this Statute has a number of exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that safeguard certain common, industry practices from prosecution, these exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly defined, and parties must satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor to avoid scrutiny. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. For example, through legislative action, the government may assert that an Anti-Kickback Statute violation could implicate the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought directly by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual (acting as a “whistleblower”) in the name of the government. In addition, as noted directly above, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties including treble damages, and carry the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The federal government has and continues to use the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in connection with the potential or actual false claims resulting from promotion of products for unapproved uses or other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act and individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. We expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating potential or actual violations of the False Claims Act.
The federal criminal statute on false statements makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully (in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services): (i) falsify, conceal, or cover up any material fact, (ii) make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or (iii) make or use any materially false writing or document while knowing such writings or documents contain materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements.
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law provides the government the ability to impose civil monetary penalties against any party or entity who offers or transfers anything of value to a federal health care program beneficiary when a party or entity knows or should know that providing a transfer of value is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier for the order or receipt of any item or service reimbursable by a federal health care program. Notably, while pharmaceutical and biotech companies are generally not considered “providers, practitioners, or suppliers,” offering anything of value to a beneficiary that is likely to influence the beneficiary to select a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier (e.g., a physician or pharmacy) could implicate the Civil Monetary Penalties Law.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation.
The federal physician Payments Sunshine Act (generally referred to as the Open Payments™ Program) is a provision under the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). The Open Payments Program imposes reporting requirements on covered entities (e.g., drug manufacturers) for payments made or transfers of value provided by them to certain healthcare organizations (e.g., teaching hospitals) and physicians, which is broadly defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and certain non-physician practitioners (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives). Covered entities are also required to report ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members (as it relates to the Covered entities). This information is then analyzed and made public, available via searchable databases. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for any payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an 
annual submission. Similarly, certain states also mandate the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Some of these states also require the implementation of commercial compliance programs and impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices.
Federal and state agencies continue to spend time, energy and resources combating healthcare fraud and abuse. This regulatory environment, taken together with the evolving commercial compliance environment and the need to build, enhance and maintain robust and expandable systems and controls to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
In addition to the above “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, we must also account for other applicable state and foreign laws and regulations that could impact our business activities. For example, some states require pharmaceutical companies to certify that they are in compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and certain federal government compliance guidance, while other states (and some local governments) require the public registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws and regulations govern the collection of, disclosure of, use of, access to, transfer of, and confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. 
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. In 2022, the FTC also began a rulemaking proceeding to develop additional data privacy rules and requirements, which may add additional complexity to compliance obligations going forward.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. Further, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which took effect on January 1, 2020, created individual privacy rights for California consumers and increased the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) revised and expanded the CCPA, adding additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The CPRA is in full effect as of January 1, 2023, and similar laws passed in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah will take effect starting in 2023. As a result, additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. Additional legislation 
proposed at the federal level and in other states, along with increased regulatory action, reflect a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.
In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect in May 2018 and imposes stringent data protection requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons within the EU. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU or the European Economic Area (“EEA”) as well as to those outside the EU or the EEA if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the EC does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws. Transfers of personal information out of the European Union face a constantly shifting set of requirements, as courts in Europe have invalidated intergovernmental agreements and European regulators have required changes to standard contracting terms, which themselves do not fit all situations. As a result, significant uncertainty exists with respect to GDPR compliance and the attendant obligations going forward as the regulatory environment is rapidly developing. In addition, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The EC has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the EC re-assesses and renews/extends that decision. Outside Europe, significant data privacy regulatory regimes exist in major markets including Brazil, India, China, and elsewhere. The ever-shifting landscape of global data privacy regulation requires significant investment and attention to avoid significant noncompliance liabilities.
