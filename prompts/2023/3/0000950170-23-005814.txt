Item 1. Business
Runway Growth Finance Corp.
 Runway Growth Finance Corp. ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation formed on August 31, 2015, is structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. On August 18, 2021, we changed our name to "Runway Growth Finance Corp." from "Runway Growth Credit Fund Inc." We are a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to high growth-potential companies in technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services, select consumer services and products and other high-growth industries. Our goal is to create significant value for our stockholders, and the entrepreneurs we support, by providing high growth-potential companies with hybrid debt and equity financing that is more flexible than traditional credit and less dilutive than equity. Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to our stockholders primarily through current income on our loan portfolio, and secondarily through capital appreciation on our warrants and other equity positions. Our offices are in Chicago, Illinois; Woodside, California; San Diego, California; Dallas, Texas; and New York, New York.
 We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "1940 Act"). We have also elected to be treated as regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), currently qualify, and intend to continue to qualify for treatment as a RIC. While we intend to qualify to be treated as a RIC annually, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. If we fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any net taxable income for such year. See "— Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.
 From the commencement of investment operations on December 16, 2016, through December 31, 2022, we funded 57 portfolio companies and invested $1.6 billion in debt investments. As of December 31, 2022, our debt investment portfolio consisted of 56 debt investments in 35 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $1,094 million while our equity portfolio consisted of 48 warrant positions, three preferred stock positions and four common stock positions in 42 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $32.5 million. As of December 31, 2022, 98.8%, or $1.08 billion, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of senior term loans. As of December 31, 2022, our net assets were $576.1 million, and all of our debt investments were secured by all or a portion of the tangible and intangible assets of the applicable portfolio company. The debt investments in our portfolio are generally not rated by any rating agency. If the individual debt investments in our portfolio were rated, they would be rated below "investment grade." Debt investments that are unrated or rated below investment grade are sometimes referred to as "junk bonds" and have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted annualized yield of 13.71%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted annualized yield of 13.77%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted annualized yield of 14.91%. We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted debt investments for any period measured as (1) total related investment income during the period divided by (2) the daily average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding during the period. As of December 31, 2022, our debt investments had a dollar-weighted average outstanding term of 56 months at origination and a dollar-weighted average remaining term of 44 months, or approximately 3.7 years. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our debt investments had an original committed principal amount of between $6.0 million and $85.0 million, repayment terms of between 36 months and 62 months and pay cash interest at annual interest rates of between 5.69% and 15.79%.

The following table shows our dollar-weighted annualized yield by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020:
 

 | Fair Value(1) | | Cost(2) 
 | Years Ended December 31, | | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Investment type: | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Debt investments | | 13.71 | | % | | 13.77 | % | | 14.91 | % | 13.50 | % | 13.52 | % | 14.60 | %
Equity interest | | 3.42 | | % | | 2.68 | % | | 3.59 | % | 3.28 | % | 3.43 | % | 3.45 | %
All investments | | 13.22 | | % | | 12.74 | % | | 13.88 | % | 13.00 | % | 12.78 | % | 13.57 | %

 
(1)We calculate the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type for any period as (a) total related investment income during the period divided by (b) the daily average of the fair value of the investment type outstanding during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors.
 (2)We calculate the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type for any period as (a) total related investment income during the period divided by (b) the daily average of the investment type outstanding during the period, at amortized cost. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors.
 We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the "JOBS Act"). We could remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO, which occurred on October 25, 2021, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, (ii) December 31 of the fiscal year in which we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b‑2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months), or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.
 About RGC
 We are externally managed by Runway Growth Capital LLC ("RGC" or the "Adviser"), an investment adviser that has registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Advisers Act"). Runway Administrator Services LLC (the "Administrator"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RGC, provides all administrative services necessary for us to operate. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors ("Board of Directors"), RGC manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services pursuant to an investment advisory agreement, as amended and restated (the "Advisory Agreement").

 Investment Committee
 RGC’s investment committee (the "Investment Committee") consists of R. David Spreng, who is its Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, as well as our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Thomas B. Raterman, RGC’s Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Greg Greifeld, Managing Director, Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Head of Credit at RGC, and Brian Laibow, OCM Growth Holdings, LLC’s appointee. The Investment Committee meets regularly to consider our investments, review our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by RGC on our behalf. In addition, the Investment Committee reviews and monitors the performance of our investment portfolio. Each investment must be approved by a majority of the Investment Committee. In addition, Mr. Spreng, as Chairman of the Investment Committee, has the right to veto the approval of any investment, and any investment by us that is outside of certain agreed upon investment criteria requires the affirmative vote of OCM Growth Holdings, LLC’s appointee to the Investment Committee. See "— Oaktree Strategic Relationship" below for more information.
Board Approval of the Advisory Agreement
 Our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who were not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us or RGC, approved the Advisory Agreement at a virtual meeting on April 7, 2021 and recommended that our stockholders approve the Advisory Agreement. In reliance upon certain exemptive relief granted by the SEC in connection with the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Directors undertook to ratify the Advisory Agreement at its next in-person meeting which was held in July 2021. The Advisory Agreement became effective on May 27, 2021 upon approval by the stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders of the Company. The Advisory Agreement amended the prior advisory agreement to include certain revisions to the management and incentive fee calculation mechanisms and clarify language relating to liquidity events. In its consideration of the approval of the Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:
 •the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to us by RGC under the terms of the Advisory Agreement;
 •our investment performance and the investment performance of RGC;
 •comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives;
 •information about the services being performed and the personnel performing such services under the Advisory Agreement;
 •our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives, including expenses related to investment due diligence, travel and investigating and monitoring investments;
 •any existing and potential sources of indirect income to RGC from its relationship with us and RGC’s profitability; and
 •the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as we grow and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our stockholders.
 Our Board of Directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. Our Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination. Rather, our Board of Directors based its approval on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted by, it. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Based on its review of the above-mentioned factors and discussion of the Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors approved the Advisory Agreement as being in our and our stockholders’ best interests and recommended that our stockholders approve the Advisory Agreement as well.
 Duration and Termination
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Advisory Agreement will continue automatically for successive annual periods provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) (A) the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board of Directors or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, RGC or our respective affiliates. The Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, and may be terminated, without penalty, upon not more than 60 days’ written notice, by (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board of Directors, including a majority of our directors who are not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, RGC or our respective affiliates, or (iii) RGC. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Structure — RGC and our Administrator have the right to resign upon not more than 60 days’ notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement for either within that time, or at all, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K.
About Our Administrator
 We have entered into the Administration Agreement with our Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RGC, pursuant to which our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay our Administrator an amount equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board of Directors) of our Administrator’s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs associated with performing compliance functions.
Oaktree Strategic Relationship
 In December 2016, we and RGC entered into a strategic relationship with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"). Oaktree is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in credit strategies. The firm was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid‑1980s in high yield bonds, convertible securities, distressed debt, real estate, control investments and listed equities. Oaktree is a leader among global investment managers specializing in alternative investments, with $170.0 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2022. The firm emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in credit, private equity, real assets and listed equities. The firm has over 1,050 employees and offices in 20 cities worldwide.
 In connection with the strategic relationship, OCM Growth Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("OCM") managed by Oaktree, purchased an aggregate of 14,571,334 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $219.3 million in our Initial Private Offering and our Second Private Offering (the "OCM Commitment"). As of December 31, 2022, OCM owns 21,129,668 shares of our common stock or 52% of our total issued and outstanding shares. OCM has granted a proxy to us pursuant to which the shares held by OCM will be voted in the same proportion as our other stockholders vote their shares.
 In connection with the OCM Commitment, we entered into a stockholder agreement, dated December 15, 2016, with OCM, pursuant to which OCM has a right to nominate a member of our Board of Directors for election for so long as OCM holds shares of our common stock in an amount equal to, in the aggregate, at least one-third (33%) of OCM’s initial $125.0 million capital commitment. Brian Laibow, Co-Head of North America & Managing Director of Oaktree's Global Opportunities Funds, serves on our Board of Directors as OCM’s director nominee and is considered an interested director. OCM also holds a minority interest in RGC and has the right to appoint a member of RGC’s board of managers and a member of the Investment Committee. Brian Laibow is OCM’s appointee to RGC’s board of managers and Investment Committee. OCM also purchased additional equity in RGC in connection with its commitment to the Company.
 Investment Strategy and Approach
 Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to our stockholders primarily through current income on our loan portfolio, and secondarily through capital appreciation on our warrants and other equity positions. We invest in senior secured term loans and other senior debt obligations and may on occasion invest in second lien loans. We have and continue to expect to acquire warrants and other equity securities from portfolio companies in connection with our investments in loans to these companies.
 We focus on lending to late and growth stage companies in technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services, select consumer services and products and other high-growth industries.
We are typically the sole lender to our portfolio companies and do not actively syndicate the loans we originate to other lenders nor do we participate in syndications built by other lenders.
We originate our investments through two strategies: Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending. In addition to our core strategy of providing Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending, we may also opportunistically participate in the secondary markets for investments that are consistent with our broader investment strategy.
 We seek to construct a balanced portfolio with diversification among sponsored and non-sponsored transactions, diversification among sponsors within the Sponsored Growth Lending strategy, diversification among industry, geography, and stage of development, all contributing to a favorable risk adjusted return for the portfolio viewed as a whole. Borrowers tend to use the proceeds of our financings to invest in sales and marketing, expand capacity of the overall business or refinance existing debt.
 Sponsored Growth Lending.  Our Sponsored Growth Lending generally includes loans to late and growth stage companies that are already backed by established venture capital and private equity firms. Our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy typically includes the receipt of warrants and/or other equity from the venture-backed companies.
We believe that our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy is particularly attractive because the loans we make typically have higher investment yields relative to lending to larger, more mature companies and usually include additional equity upside potential. We believe our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy:
 •provides us access to many high-quality companies backed by top-tier venture capital and private equity investors;
 •delivers consistent returns through double-digit loan yields; and
 •often offers us the ability to participate in equity upside of portfolio companies through the acquisition of warrants.
 Non-Sponsored Growth Lending. Our Non-Sponsored Growth Lending strategy generally includes loans to late and growth stage, private companies that are funded directly by entrepreneurs and founders, or companies that no longer require institutional equity investment (which may selectively include publicly traded companies). We refer to these target borrowers as "non-sponsored growth companies".
 Generally, financing available to these non-sponsored companies is predicated on the underlying value of the business’s assets, in can orderly liquidation scenario, and/or the entrepreneur’s own personal financial resources. These options frequently provide insufficient capital to fund growth plans and do not consider the underlying enterprise value of the business which may be substantial relative to the value of tangible assets deployed in the business. We are frequently the only senior lender to non-sponsored growth companies and evaluate business fundamentals, the commitment of the entrepreneur and secondary sources of repayment in our underwriting approach.
 Exemptive Relief
As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which RGC or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with our investment adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. On August 10, 2020, we, RGC, and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by RGC were granted an exemptive order (the "Order") that permits us greater flexibility than the 1940 Act permits to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our Board of Directors determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by RGC or its affiliates in a manner consistent with the our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that the ability to co-invest with similar investment structures and accounts sponsored or managed by RGC or its affiliates will provide additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Under the terms of the Order, a majority of our independent directors are required to make certain determinations in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors.
 On August 30, 2022, we received an amendment to our existing Order to permit us to, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds even if such other funds had not previously invested in such existing portfolio company. Without this amended Order, such affiliated funds that are private funds would not be able to participate in such co-investments with us unless the affiliated funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with us.
Market Opportunity
 We believe that the market environment is favorable for us to continue to pursue an investment strategy primarily focused on late stage and high-growth companies in technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services, select consumer services and products and other high-growth industries.

Focus on Innovative Companies Across a Variety of High-Growth Industries
 Diversified high growth-potential industries: We target companies active in industries that support high growth-potential. Our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy is focused on the largest industry sectors where venture capital investors are active, primarily technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services, select consumer services and products and other high-growth industries. These industries’ continued growth is supported mostly by ongoing innovation and performance improvements in specific products as well as the adoption of innovative technologies and services across virtually all industries in response to competitive pressures. Term debt has been a loan product used by many of the largest, most successful venture-backed companies.
 Sponsored and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending Represents an Attractive Source of Funding
 Sponsored Growth Lending: An attractive market opportunity exists for a lender that invests in secured loans to late and growth stage companies that have not yet achieved profitability. Sponsored growth lending provides an attractive source of funds for venture-backed companies, their management teams, and their equity capital investors, as it:
 •is typically less dilutive and complements equity financing from venture capital and private equity funds;
 •often extends the time period during which a company can operate before seeking additional equity capital or pursuing a sale transaction or other liquidity event; and
 •generally allows companies to better match cash sources with uses.
 Non-Sponsored Growth Lending: An attractive market opportunity exists for a lender that invests in secured loans to late and growth stage companies that have reached profitability and need long-term growth capital but do not want the challenges that come with selling equity to venture capital or private equity firms. Non-Sponsored Growth Lending often provides all or some of the following benefits to our borrowers:
 •access to growth capital without the requirement to take on institutional-size investments that may exceed the company’s capital requirements;
 •tax deductible interest payments;
 •no significant operational involvement;
 •no personal guarantees;
 •very modest dilution, if any; and
 •no loss of managerial control or forced redemption.
 Large and Growing Market for Debt Financing to Venture Capital-Backed Companies
 Healthy, stable venture environment: Approximately 15,000 companies received venture capital financing in 2022, according to the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor, a quarterly report published jointly by NVCA and Pitchbook on venture capital activity ("Pitchbook-NVCA"), and approximately 9.8% of these transactions were first-round financings. Since 2006, the annual level of venture deal volume has increased to and is at about $238 billion of total volume in 2022. The significant increase in investment amounts beginning in 2014 through 2022 is largely the result of growth investments in later-stage companies that are staying private longer. The venture debt lending market, as defined in the Q4 2022 Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor, is estimated at $31.8 billion or roughly 13.3% of total U.S. venture capital deal value.
Growing pool of target companies: The average time from initial venture capital investment to transaction exit of such investment, either by an initial public offering or merger and acquisition transaction, has lengthened considerably. According to the Pitchbook-NVCA 2016 Yearbook, in 1998 the average number of years from initial venture investment to initial public offering of a U.S. venture capital-backed company was 3.1 years and the average number of years from initial venture investment to merger and acquisition transaction was 4.5 years. These numbers have steadily increased and have ranged between 6.0 years and 6.3 years from 2017 through 2020. According to the Q4 2022 Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor, the current average time from initial venture investment to exit transaction is now 6.3 years. Exit transactions are a small proportion of companies financed by venture capital each year. As a result, the pool of target companies has grown larger with increased demand for private capital.
Highly Fragmented, Underserved Market with High Barriers to Entry
 Many viable venture-backed companies have been unable to obtain sufficient growth financing from traditional lenders, such as commercial banks or asset-based finance companies, because traditional lenders normally underwrite to tangible asset values and/or operating cash flows. If such firms do provide financing, their loans normally contain financial performance covenants stipulating tangible asset coverage or setting standards of operating performance that do not apply to our target companies. Because sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending require specialized underwriting and investment structures that fit the distinct characteristics of venture-backed companies and non-sponsored growth companies, more traditional lending approaches largely do not apply to these companies. We also believe that our relationship-based approach to investing helps us to assess and manage investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our debt investments in portfolio companies.
Competitive Advantages
 We believe we are well positioned to address the market for growth lending in a manner that will result in a competitive advantage over other established sponsored growth lenders. We believe our competitive strengths and key differentiators include:
 Experienced, Proven Management Team Supported by a Deep Bench of Dedicated Investment Professionals
The senior investment professionals of RGC have over 30 years of experience as venture capitalists and lenders who have developed a disciplined, repeatable approach to investing and managing investments in high potential growth businesses. We believe that the experience, relationships and disciplined investment and risk management processes of RGC’s investment professionals are a competitive advantage for us.
 Our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Spreng, who is also the founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of RGC, has a unique combination of experience as a senior executive of a $20 billion asset management firm and over 30 years as a venture capital equity and debt investor. Mr. Spreng has been a leader in applying risk management processes to investing in equity and debt of small, fast-growing, private companies. Our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officers, Treasurer and Secretary, Thomas Raterman, who is also Chief Financial Officer of RGC, has more than 30 years of corporate finance, investment banking, private equity and financial executive management experience with rapidly growing entrepreneurial companies. Greg Greifeld, Managing Director, Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Head of Credit at RGC, has over 13 years of lending, venture capital, and investment management experience.
RGC has a broad team of professionals focused on every aspect of the investment life cycle. RGC has origination, underwriting and portfolio monitoring teams that manage and oversee the investment process from identification of investment opportunity through negotiations of final term sheet and investment in a portfolio company followed by active portfolio monitoring. The team members serving investment management and oversight functions have significant operating experience and are not associated with origination functions to avoid any biased views of performance. This structure helps originators focus on identifying investment opportunities while other team members continue building relationships with our portfolio companies.
 Provide Capital to Robust, High-Growth Venture-backed Companies
We believe we are favorably positioned within the venture lending ecosystem, targeting primarily growth focused technology and life sciences companies. We believe the technology and life sciences industries are among the most attractive industries within the venture lending space, primarily representing large, addressable markets with strong and consistent growth. According to the Q4 2022 Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor and Pitchbook-NVCA industry classifications, venture capital deal volume for technology totaled approximately $203.6 billion in 2022, representing an 18.1% CAGR from 2012 to 2022. Venture capital deal volume for life sciences totaled approximately $42.1 billion in 2022, representing a 14.5% CAGR from 2012 to 2022. We believe companies within these industries can often be characterized as having asset-light business models, attractive recurring revenue streams and strong growth trajectories.

We invest across industries to diversify risk and deliver more stable returns. The investment professionals at RGC have extensive experience investing in the industries on which we focus, including technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services, select consumer services and products and other high-growth industries. Our ability to invest across diverse industries is supported by our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy and relationships with leading venture firms, who are generally industry experts in the areas in which they invest. We are able to leverage our relationships across equity providers, lenders, and advisers to source deals within the venture industry.
 We believe we are able to access opportunities to finance companies that are both backed by venture capital sponsors as well as through direct lead generation and other relationships. While many growth lenders focus solely on sponsored lending, we believe we are differentiated in our approach by offering both sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending that are secured by the assets of many of the most dynamic, innovative and fastest growing companies in the United States.
 Robust Disciplined Investment Process and Credit Analysis
RGC’s senior investment professionals draw upon their substantial experience, including operating, lending, venture capital and growth investing, to manage the underwriting investment process. Credit analysis, which is a fundamental part of our investment process, is driven by our credit-first philosophy and utilizes the core competencies the team has developed. A strong assessment of underwriting transactions often enables development of structure and pricing terms to win deals and produce strong returns for risks taken versus other lenders that take a more formulaic approach to the business.
 We believe the focused and disciplined approach that RGC applies to our lending strategy enables us to deliver strong, consistent returns to our investors. Our debt portfolio is 98.8% first lien senior secured. Of our $2.3 billion total commitments since inception, our cumulative gross loss rate, as a percentage of total commitments since inception, has been 0.66% and our net losses, as a percentage of total commitments since inception, has been 0.00%. At the point of origination, our portfolio companies have raised on average $108.9 million of equity proceeds relative to our average loan size of $26.9 million. To achieve this, we do not follow an "index" strategy or a narrowly focused approach, and we do not lend only to those companies that are backed by a specific set of sponsors. We believe that careful selection among many opportunities will yield the optimal portfolio results within both sponsored and non-sponsored lending opportunities - although we do expect the sponsored segment to represent the majority of the portfolio for foreseeable future.
 We maintain rigorous underwriting, monitoring and risk management processes across our portfolio, which is underpinned by our two main lending principles, first the ability to price risk and second the ability to measure and track enterprise value. Our investment process differs from many of our competitors in that we have a dedicated credit team, separate from the origination team, that manages the underwriting process. Unlike many of our competitors, we underwrite the company and the loan separately and spend significant time analyzing the enterprise value of the company and potential upside from the equity component of the transaction.
 Proprietary Risk Analytics and Return Optimization.
Over the past 20 years, RGC’s senior investment professionals have iterated upon and built out an extensive due diligence process, which has resulted in the proprietary risk analysis used today. Mr. Spreng has overseen the development of a risk management model that helps to identify, analyze and mitigate risk within individual portfolio companies in the venture capital space. The model utilized by us today examines a consistent set of more than 30 quantitative and qualitative variables in four main risk areas (market, technology, management and financing) to generate a composite risk ranking for each portfolio company.
 Flexible, Opportunity-Specific Pricing and Structure
RGC’s comprehensive analysis assesses all factors and does not rely on any one criterion above or more than others. For example, we do not seek to provide financing to every early-stage company backed by top-tier venture firms, but only to those companies that, in our opinion, possess the most favorable risk and return characteristics for our investments. We seek to understand the attractiveness of each opportunity on its own merits. The quality of the venture investors involved is important, but it is only one component of our decision-making process. Within our Non-Sponsored Growth Lending strategy, we expect that many companies will have positive EBITDA but have been unable to access sufficient capital to fund current growth opportunities. We believe that gaining a comprehensive picture of an opportunity based on RGC’s defined assessment factors allows us to be more flexible, to identify price and structure inefficiencies in the debt market, better support our portfolio companies, and to maximize loan and warrant returns, while minimizing losses. In our Sponsored and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending strategies, we target our loan to be less than 25% of enterprise value at inception.

Strong Reputation and Deep Relationships
RGC’s senior investment professionals enjoy reputations as innovative thought leaders, ingrained in the fabric of the venture community. RGC’s senior investment professionals have been active in venture capital investing, private lending, growth equity investing, corporate finance, and investment banking for more than 25 years and are viewed as trustworthy partners to both management and venture investors as well as entrepreneurs. Our investment professionals’ experience has often encouraged private companies to work with a lender that can manage challenges and deviations from plans that often arise in developing companies.
 RGC’s senior investment professionals also have established a network of relationships with various venture capital firms, venture banks, institutional investors, entrepreneurs and other venture capital market participants, which has allowed RGC to develop a variety of channels for investment originations and referrals. These investment professionals maintain ongoing dialogue with a number of venture capital firms across the country, leverage a suite of technologies to identify potential borrowers and often seek to be the first contact for new investment opportunities.
 In addition, our strategic relationship with Oaktree provides us with access to additional resources and relationships that are incremental to our already broad network of venture backed companies and venture capital sponsors.
 Competition
 Our primary competitors for investments include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, venture-oriented commercial banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC. We do not compete primarily on the financing terms we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable to or lower than our rates. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and we may not be able to compete effectively." in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K.
Staffing
 We do not currently have any employees. R. David Spreng, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, is also the founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of RGC. Thomas B. Raterman is our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary, and serves as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of RGC. Our Chief Financial Officer performs his functions for us under the terms of our Administration Agreement. We have also retained Colleen Corwell of ACA Group to serve as our Chief Compliance Officer pursuant to an agreement with ACA Group. Ms. Corwell also serves as the Chief Compliance Officer for RGC.
 Our day-to-day investment and administrative operations are managed by RGC and our Administrator. The Investment Committee is supported by a team of additional experienced investment professionals. RGC and our Administrator may hire additional investment and administrative professionals in the future to provide services to us, based upon our needs.
 In addition, we reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our internal control assessment under Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act").
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 We currently are, and expect to remain, an "emerging growth company," as that term is used in the JOBS Act until the earliest of:
 •the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO, which occurred on October 25, 2021;

•the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are equal to or greater than $1.07 billion;
 •the date on which we have, during the preceding three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and
 •the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b‑2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30.
 Under the JOBS Act, we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock."
 Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code and the regulations of the U.S. Department of Treasury promulgated thereunder, or "Treasury regulations," each as in effect as of the date of this Form 10‑K.
 These provisions are subject to differing interpretations and change by legislative or administrative action, and any change may be retroactive. This discussion does not constitute a detailed explanation of all U.S. federal income tax aspects affecting us and our stockholders and does not purport to deal with the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be important to particular stockholders in light of their individual investment circumstances or to some types of stockholders subject to special tax rules, such as financial institutions, broker dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, partnerships or other pass-through entities, persons holding our common stock in connection with a hedging, straddle, conversion or other integrated transaction, non-U.S. stockholders (as defined below) engaged in a trade or business in the United States, persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or to be taxed as resident aliens or individual non-U.S. stockholders present in the United States for 183 days or more during a taxable year. This discussion also does not address any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. This discussion assumes that our stockholders hold their shares of our common stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, assets held for investment). No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding any matter discussed herein.
 A "U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 •an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 •a corporation (or another entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 •an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 
 •a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
 A "non-U.S. stockholder" means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes neither a U.S. stockholder nor partnership.
 If a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our shares, the U.S. tax treatment of the partnership and each partner generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. A partnership considering an investment in our common stock should consult its own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares by the partnership.

Taxation of the Company
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and currently qualify and intend to continue to qualify for treatment as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends.
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things:
 •meet the Annual Distribution Requirement (defined below);
 •derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a "qualified publicly traded partnership," or "QPTP," hereinafter the "90% Gross Income Test;" and
 •diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year;
 •at least 50% of the value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other RICs and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and
 •not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other RICs), the securities of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs), or the securities of one or more QPTPs, or the "Diversification Tests."
 In the case of a RIC that furnishes capital to development corporations, there is an exception relating to the Diversification Tests described above. This exception is available only to RICs which the SEC determines to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available ("SEC Certification"). We have not sought SEC Certification, but it is possible that we may seek SEC Certification in future years. If we receive SEC Certification, we generally will be entitled to include, in the computation of the 50% value of our assets (described above), the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not we own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, if the basis of the securities, when added to our basis of any other securities of the issuer that we own, does not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.
 As a RIC, we must distribute an amount equal to at least the sum of (i) 90% of our investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net realized short-term capital gains over net realized long-term capital losses and other taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid and (ii) 90% of our net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), or the "Annual Distribution Requirement." We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. Generally, if we fail to meet this Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will fail to qualify as a RIC for such taxable year. To the extent we meet the Annual Distribution Requirement for a taxable year, but retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such retained capital gains and investment company taxable income. We may choose to retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated U.S. federal income tax, including any nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax described below, if applicable.
 We are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, unless we timely distribute (or are deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of:
 •at least 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;
 •at least 98.2% of our capital gain net income for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and
 •any net ordinary income and capital gain net income that we recognized for preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.

While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in order to avoid imposition of this nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while any senior securities are outstanding unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios. See "— Regulation as a Business Development Company — Senior Securities." Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its "investment company taxable income" (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may, for tax purposes, have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, stockholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would have received in the absence of such transactions.
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 While we have elected to be treated as a RIC and intend to qualify to be treated as a RIC annually, no assurance can be provided that we will qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for any taxable year. If we fail to satisfy the 90% Gross Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates or to dispose of certain assets). If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, may qualify as qualified dividends that are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 20% to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital that would reduce the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in its common stock (and correspondingly increase such stockholder's gain, or reduce such stockholder's loss, on disposition of such common stock), and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.
To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
 The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC for each taxable year.
 Company Investments
 Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (iii) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize
income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% Gross Income Test. We monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and to prevent disqualification of us as a RIC but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard.
 Debt Instruments.  In certain circumstances, we may be required to recognize taxable income prior to the time at which we receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with an end-of-term payment and/or payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest payment or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
 Warrants.  Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally are treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term generally depends on how long we held a particular warrant and on the nature of the disposition transaction.
 Foreign Investments.  In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the requirement to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.
 Passive Foreign Investment Companies.  We may invest in the stock of a foreign corporation which is classified as a "passive foreign investment company" (within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code), or "PFIC." As a result, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any "excess distribution" or gain from the disposition of such shares. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. This additional tax and interest may apply even if we make a distribution in an amount equal to any "excess distribution" or gain from the disposition of such shares as a taxable dividend by us to our shareholders. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a "qualified electing fund" under the Code (a "QEF"), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to us. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. No assurances can be given that any such election will be available or that, if available, we will make such an election.
Controlled Foreign Corporations. If we hold more than 10% of the shares in a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation, or "CFC," we may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each year from such foreign corporation in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation’s income for the tax year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains), whether or not the corporation makes an actual distribution during such year. In general, a foreign corporation will be classified as a CFC if more than 50% of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, is owned (directly, indirectly or by attribution) by U.S. shareholders. A "U.S. shareholder," for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses (actually or constructively) 10% or more of the combined voting power or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of shares of a corporation. If we are treated as receiving a deemed distribution from a CFC, we will be required to include such distribution in our investment company taxable income regardless of whether we receive any actual distributions from such CFC, and we must distribute such income to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and will the income be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax.
 Income inclusions from a QEF or CFC will be "good income" for purposes of the 90% Gross Income Test provided that they are derived in connection with our business of investing in stocks and securities or the QEF or CFC distributes such income to us in the same taxable year to which the income is included in our income.

Foreign Currency Transactions.  Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time we accrue income or other receivables or accrue expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such receivables or pay such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, on disposition of debt instruments and certain other instruments denominated in a foreign currency, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations if the value of the foreign currency between the date of acquisition of the instrument and the date of disposition also are treated as ordinary gain or loss. These currency fluctuations related gains and losses may increase or decrease the amount of our investment company taxable income to be distributed to our stockholders as ordinary income.
 Regulation as a Business Development Company
 General
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately-owned companies.
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
 As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. However, the 1940 Act has been modified to allow a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150% if certain requirements are met. We are permitted to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, at an annual or special meeting at which quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive such stockholder approval, we would be permitted to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, we may increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% if the "required majority" of our independent directors as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act approve such increase, with such approval becoming effective after one year. On October 28, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a proposal that permits us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150%. On June 16, 2022, our stockholders approved the reduced asset coverage ratio at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. The reduced asset coverage ratio of 150% became effective upon receiving stockholder approval.
 We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, RGC or our respective affiliates and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.

We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company (as defined in the 1940 Act), invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company, or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. The SEC rules permit us to exceed these limits without obtaining exemptive relief if we comply with certain conditions. If we invest in securities issued by investment companies, if any, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses as they will be indirectly responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our election to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our intention to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
 In addition, investment companies registered under the 1940 Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of "investment company" pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the 1940 Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions.
 We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage." in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
 As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which RGC or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with our investment adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. On August 10, 2020, we, RGC, and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by RGC were granted the Order that permits us greater flexibility than the 1940 Act permits to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our Board of Directors determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by RGC or its affiliates in a manner consistent with the our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that the ability to co-invest with similar investment structures and accounts sponsored or managed by RGC or its affiliates will provide additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Under the terms of the Order, a majority of our independent directors are required to make certain determinations in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors.
 On August 30, 2022, we received an amendment to our existing Order to permit us to, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds even if such other funds had not previously invested in such existing portfolio company. Without this order, such affiliated funds that are private funds would not be able to participate in such co-investments with us unless the affiliated funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with us.
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K.

 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
 (1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
 (a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
 (b)is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
 (c)satisfies any of the following:
 (i)does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
 (ii)has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250.0 million;
 (iii)is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
 (iv)is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.
 (2)Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
 (3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
 (4)Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the Company already owns 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
 (5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
 (6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
 In addition, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company but may exist in other circumstances based on the facts and circumstances. The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. The Company may adjust its investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative, or judicial actions.
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above in Qualifying Assets categories (1), (2) or (3). However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above in Qualifying Assets category (1)(c)(iv)) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management,
operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. We may also receive fees for these services. RGC may provide, or arrange for the provision of, such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance, subject to reimbursement of any fees or expenses incurred on our behalf by RGC in accordance with our Advisory Agreement.
Temporary Investments
 Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury Bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. RGC monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Warrants
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the issuance, terms and number of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and the Board of Directors approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in our best interests and the stockholders best interests and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options, or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio
 We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, the 1940 Act has been modified to allow a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. We are permitted to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, at an annual or special meeting at which quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive such stockholder approval, we are permitted to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, we may increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% if the "required majority" of our independent directors as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act approve such increase, with such approval becoming effective after one year. On October 28, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a proposal that permits us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150%. On June 16, 2022, our stockholders approved the reduced asset coverage ratio at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. The reduced asset coverage ratio of 150% became effective upon receiving stockholder approval.
In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We may borrow money, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us." in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
 We and RGC have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Colleen Corwell currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 •pursuant to Rule 13a‑14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
 •pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
 •pursuant to Rule 13a‑15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and, starting from the date on which we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm should we become an accelerated filer; and
 •pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a‑15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to RGC. The proxy voting policies and procedures of RGC are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by RGC and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, "we," "our" and "us" refers to RGC.
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, RGC has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, RGC recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner, free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients.
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for RGC's investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)‑6 under, the Advisers Act.
 Proxy Policies
 RGC will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of its clients’ stockholders. RGC will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although RGC will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, RGC may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
 RGC's proxy-voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, RGC will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its management any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how RGC intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.

Proxy Voting Records
 You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Runway Growth Capital LLC, 205 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 4200, Chicago, IL 60601.
