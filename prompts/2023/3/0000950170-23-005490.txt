General Developments
 2022 Year in Review
 With a volatile macroeconomic backdrop throughout 2022, we leveraged our investments in our products and services to drive revenue growth while also taking actions to address our operating costs and to be more efficient. We experienced broad-based revenue growth across all our vertical markets including Real Estate, Homeowners Associations ("HOAs"), Construction, Financial Services, and Media Advertising, as well as Emerging, which includes Education, Healthcare, and Social Services.
 We introduced new Application Programming Interface (“API”) integrations with AppFolio, Accumatica, Blackbaud Financial Edge NXT®, and QuickBooks Online and entered into new partnerships with Resman and Member Driven Technologies. We launched our AvidXchange “cross border payment” offering at NetSuite’s annual SuiteWorld user conference in Las Vegas, launched our Straight-Through-Process Supplier Offering, and launched our next generation Procurement and Purchase Order Management tools, which include three-way invoice matching capability. We also held our first in-person annual Customer Advisory Board meeting since 2019 (due to Covid) in Charlotte, NC with a group of our most influential customers.
 Actions taken to address our operating costs and to be more efficient included the completion of the migration of our infrastructure and hosting from a private cloud to Microsoft’s Azure public cloud, the implementation and completion of a reorganization of our workforce during the third quarter of 2022, the consolidation and repurposing of leased office space within our real estate portfolio, and the entrance into our new Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent (the “2022 Credit Agreement,” as fully defined below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Credit Facilities”), that replaced in its entirety the legacy 2019 Credit Agreement (as defined below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Credit Facilities”).
 We also recognized the first anniversary of our IPO during the fourth quarter of 2022.
Impact of Macroeconomic Events
 Throughout 2022, we have continued to see the impact of several macroeconomic events on our business and on our buyers and suppliers. These events have included, but are not limited to, the continuing global COVID-19 pandemic including the emergence of new variants, general economic conditions including inflation, fears of a possible recession, ongoing supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions including those resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While we continue to be encouraged by leading indicators in our sales process, the ongoing uncertainty created by these macroeconomic events could continue to have a negative impact on purchasing decisions by certain buyers, new sales and longer sales cycles. These events have made it and may continue to make it more difficult for us to acquire new buyers and to close new sales opportunities which in turn adversely impacts revenue growth in future periods.
 The U.S. economy is also currently experiencing a higher than normal level of inflation. The long-term impacts of inflation on the economy and our business remain unclear. On the one hand, our revenue could be positively impacted by inflation as the value of our customer's payments could rise, increasing our payment volume and the base on which we earn interchange revenue. Also, inflationary pressure could be a catalyst for sales acceleration associated with increased interest by potential customers in automating back-office processing. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in an effort to reduce inflation. These rate increases have in turn increased the interest we earn on funds held for buyers, which we recognize as payment revenue. Conversely, the impact of inflationary pressures on the macro economy could slow the spending of our customers and decrease payment volume. Inflation could also negatively impact our operating costs by increasing costs incurred by us to operate our business due to higher costs from our vendors and increased personnel costs, some of which we may not be able to recoup from our customers. The impact of inflation on our business and on our buyers and suppliers in future periods remains highly uncertain, as does the Federal Reserve’s response to these conditions. We may not see these impacts of inflation in future periods, which could lead to difficulty in comparing our current consolidated financial results to our results in future reporting periods.
 Description of Business
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of accounts payable ("AP") automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses

and their suppliers. Our Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") based, end-to-end software and payment platform digitizes and automates the AP workflows for more than 8,800 businesses (our buyers) and we have made payments to more than 965,000 supplier customers of our buyers (suppliers) over the past five years. While acquiring new and retaining existing relationships with buyers and suppliers are important to our business, the growth of our business is ultimately dependent upon the number of transactions we process, as well as our total payment volume. We developed our technology platform through years of working to solve our buyers’ unique middle market workflow challenges. We define middle market businesses primarily as companies with between $5 million and $1 billion in annual revenue. Middle market businesses are challenged by their high invoice throughput and complex AP workflows, while they also operate at a small enough scale such that complicated enterprise solutions are cost prohibitive and difficult to implement. Leveraging our domain expertise, we purpose-built a two-sided network that connects buyers and suppliers, drives digital transformation, increases efficiency and accuracy in AP workflows, accelerates payments, enables insight into critical analytics, and lowers operating costs for our buyers.
 By integrating with our customers’ middle market oriented accounting and information systems, our platform automates the end-to-end AP workflows for our buyers and enhances the payment experience for our suppliers through the following products and features:
 •AP Automation Software. We have developed a SaaS-based solution automating and digitizing the capture, review, approval and payment of invoices for our buyers. We digitally capture invoices from suppliers and apply the buyer’s specific business rules to enable them to begin processing the invoice, extract and utilize transaction data from the invoice to enhance and configure the approval workflows, and manage the entire AP process through the payment of the invoice.
 •The AvidPay Network. Our two-sided payments network connects our buyers with their suppliers, enabling invoice payments on behalf of a buyer and according to the supplier’s business rules, payment preferences and remittance data. We support a variety of payment methods depending on the supplier’s preference, including virtual credit card ("VCC"), enhanced automated clearing house ("ACH") (our AvidPay Direct) and physical check, while delivering enhanced remittance data to streamline the reconciliation process.
 •Cashflow Manager. We provide cash management solutions to our supplier network, including tools that provide custom views of invoices and an accelerator feature (our Invoice Accelerator). These additional features, and others in our product pipeline, allow us to both monetize and increase engagement on our two-sided payments network.
 We do not have significant customer concentration in our business, with no single customer contributing more than 5% of 2022 revenue and with our top 10 customers contributing less than 10% of revenue in 2022. Our customers operate across a variety of verticals in which we have domain expertise, including real estate, HOAs, construction, financial services (including banks and credit unions), healthcare facilities, social services, education, and media. Certain segments of our customers, particularly the customers we acquired through the FastPay acquisition that focus on political advertising within our media vertical, are subject to seasonal and cyclical trends. In 2022, we processed approximately 70 million transactions representing over $215 billion in spend under management across our platform and, of that spend, we moved $68 billion in total payment volume from our buyers to their suppliers. Spend under management represents the sum of (i) the aggregate dollar amount of payments processed by us, plus (ii) the aggregate dollar amount represented by the total number of invoices processed by us, in each case, during the specified period. As described in more detail in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we generate revenue from each transaction processed on a per transaction basis and earn interchange revenue from a portion of the total payment volume.
 Our Market Opportunity
 The business-to-business ("B2B") payments market is evolving and represents an opportunity for digital transformation.
We believe that manual invoice payments processes, with their cost inefficiencies, lack of scalability, inability to accommodate remote work, and susceptibility to fraud present an opportunity for our business.
 In addition to providing B2B payments, we believe we can team with our suppliers’ finance organizations to better manage expenses and cash flow. We believe that there is an unmet need in supplier invoice finance. Our solutions help suppliers accelerate invoices for early payment, manage supplier payment preferences, and forecast future cash flows.
Go-To-Market
 We sell our solutions through a hybrid go-to-market strategy that includes direct and indirect channels. Our direct sales force leverages their domain expertise in select verticals and over 205 referral relationships with integrated software providers, financial institutions and other partners to identify and attract buyers that would benefit from our AP software solutions and the AvidPay

Network. Our indirect channel includes reseller partners and other strategic partnerships with banks and financial institutions such as our partnerships with Mastercard, through MasterCard’s B2B Hub, which includes Fifth Third Bank and Bank of America, other financial institutions, such as KeyBank, third-party software providers, and technology business partners such as MRI Software, RealPage and SAP Concur. Our referral and indirect channel partnerships provide us greater reach across the market to access a variety of buyers.
Our go-to-market team is core to our growth and continues to evolve with the evolving market and our own internal development of products. We continuously monitor key metrics that measure our sales team and channel sales success, productivity, and efficiency. We maintain long-term customer satisfaction through our relationship management and customer care organization, who provide customer support through multiple avenues of communication including email, phone, chat, and forums.
 Our marketing is focused on our ability to serve the middle market, our end-to-end solutions, the value we provide to our customers, and our continued product innovation. Our targeted marketing to the middle market includes both digital and traditional brand campaigns, targeted advertisements, social, thought leadership pieces, trade shows, and webinars.
 We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities to capitalize on our market opportunity.
 Why We Win
 We believe we have several competitive advantages that drive our ability to leverage our first mover market position:
 •Built to solve the unique business challenges of the middle market. Since our inception, our solution has been purpose-built for the middle market. Our platform addresses enterprise level challenges, but at the scale, price and in the language of the middle market.
 •Digitize the entire AP workflow. We apply data and SaaS-based software automation to the entirety of the AP workflow and focus on transforming the buyer experience by owning, and enhancing each point of the value chain. Our platform will handle invoice ingestion, whether through paper or electronic means, and replicate that ownership and automation through to payment.
 •Comprehensive, end-to-end AP Automation and payments platform. Our solution provides a single-vendor approach to eliminate paper, streamline workflows and ensure timely and accurate reconciliations and payments. We have spent years building a software and payments platform coupled with hundreds of integrations to vertical-specific middle market accounting and information systems.
 •Scaled, two-sided network of buyers and suppliers powers a flywheel effect. We provide the infrastructure layer connecting our buyers with their suppliers. As buyers approve and pay more invoices through our platform, we connect them to their suppliers and add more suppliers to our network, which drives an expansion of the flywheel effect that fuels our growth. As a result of this ongoing flywheel, we have built a high level of supplier density that allows us to monetize payments almost immediately after a buyer joins our platform.





•Diverse and deep integration layer. We offer more than 225 integrations with different accounting systems that allow our clients to curate a technology stack tailored to the nuances of their size, scale and vertical. Our “built inside” integrations, many of which are flexible API based integrations, facilitate exchanges of data, driving enhanced user experiences and utility and providing a feature set and level of customization historically reserved only for enterprises.
 •Unparalleled data capabilities. Our buyers and suppliers benefit from the millions of invoices we have ingested and processed since inception. From the beginning, we recognized the feedback value of data and as such our product development and operations benefit from two decades of transactions. We believe we ingest invoices more accurately, manage risk more insightfully and assess credit more thoughtfully in part due to a knowledge base that continues to grow every day.
 Growth Strategy
 Fundamentally, the growth of our business is dependent upon the number of transactions we process, as well as our total payment volume. Key elements of our growth strategy include the following.
 •Win new buyers and their suppliers. We believe the middle market opportunity remains largely underpenetrated. As the number of middle market companies continues to increase and their AP and payment complexity grows, we anticipate demand for our products by new customers to increase. We will continue to invest in our direct and indirect sales channels to increase awareness of our platform, drive sales opportunities, and convert more of our pipeline into customers. We will also continue to grow and scale the number of strategic partnerships we have, providing more opportunities to acquire new customers from our software and bank channels as well as our referral partnerships.


•Grow with existing buyers and suppliers. We expect to continue to grow with our existing buyer base of over 8,800 businesses. As our buyer base continues to grow and mature, we expect them to continue to increase invoice and payment transaction volume across the AvidXchange platform. In addition, we plan to continue to cross-sell solutions to our existing buyers.
 •Increase conversion of paper checks to electronic payments. As our buyers continue to mature and increase their overall payment transaction volume, we believe there is an opportunity to increase the penetration of electronic payments. As additional buyers and suppliers join our proprietary AvidPay Network, we will continue to build functionality and drive conversion of manual to electronic payments. Our growing supplier density will continue to drive higher monetization rates leading to increased e-payment adoption.
 •Continue to innovate and enhance new products. We will continue leveraging the data and business insights we have accumulated across buyer and supplier transactions to add new innovations and capabilities. Our goal is to create more end-to-end solutions that integrate purchasing and payments workflows. In addition to enhancing products for our buyer customers, we will also continue to use our access to data to build out more offerings for suppliers, including financing solutions. 
 •Selectively pursue strategic M&A. We plan to supplement our organic growth by pursuing strategic M&A with an intent to expand into new verticals and horizontal capabilities, capture unmonetized or under-monetized spend, and enhance and expand products and capabilities. We have a track record of acquiring and executing M&A to drive revenue growth, efficiency leverage, and scalability across the organization.
 •Enter new verticals. We believe there is untapped opportunity in the middle market to expand into new and adjacent verticals. We intend to invest in our vertical sales teams across different geographies, execute in-house development to build vertical domain capabilities, increase our number of bank and software partnerships, and expand the number of next-generation API and “built inside” integrations. 
 •International expansion. We may in the future expand internationally with an initial focus on Canada and possibly the United Kingdom, and Europe thereafter. We would likely leverage our existing business partner relationships we have already in place in the United States to build our presence worldwide.
 Human Capital, Culture, Social Responsibility and Community Initiatives
 At AvidXchange, our employees are the core of who we are. In 2022 and beyond, we celebrate our employees and they have recognized our efforts:
 •We have launched the AvidXchange Sabbatical program. Teammates with 10+ years of continued service at AvidXchange can apply to take four weeks of consecutive time away from work outside of other policies and paid time off.
 •We also celebrate tenure through our V-Crew and X-Crew recognition programs. The V-Crew is defined as teammates who have been with AvidXchange for 5+ years. As of 2022, nearly 30% of AvidXchange teammates belong to the V-Crew, and on an annual basis, V-Crew teammates receive a customized V-Crew Award, and Michael Praeger, our Chief Executive Officer and Founder, invites V-Crew teammates to celebrate this milestone with a dinner in their honor. We have extended this recognition to teammates who have been with AvidXchange for 10+ years with our recent creation of the X-Crew.
 •AvidXcellence is our AvidXchange Annual Company-Wide Recognition Program. This program recognizes and rewards the highest performing teammates across the Company. Our highest performing teammates are those who consistently demonstrate exceptional results and are exemplary of our AvidDNA (our culture). 
 •With 84 percent of our teammates saying “AvidXchange is a Great Place to Work,” we earned a Top Certification by Great Place to Work®. Great Place to Work® is a global authority on workplace culture, employee experience, and the leadership behaviors proven to deliver market-leading revenue, employee retention and increased innovation. The award is based entirely on what current employees say about their experience working at AvidXchange via a generated survey. AvidXchange overall received high marks from employees on camaraderie and respect; 94 percent of respondents said when you join the Company, you are made to feel welcome.
 While we are a technology company by trade, at our core, we are a people company, and that means not only taking care of each other, but those in the communities in which we work and live.
•We enable our employees who are passionate about giving back to the community, in whatever way is most meaningful to them, with paid volunteer time off. We understand that engaging with our communities and striving to improve the quality of life for our employees and neighbors is an opportunity and a responsibility.


•We are committed to sharing our resources and time in support of philanthropic efforts. In demonstration of this commitment, on June 24, 2021, our board of directors approved the reservation of 1,657,296 shares of our common stock (representing approximately 1% of our issued and outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents as of June 24, 2021) for future issuance to fund our philanthropic endeavors over a ten-year period, including the potential issuance to a philanthropic partner in connection with the establishment of a donor-advised fund. On October 1, 2021, we executed an agreement with a philanthropic partner to whom we intend to provide annual ongoing grants of 10% of the pledged shares for a period of nine subsequent years, subject in each case to the approval of our board of directors. The latest tranche of our pledge was authorized by our board of directors in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 •We believe in diversity, inclusion and belonging (“DI&B”) and we expect that every employee continues to grow in their engagement journey with DI&B. We create and facilitate experiences for every employee through initiatives and programming currently focused on 8 meet-up groups that foster regular and meaningful exchanges: AAPI - Asian-American and Pacific Islander, AvidPride, BLAC - Black Leadership Alliance Council, DCI – Disability and Chronic Illness, The LatinXers, Parents and Caregivers, Veterans, and Women.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had over 1,600 full-time, U.S. based employees. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 We assess several human capital indicators which are measured regularly, shared monthly among the management team, and factored into our bonus compensation program: Monthly Teammate Engagement Score, Regretted Attrition, and Quality of Hire. We believe that these metrics provide objective assessments on our recruiting, development, and retention efforts by tracking the quality and outcomes of our recruiting efforts, the level of employee satisfaction, and the impacts of our culture initiatives.
 Our Monthly Teammate Engagement Score is based on a 20-question survey delivered monthly via a 5-question pulse survey with scores aggregated every 4 months. With 100 out of 100 being a perfect score, our Monthly Teammate Engagement Score was 82 out of 100 at the beginning of 2022 and we ended the year at an 86 out of 100. External benchmarking considers a Teammate Engagement Score of between 83 and 100 to reflect strongly engaged teammates. We believe that strongly engaged teammates are more closely connected to the business, are brand advocates, strive to achieve goals, and have higher retention.
 Regretted Attrition represents the annualized number of attritted, regretted teammates over all teammates. Regretted Attrition ended 2022 at 4.3%. We believe that our Regretted Attrition is below external benchmarks and that this score reflects our focus on keeping top talent and the strength of our culture initiatives.
 Our Quality of Hire metric measures the percentage of teammates who left the company within their first year of employment. We ended 2022 with a score of 9.29%. We believe that our score is below external benchmarks and reflects that our selection methodologies are aligned between candidate assessment and the role that is being filled.
 Our compensation plans and philosophy will be included in our 2023 Proxy Statement, and we intend to provide further disclosures regarding our environmental, social and governance efforts prior to our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
 Competition
 We believe the overall market for AP software and payments solutions is fragmented, competitive and evolving and is marked by rapid change and consolidation due to technological innovations and continued adoption by businesses. Although we expect businesses to continue to adopt AP and payment automation solutions, we often find that we are selling our products and services to potential customers that use a variety of legacy and internally developed solutions, policies, and procedures, and we must be able to convince internal stakeholders that our products and solutions are superior to their existing processes or third-party solutions.
 Our current competitors range from fintech companies, such as Bill.com and Coupa Software, and financial institutions to smaller, niche providers of software and services, as well as point solutions provided by enterprise resource planning ("ERP") vendors. We compete with companies that offer comprehensive solutions focused on the entire AP and payment processes and companies that focus only on select portions of these processes such as invoice and bill presentment, document and workflow management, AP and payment processing or accounts receivable. Solutions are also often specifically tailored to industry vertical or customer size making it difficult to expand into new verticals or attract larger or smaller customer types.
 Accounting and ERP software providers, financial institutions, payment processing, and other service providers, a number of which we partner with in offering our solutions, may currently offer or develop solutions, acquire third-party solutions or competitors, or enter into strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their solutions to compete more effectively with our products and services. These parties may have access to larger, installed customer bases and may be able to bundle and cross sell competitive solutions with their other services, which may enable them to compete more effectively or provide them with greater pricing and operating flexibility.


Companies that currently focus on providing solutions to enterprise businesses or small-to-medium businesses (“SMBs”) may seek to expand the offering of their solutions to middle market customers which would be more directly competitive with the products and services that we offer. New entrants not currently considered to be competitors may also enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships.
 We currently compete on several factors, including:
 •product and service features, functionality and quality and system stability;
 •integrations with leading accounting and banking systems;
 •our value added services provided through various strategic partnership;
 •pricing and incentives;
 •supplier network;
 •ability to automate existing processes; and
 •customer onboarding time and effort.
 
We believe that we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. We expect the middle market AP software and B2B payment solutions market to continue to evolve and grow, as greater numbers of middle market and larger businesses digitize their back offices. We believe that we are well-positioned to help them.
 Regulatory Environment
 We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied or in which new laws and regulations are implemented is often unclear and unpredictable, in particular as such laws and regulations relate to our business in the United States and internationally to the extent we might in the future elect to expand our services outside the United States.
 Most states and certain territories in the United States require a license to engage in certain money transmission or payment services. We have procured and maintain money transmitter licenses, or the statutory equivalent, in all of the U.S. jurisdictions that currently require them for our business and we actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. These licenses enable us to provide commercial payment services to businesses through AvidXchange, Inc. “for the benefit of customer” bank accounts that are restricted for such purposes and subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and examination by state regulatory agencies.
 We are also registered as a Money Services Business with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, and are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA"), and certain obligations contained therein, including, among other things, certain record-keeping and reporting requirements, and examinations by FinCEN.
 The BSA is the primary compendium of U.S. laws and regulations regarding anti-money laundering ("AML") and countering the financing of terrorism. As required under the BSA, we have implemented and are continuing to expand an AML program designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Our program is also designed to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries, or with certain persons or entities, which are targets of economic or trade sanctions that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the "OFAC") and various foreign authorities administer or enforce. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, require the designation of a BSA and AML compliance officer to oversee the programs, and are designed to address our legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with sanctions, compliance, money laundering, and terrorist financing.
 Although we do not provide consumer services or products, we do collect and use a wide variety of information for various purposes in our business, including to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. Our customers’ data is stored in our platform, and we must monitor and, as applicable, comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations regarding the data stored and processed on our platform as well as the operation of our business. This may present legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy or intellectual property rights related to the content loaded onto our platform.
 This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of the information we acquire in connection with our customers’ use of our services, may be subject to certain laws and regulations in the United States. In particular, data privacy and security with respect to the collection, processing, and retention of personal data or Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") continues to be the focus of domestic and worldwide legislation and regulation. In recent years, there have been a number

of well-publicized data breaches involving the unauthorized use and disclosure of individuals’ PII. Many U.S. states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of PII to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. Federal laws are also under consideration that may create additional compliance obligations and penalties. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information.
 In addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including within the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that are more restrictive than those in the United States. While we believe that the products and services that we currently offer in the United States do not subject us to such laws or regulations in foreign jurisdictions, such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, new laws and regulations may be enacted, or we may modify or expand our products or services in the future, or acquire a company operating internationally, which may subject us to such laws and regulations.
 Various regulatory agencies in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which may be applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing. As our business continues to develop and expand, we continue to monitor the additional rules and regulations that may become relevant or applicable to our business.
 Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of privacy and data use, under the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
 Cybersecurity
 As referenced above, in the normal course of business, we may collect and store certain sensitive Company information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party information and employee information, and certain personal information. To protect this information, our existing cybersecurity policies require monitoring and detection programs, network security measures, encryption of critical data, and security assessment of vendors. We maintain various protections designed to safeguard against cyberattacks, including firewalls and virus detection software. We have established and test our disaster recovery plan and we protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, perform annual penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. In addition, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.
 Our cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer. The program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information. Our cybersecurity leadership reports to the full board of directors and its audit and risk management committees quarterly on information security and cybersecurity matters, or as needed. For example, the risk committee in conjunction with management and our enterprise risk management team have developed a cybersecurity dashboard, that is updated and reviewed quarterly, with metrics that include detection, response, and recovery measures, security culture scores, and security incident trends. Our board of directors and its committees has oversight responsibility for our information security practices and we believe they collectively have the requisite experience, knowledge, inquisitiveness, and visibility into the design and operation of our information security practices to fulfill this responsibility effectively.
We have implemented policies, standards, and technical controls based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework with the aim of protecting our networks and applications, to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information entrusted to us. Our service providers and we, have security measures and programs in place to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber-attacks, security-related incidents, and other similar threats. However, our ability to monitor our vendors’ cybersecurity practices is limited, therefore we cannot guarantee that our measures and programs will prevent a cyber-incident impacting our systems or information.
 We continue to evaluate internal systems, process, and controls to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigate potential loss from cyber-attacks. The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational and fraud losses, and enhance our overall performance. In addition, we have invested, and plan to continue investing, in resources to protect our information security ecosystem against cyber-attacks, other security-related incidents, and data breaches and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
 Our cybersecurity program has also focused on companywide training on phishing and other social engineering attacks. Management takes the position cybersecurity is owned company wide as a collective team, not just by the organizations of the

Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer. Our new security awareness platform was deployed in the first quarter of 2022 to improve awareness through training and more realistic phishing campaigns. Monthly all-hands briefings, updates on metrics, and “tips and tricks” started in the fourth quarter of 2022 to focus on addressing gaps in awareness. Key areas of focus in 2023 will include requiring training for teammates that fail phishing campaigns and encouraging the reporting of phishing to improve resiliency.
 Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.
Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and business intelligence tools, enhancements to existing products and applications, and large-scale infrastructure projects that improve the underlying architecture of our technology. We make investments in our technology to maintain and enhance our position as a leading provider of AP automation software and payment solutions for middle market businesses and their suppliers. We leverage emerging technologies and invest in the development of features that meet and anticipate the needs of both buyers and suppliers.
Intellectual Property
 We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying upon a combination of contractual measures as well as trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws.
 We rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive position. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had several trademark applications and registrations for certain of our logos. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We also own several domain names, including www.avidxchange.com.
 Patents have not historically been a significant part of our intellectual property strategy. We may however pursue patent protection in the future to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
 From time to time we may also use or incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including under certain open-source licenses. Even if any such third-party technology was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed.
 Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
 We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third parties may also claim that our solutions infringe upon their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are large and established and have greater resources than we do. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time during which time we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. Moreover, our products may incorporate software components licensed to the general public under open-source software licenses. Open-source licenses may grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify, and redistribute our platform. As a result, open-source development and license practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets.
