Item 1. | Business

The Company

Essential Utilities, Inc. (formerly known as Aqua America, Inc.) (referred to as Essential Utilities, Essential, the Company, we, us, or our), a Pennsylvania corporation, is the holding company for regulated utilities providing water, wastewater, or natural gas services to an estimated five million people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, North Carolina, New Jersey, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky under the Aqua and Peoples brands. One of our largest operating subsidiaries, Aqua Pennsylvania, Inc., (Aqua Pennsylvania) accounted for approximately 56% of operating revenues and approximately 73% of income for our Regulated Water segment in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, Aqua Pennsylvania provided water or wastewater services to approximately one-half of the total number of water and wastewater customers we serve. Aqua Pennsylvania’s service territory is located in the suburban areas in counties north and west of the City of Philadelphia and in 27 other counties in Pennsylvania. Our other regulated water or wastewater utility subsidiaries provide similar services in seven additional states. Additionally, commencing on March 16, 2020 with the completion of the Peoples Gas Acquisition, the Company began to provide natural gas distribution services to customers in western Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Approximately 93% of the total number of natural gas utility customers we serve are in western Pennsylvania. The Company also operates non-regulated market-based activities that are supplementary and complementary to our regulated utility businesses. Aqua Resources offers, through a third-party, water and sewer line protection solutions and repair services to households. Other non-regulated subsidiaries of Peoples provide utility service line protection services to households and operate gas marketing and production businesses. 




For many years, starting in the early 1990s, our business strategy was primarily directed toward the regulated water and wastewater utility industry, where we have more than quadrupled the number of regulated customers we serve, and have extended our regulated operations from southeastern Pennsylvania to include our current regulated utility operations throughout Pennsylvania and in seven additional states. On March 16, 2020, we completed our acquisition of a natural gas distribution company consisting of Peoples Natural Gas Company LLC, Peoples Gas Company LLC, Peoples Gas WV LLC, Peoples Gas KY LLC, PNG Gathering LLC, and Delta Natural Gas Company Inc., expanding the Company’s regulated utility business to include natural gas distribution. This acquisition is referred to as the “Peoples Gas Acquisition,” and collectively these businesses are referred to as “Peoples.” Peoples serves approximately 750,000 gas utility customers in western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. During 2010 through 2013, we sold our utility operations in six states, pursuant to a portfolio rationalization strategy, to focus our operations in areas where we have critical mass and economic growth potential. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company signed an agreement to sell its regulated natural gas utility assets in West Virginia, which represent approximately two percent of the Company’s regulated natural gas customers. Currently, the Company seeks to acquire businesses in the U.S. regulated sector, which includes water and wastewater utilities and other regulated utilities, and to pursue growth ventures in market-based activities, such as infrastructure opportunities that are supplementary and complementary to our regulated utility businesses. 

The descriptions of our business and operations, financial results, and operational data included in this Annual Report do not include historical results for Peoples prior to the acquisition date of March 16, 2020.

The following table reports our operating revenues, by principal state, for our Regulated Water segment, which includes both water and wastewater utility services, Regulated Natural Gas segment, and Other and eliminations for the year ended December 31, 2022:

(2)Includes our natural gas operating subsidiaries in West Virginia and Kentucky.




The Company has identified twelve operating segments and has two reportable segments, the Regulated Water segment and the Regulated Natural Gas segment. The Regulated Water segment is comprised of eight operating segments for our water and wastewater regulated utility companies, aligned with the states where we provide these services. These operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment since each of the Company’s operating segments has the following similarities: economic characteristics, nature of services, production processes, customers, water distribution or wastewater collection methods, and the nature of the regulatory environment. The Regulated Natural Gas segment is comprised of one operating segment representing natural gas utility companies, acquired in the Peoples Gas Acquisition, for which the Company provides natural gas distribution services. In addition to the Company’s two reportable segments, the Company includes three of its operating segments in “Other”. These businesses represent our non-regulated water, wastewater, and natural gas operations, which are not quantitatively significant to be reportable and therefore are included as a component of “Other”. In addition, “Other” and eliminations include corporate costs that have not been allocated to the Regulated Water and Regulated Natural Gas segments, because they would not be recoverable as a cost of utility service, and intersegment eliminations. Information concerning revenues, net income, identifiable assets and related financial information for the Regulated Water and Regulated Natural Gas segments and Other and eliminations for 2022, 2021, and 2020, is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 18 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The following table summarizes our operating revenues, by utility customer class, for the Regulated Water and Regulated Natural Gas segments and Other and eliminations for the year ended December 31, 2022:

Customers

Our water utility customer base is diversified among residential water, commercial water, fire protection, industrial water, other water, wastewater customers, and other utility customers (consisting of contracted services that are associated with the utility operations). Residential water and wastewater customers make up the largest component of our water utility customer base, with these customers representing approximately 68%, 69%, and 71%, of our water and wastewater revenues for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Substantially all of our water utility customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption. Water consumption per customer is affected by local weather conditions during the year, especially during late spring, summer, and early fall. In general, during these seasons, an extended period of dry weather increases consumption, while above-average rainfall decreases consumption. Also, an increase in the average temperature generally causes an increase in water consumption. On occasion, abnormally dry weather in our service areas can result in governmental authorities declaring drought warnings and imposing water use restrictions in the affected areas, which could reduce water consumption. See “Business – Water Utility Supplies, and Facilities and Wastewater Utility Facilities” for a discussion of water use restrictions that may impact water consumption during abnormally dry weather. The geographic diversity of our water utility customer base reduces the effect of our exposure to extreme or unusual weather conditions in any one area of our service territories. Water usage is also affected by changing consumption patterns by our customers, resulting from such causes as increased water conservation and the installation of water saving devices and appliances that can result in decreased water usage. It is estimated that, in the event we experience a 0.50% decrease in residential water consumption, it would result in a decrease in annual residential water revenue of approximately $3,000,000, which would likely be partially offset by a reduction in incremental water production expenses such as chemicals and power.

Our natural gas utility customer base is diversified among residential gas, commercial gas, industrial gas, gas transportation, and other utility. Substantially all of our natural gas utility customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ natural gas usage. Natural gas usage per customer is affected by local weather conditions during the year, especially during the fall, winter, and early spring. These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months. Our regulated natural gas revenues and expenses are also affected by the cost of gas. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers using a purchased gas adjustment clause; therefore, fluctuations in the cost of purchased gas impact revenues on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Since regulated natural gas revenues are affected by the cost of gas, higher gas costs, as well as general economic conditions, may cause customers to conserve usage, or seek alternative energy sources. In addition, higher gas costs result in an increase to our purchased gas inventory, which requires additional borrowings under credit facilities, resulting in higher interest expense. 

The Company’s growth in revenues over the past five years is primarily a result of the 2020 Peoples Gas Acquisition, increases in water and wastewater rates, increase in the cost of natural gas in 2021 and 2022, and customer growth. See Economic Regulation for a discussion of water, wastewater, and natural gas rates. The increase in our utility customer base has been due to customers added through acquisitions, partnerships with developers, and organic growth (excluding dispositions) as shown below: 



Year | Utility Customer Growth Rate
2022 | 1.7% 
2021 | 1.2% 
2020 | 42.9% 
2019 | 2.1% 
2018 | 2.3% 


In 2022, 2021, and 2020, our customer count increased by 31,537, 21,246, and 772,099 customers, respectively, primarily due to the water and wastewater utility systems that we acquired, organic growth, and in 2020, due to the Peoples Gas Acquisition that resulted to the addition of approximately 750,000 natural gas utility customers. Overall, for the five year period of 2018 through 2022, our utility customer base, adjusted to exclude customers associated with utility system dispositions, increased at an annual compound rate of 13.5%. During the five year period ended December 31, 2022, our utility customer base including customers associated with utility system acquisitions and dispositions increased from 982,849 at January 1, 2018 to 1,851,586 at December 31, 2022. 




Acquisitions and Other Growth Ventures

We believe that acquisitions will continue to be an important source of customer growth for us. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of government-owned and regulated water and wastewater systems that provide services in areas near our existing service territories or in new service areas. We engage in continuing activities with respect to potential acquisitions, including calling on prospective sellers, performing analyses of and due diligence on acquisition candidates, making preliminary acquisition proposals, and negotiating the terms of potential acquisitions. Further, we are also seeking other potential business opportunities, including but not limited to, partnering with public and regulated utilities to invest in infrastructure projects, growing our market-based activities by acquiring businesses that provide water and wastewater or other utility-related services, and investing in infrastructure projects.

Based on the 2021 U.S. Census American Housing Survey, approximately 89% of the U.S. population obtains its water from public or private water utility systems, and 11% of the U.S. population obtains its water from individual wells. With approximately 50,000 public or private water systems in the U.S. (81% of which serve less than 3,300 customers), the water industry is the most fragmented of the major utility industries (telephone, natural gas, electric, water and wastewater). The majority of these community water systems are government-owned. The nation’s water systems range in size from large government-owned systems, such as the New York City water system, which serves approximately 8.8 million people, to small systems, where a few customers share a common well. In the states where we operate regulated water utilities, we believe there are approximately 14,000 public or private water utility systems of widely-varying size, with the majority of the population being served by government-owned water systems. 

Although not as fragmented as the water industry, the wastewater industry in the U.S. also presents opportunities for consolidation. Based on the 2021 U.S. Census American Housing Survey, approximately 84% of the U.S. population relies on public or private sewer systems, and 16% of the U.S. population relies on septic tank, cesspool or other sewer options. A majority of wastewater facilities are government-owned rather than regulated utilities. In the states where we operate regulated water utilities, we believe there are approximately 4,000 wastewater facilities in operation, with the majority of the population being served by government-owned wastewater systems. 

Because of the fragmented nature of the water and wastewater utility industries, we believe there are many potential water and wastewater system acquisition candidates throughout the U.S. We believe the factors driving consolidation of these systems are:

the benefits of economies of scale; 
the increasing cost and complexity of environmental regulations; 
the need for substantial capital investment;
the need for technical and managerial expertise;
the desire to improve water quality and service;
limited access to cost-effective financing; 
the monetizing of public assets to support, in some cases, the declining financial condition of municipalities; and
the use of system sale proceeds by a municipality to accomplish other public purposes. 

We are actively exploring opportunities to expand our utility operations through acquisitions or other growth ventures. During the five-year period ended December 31, 2022, we expanded our utility operations by completing 28 acquisitions of water or wastewater utilities or other similar assets. Additionally, in March 2020, we completed our acquisition of Peoples, which expanded the Company’s regulated utility business to include natural gas distribution. 

Supply and Facilities

Water Utility Supplies and Facilities and Wastewater Utility Facilities - Our water utility operations obtain their water supplies from surface water sources, underground aquifers, and water purchased from other water suppliers. Our water supplies are primarily self-supplied and processed at twenty-three surface water treatment plants located in five states, and numerous well stations located in the states in which we conduct business. Approximately 5.9% of our water supplies are provided through water purchased from other water suppliers. It is our policy to obtain and maintain the permits necessary to obtain and treat the water we distribute. 

 



In September 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Pennsylvania, and the Company had to temporarily shut down two of its water treatment plants, in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which had been damaged due to heavy rainfall, flooding and loss of power. These plants serve a significant portion of Aqua Pennsylvania’s service territory in southeastern Pennsylvania. The Company was able to maintain supply to most of its customers by ramping up production at some of its other treatment plants. However, due to low water pressure in some locations, Aqua Pennsylvania asked customers to adopt voluntary water conservation measures during a two-week period. The damage to the facilities occurred despite our prior efforts to shore up the facilities to prevent such floodwater occurrences. 

We believe that the capacities of our sources of supply, and our water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are generally sufficient to meet the present requirements of our customers under normal conditions. We plan system improvements and additions to capacity in response to normal replacement and renewal needs, changing regulatory standards, changing patterns of consumption, and increased demand from customer growth. The various state utility commissions have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting water and wastewater rates. 

On occasion, drought warnings and water use restrictions are issued by governmental authorities for portions of our service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions. The timing and duration of the warnings and restrictions can have an impact on our water revenues and net income. In general, water consumption in the summer months is more affected by drought warnings and restrictions because discretionary and recreational use of water is at its highest during the summer months. At other times of the year, warnings and restrictions generally have less of an effect on water consumption. Drought warnings and watches result in the public being asked to voluntarily reduce water consumption. 

We believe that our wastewater treatment facilities are generally adequate to meet the present requirements of our customers under normal conditions. Additionally, we own several wastewater collection systems that convey the wastewater to municipally-owned facilities for treatment. Changes in regulatory requirements can be reflected in revised permit limits and conditions when permits are renewed, typically on a five year cycle, or when treatment capacity is expanded. Capital improvements are planned and budgeted to meet normal replacement and renewal needs, anticipated changes in regulations, needs for increased capacity related to projected growth, and to reduce inflow and infiltration to collection systems. The various state utility commissions have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting wastewater rates for current and new customers. It is our policy to obtain and maintain the permits necessary for the treatment of the wastewater that we return to the environment. 

Natural Gas Supply and Transportation Facilities - Our natural gas supply strategy is to ensure a dependable gas supply that is economically priced and which is available for delivery when needed. We purchase natural gas from intrastate, interstate and local sources, and transport natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms, including extensions, varying from one month to 15 years. We anticipate that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration.

The regulations of the states in which we operate natural gas utilities allow us to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas to our customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in our tariffs. Depending upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically, ranging from quarterly to annually. The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies.

We use various third-party storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peak-day requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather.

We own and operate underground natural gas storage facilities with capacity of 10.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Total working capacity is 5.2 Bcf for use during the heating season with a maximum daily withdrawal rate of 115.5 million cubic feet (MMcf). Additionally, we have contracted for off-system storage from interstate pipelines. The total amount of off-system storage under contract is 35.6 Bcf with a maximum daily withdrawal rate of 598.6 MMcf.

 



On an ongoing basis, we enter into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements. However, it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions, transportation constraints, and other events. As a result of these factors, supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time, or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors. We enter into firm agreements with suppliers, including major producers and marketers, intended to provide flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. In Pennsylvania, our distribution system is connected to six interstate pipelines, where we maintain capacity we believe is sufficient to meet our customers’ gas requirements. In Kentucky, our distribution system is connected to four interstate pipelines, where we maintain capacity we believe is sufficient to meet our customers’ gas requirements. In West Virginia, our distribution system is connected to one interstate pipeline, as well as local production, where we maintain capacity we believe is sufficient to meet our customers’ gas requirements.

Natural Gas Gathering - Our Pennsylvania Regulated Natural Gas service territory is situated in the Marcellus Shale production region. Approximately 28% of the natural gas supply on the system is from locally produced gas, which we gather and transport into our distribution system. Our gathering system is regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission which includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, anti-discrimination requirements, and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Our gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate.

Our Regulated Natural Gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement, and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but our Regulated Natural Gas segment could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Refer to further discussion below in the Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation and Compliance section.

Economic Regulation

Most of our utility operations are subject to regulation by their respective state utility commissions, which have broad administrative power and authority to regulate billing rates, determine franchise areas and conditions of service, approve acquisitions, and authorize the issuance of securities. The utility commissions also establish uniform systems of accounts and approve the terms of contracts with affiliates and customers, business combinations with other utility systems, and loans and other financings. The policies of the utility commissions often differ from state to state, and may change over time. A small number of our water and wastewater utility operations are subject to rate regulation by county or city governments. The profitability of our utility operations is influenced to a great extent by the timeliness and adequacy of rate allowances we are granted by the respective utility commissions or authorities in the various states in which we operate. 




Rate Case Management Capability – We maintain a rate case management capability, the objective of which is to provide that the tariffs of our utility operations reflect, to the extent practicable, the timely recovery of increases in costs of operations, capital expenditures, interest expense, taxes, energy, materials, and compliance with environmental regulations as well as a return on equity. We file rate increase requests to recover and earn a fair return on the infrastructure investments that we make in improving or replacing our facilities and to recover expense increases. In the states in which we operate, we are primarily subject to economic regulation by the following state utility commissions:



State | Utility Commission 
Pennsylvania | Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission 
Ohio | Public Utilities Commission of Ohio 
North Carolina | North Carolina Utilities Commission 
Texas | Public Utility Commission of Texas 
Illinois | Illinois Commerce Commission 
New Jersey | New Jersey Board of Public Utilities 
Kentucky | Public Service Commission of Kentucky 
Virginia | Virginia State Corporation Commission 
Indiana | Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission 
West Virginia | Public Service Commission of West Virginia


Our water and wastewater operations are comprised of 47 rate divisions, and our natural gas operations are comprised of four rate divisions. Each of our utility rate divisions require a separate rate filing for the evaluation of the cost of service, including the recovery of investments, in connection with the establishment of rates for that rate division. When feasible and beneficial to our utility customers, we will seek approval from the applicable state regulatory commission to consolidate rate divisions to achieve a more even distribution of costs over a larger customer base. All of the states in which we operate permit us to file a revenue requirement for some form of consolidated rates for all, or some, of the rate divisions in that state.

In Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky, we may bill our utility customers, in certain circumstances, in accordance with a rate filing that is pending before the respective regulatory commission, which would allow for interim rates. As of December 31, 2022, we have no billings under interim rate arrangements for rate case filings in progress. Furthermore, some utility commissions authorize the use of expense deferrals and amortization in order to provide for an impact on our operating income by an amount that approximates the requested amount in a rate request. In these states, the additional revenue billed and collected prior to the final regulatory commission ruling is subject to refund to customers based on the outcome of the ruling. The revenue recognized and the expenses deferred by us reflect an estimate as to the final outcome of the ruling. If the request is denied completely or in part, we could be required to refund to customers some or all of the revenue billed to date and write-off some or all of the deferred expenses.

Revenue Surcharges – Eight states in which we operate water and wastewater utilities, and two states, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, in which we operate natural gas utilities permit us to add an infrastructure rehabilitation surcharge to their respective bills to offset the additional depreciation and capital costs associated with capital expenditures related to replacing and rehabilitating infrastructure systems. Without this surcharge, a utility absorbs all of the depreciation and capital costs of these projects between base rate increases. The gap between the time that a capital project is completed and the recovery of its costs in rates is known as regulatory lag. This surcharge is intended to substantially reduce regulatory lag, which could act as a disincentive for utilities to rehabilitate their infrastructure. In addition, our subsidiaries in some states use a surcharge or credit on their bills to reflect changes in costs, such as changes in state tax rates, other taxes and purchased water costs, until such time as the new cost levels are incorporated into base rates.

The infrastructure rehabilitation surcharge typically adjusts periodically based on additional qualified capital expenditures completed or anticipated in a future period, and is capped at a percentage of base rates, generally at 5% to 12.75%, and is reset to zero when new base rates that reflect the costs of those additions become effective or when a utility’s earnings exceed a regulatory benchmark. These surcharges provided revenues of $26,902,294 in 2022, 33,771,486 in 2021, and $13,038,555 in 2020. 




In the majority of our natural gas service territories, the public utility commissions have authorized bare steel and cast-iron replacement programs. In Pennsylvania, we filed a Long-Term Infrastructure Replacement program with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission where we have committed to the replacement of bare steel and cast-iron pipe. On February 14, 2012, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Act 11 of 2012, which provided a Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) mechanism for certain utilities to recover costs related to repair, replacement or improvement of eligible distribution property that has not previously been reflected in rates or rate base. Through this Pennsylvania DSIC, subject to an earnings test, a utility may recover the fixed costs of eligible infrastructure incurred during the three months ended one month prior to the effective date of the charge, thereby reducing the historical regulatory lag associated with cost recovery through the traditional rate-making process. In Kentucky, we have a pipe replacement program tariff, which allows adjustment of regulated rates annually to earn a return on capital expenditures incurred subsequent to our last rate case which were associated with the replacement of bare steel and vintage plastic pipe.

Gas costs incurred to serve our natural gas customers represent a significant operating expense. Our regulated natural gas rates, in all jurisdictions, contain a Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA), which is reflected in our tariffs. The PGA allows us to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas, inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on actual experience. PGA procedures involve periodic filings and hearings before the state regulatory commissions to establish price adjustments for a designated future period. The procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the estimated costs and actual costs incurred. The PGA is subject to periodic review and audit by the state regulatory commissions who also have the authority to disallow previously incurred costs.

In Pennsylvania, the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense, gas procurement costs, and certain costs to maintain a supplier choice program, where customers can elect their natural gas supplier, are recovered by mechanisms outside of typical base rate recovery. Additionally, in Pennsylvania, we recover the costs related to universal service programs, whereby customers who meet certain income guidelines receive assistance toward paying their monthly bill, weatherization services, and other programs. In Kentucky, the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense is recovered by a recovery mechanism outside of base rate recovery.

Income Tax Accounting Change – In 2012, Aqua Pennsylvania adopted an income tax accounting method change, implemented on Essential Utilities’ 2012 federal income tax return. This accounting method change allows a tax deduction for qualifying utility asset improvements that were formerly capitalized for tax purposes, and was implemented in response to a June 2012 rate order issued by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The Pennsylvania rate order requires use of the flow-through method of income tax benefits which results in a reduction in current income tax expense through the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the accounting method change. In the first rate order since 2012, Aqua Pennsylvania received a 2019 rate case order that provided for $158,864,688 of income tax deductions, for its water customers, annually, from the flow-through recognition of the Aqua Pennsylvania income tax accounting change, subject to a collar of $3,000,000 above or below; with the cumulative differences either refunded or recovered in the subsequent rate case. In May 2022, Aqua Pennsylvania received a rate case order that provided for a base rate increase that provides a target deduction of $159,060,000 and a collar-mechanism of $4,000,000. 

On March 16, 2020, the Company completed the Peoples Gas Acquisition. In March 2020 and June 2022, the Company changed the method of tax accounting for certain qualifying infrastructure investments at its Peoples Natural Gas and Peoples Gas subsidiaries, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company made a similar change for its Aqua New Jersey subsidiary, beginning with the current tax year. These changes allow a tax deduction for qualifying utility asset improvement costs that were formerly capitalized for tax purposes. Consistent with the Company’s accounting for differences between book and tax expenditures for its Aqua Pennsylvania subsidiary, the Company is utilizing the flow-through method to account for this timing difference. For Peoples Natural Gas, the Company calculated the income tax benefits for qualifying capital expenditures made prior to March 16, 2020 (catch-up adjustment) and has recorded a regulatory liability for $160,655,000 for these income tax benefits. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement petition that allows Peoples Natural Gas to continue to use flow-through accounting for the current tax repair benefit and allows for the catch-up adjustment be given to its customers. These benefits are being provided back to customers over a five-year period through a credit on customer bills which commenced in August 2021. In addition, the settlement petition required the contribution of $500,000 to a customer-bill payment assistance program, completed in July 2021, and $5,000,000 in relief to past-due accounts for natural gas customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, completed in December 2021. For Peoples Gas, the Company calculated the catch-up adjustment 

 

from the periods prior to the 2021 tax year and recognized a regulatory liability of $13,808,000 for these income tax benefits. The Company will maintain this regulatory liability on its consolidated balance sheet until accounting treatment is determined in its next base rate case.

Fair Market Value Legislation – In April 2016, Pennsylvania enacted legislation allowing the public utility commission to utilize fair market value to set ratemaking rate base instead of the depreciated original cost of water or wastewater assets for certain qualifying municipal acquisitions. The legislation includes a process for engaging two independent utility valuation experts to perform appraisals that are filed with the public utility commission and then averaged and compared to the purchase price. The ratemaking rate base is the lower of the average of the appraisals or the purchase price and is subject to regulatory approval. Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Texas also have legislation that allows the use of fair market value under varying rules and circumstances. We believe that this legislation encourages consolidation in the water and wastewater industry, providing municipalities with an option for exiting the business if they are dealing with challenges associated with their aging, deteriorating water and wastewater assets, do not have the expertise or technical capabilities to continue to comply with ever-increasing environmental regulations, or simply want to focus on other community priorities. 

Revenue Stability Mechanisms – Revenue stability mechanisms separate the volume of water sold from our ability to meet our cost of service and infrastructure costs. These mechanisms allows us to recognize revenue based on a target amount established in the last rate case, and then record either a regulatory asset or liability based on the cumulative difference over time, which results in either a refund due to customers or a payment from customers. In Illinois, our operating subsidiary utilizes a revenue stability mechanism. Additionally, a weather-normalization adjustment (WNA) mechanism is in place for our natural gas customers served in Kentucky. The WNA serves to minimize the effects of weather on the Company’s results for its residential and small commercial natural gas customers. This regulatory mechanism adjusts revenues earned for the variance between actual and normal weather and can have either positive (warmer than normal) or negative (colder than normal) effects on revenues. Customer bills are adjusted in the December through April billing months, with rates adjusted for the difference between actual revenues and revenues calculated under this mechanism billed to the customers.

Competition

In general, we believe that Essential Utilities and its water, wastewater, and natural gas subsidiaries have valid authority, free from unduly burdensome restrictions, to enable us to carry on our business as presently conducted in the franchised or contracted areas we now serve. The rights to provide water, wastewater, or natural gas service to customers in a particular franchised service territory are generally non-exclusive, although the applicable utility commissions usually allow only one regulated utility to provide service to customers in a given area. In some instances, another water utility provides service to a separate area within the same political subdivision served by one of our subsidiaries. Additionally, our larger natural gas customers may bypass gas distribution services by gaining distribution directly from interstate pipelines, other gas distributors, or other energy sources. As a regulated utility, we believe there is little competition for the daily water, wastewater, and natural gas service we provide to our customers. 

Although our natural gas subsidiaries are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas in its service areas, we do compete with suppliers of other forms of energy such as fuel oil, electricity, propane, coal, wind, and solar. Competition can be intense among the energy sources with price being the primary consideration. This is particularly true for industrial customers who have the ability to switch to alternative fuels. Natural gas generally benefits from a competitive price advantage over oil, electricity, and propane. Competition from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind is likely to increase as the political environment currently favors these energy sources through incentives or by placing restrictions on emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. 




Water and wastewater utilities may compete for the acquisition of other water and wastewater utilities or for acquiring new customers in new service territories. Competition for these acquisitions generally comes from nearby utilities, either other regulated utilities or municipal-owned utilities, and sometimes from strategic or financial purchasers seeking to enter or expand in the water and wastewater industry. We compete for new service territories and the acquisition of other utilities on the following bases: 


economic value; 
economies of scale; 
our ability to provide quality water, wastewater, and natural gas service; 
our existing infrastructure network; 
our ability to perform infrastructure improvements; 
our ability to comply with environmental, health, and safety regulations; 
our technical, regulatory, and operational expertise; 
our ability to access capital markets; and 
our cost of capital. 

The addition of new service territories and the acquisition of other utilities by regulated utilities such as the Company are generally subject to review and approval by the applicable state utility commissions.

In a very small number of instances in one of our southern states, where there are municipally-owned water or wastewater systems near our operating divisions, the municipally-owned system may either have water distribution or wastewater collection mains that are located adjacent to our division's mains or may construct new mains that parallel our mains.  In these rare circumstances, the municipally-owned system may attempt to voluntarily offer service to customers who are connected to our mains, resulting in our mains becoming surplus or underutilized without compensation.

In the states where our water subsidiaries operate, it is possible that portions of our subsidiaries’ operations could be acquired by municipal governments by one or more of the following methods: 

eminent domain; 
the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original franchise was granted; and, 
the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its permit.

The price to be paid upon such an acquisition by the municipal government is usually determined in accordance with applicable law under eminent domain. In other instances, the price may be negotiated, fixed by appraisers selected by the parties, or computed in accordance with a formula prescribed in the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter. We believe that our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets that are condemned, and we believe the fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets.

Despite maintaining a program to monitor condemnation interests and activities that may affect us over time, one of our primary strategies continues to be to acquire additional water and wastewater systems, to maintain our existing systems where there is a business or a strategic benefit, and to actively oppose unilateral efforts by municipal governments to acquire any of our operations, particularly for less than the fair market value of our operations or where the municipal government seeks to acquire more than it is entitled to under the applicable law or agreement. On occasion, we may voluntarily agree to sell systems or portions of systems in order to help focus our efforts in areas where we have more critical mass and economies of scale or for other strategic reasons. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation and Compliance

The Company’s mission is “to sustain life and improve economic prosperity by safely and reliably delivering Earth’s most essential resources to customers and communities”. We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the public and continue to adhere to applicable regulatory standards. We 

 

integrate environmental, health, and safety requirements into planning, decision-making, construction, operating, and maintenance activities that we perform. 

Provision of water and wastewater services is subject to regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, and related state laws, and under federal and state regulations issued under these laws. These laws and regulations establish criteria and standards for drinking water and for wastewater discharges. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state. In some instances, a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. For example, while the EPA has announced the intention to propose drinking water regulations for two PFAS compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS) and issued non-enforceable lifetime and Interim Health Advisory Levels for PFOA, PFOS and two other PFAS compounds, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has already established enforceable drinking water standards for three PFAS compounds (PFOA, PFOS, and perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection also recently enacted enforceable drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS in advance of the federal EPA proposed regulations. In addition, we are subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal, dam safety, and other aspects of our operations. Capital expenditures and operating costs required as a result of water quality standards and environmental requirements have been traditionally recognized by state utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.

From time to time, Essential Utilities has acquired, and may acquire, systems that have environmental compliance issues. Environmental compliance issues also arise in the course of normal operations or as a result of regulatory changes. Essential Utilities attempts to align capital budgeting and expenditures to address these issues in due course. We believe that the capital expenditures required to address outstanding environmental compliance issues in our water and wastewater systems have been budgeted in our capital program and represent approximately $118,984,000, or less than 5% of our expected total water and wastewater capital expenditures over the next five years (2023-2027). We are parties to agreements with regulatory agencies in Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Illinois under which we have committed to make improvements for environmental compliance. These agreements are intended to provide the regulators with assurance that problems covered by these agreements will be addressed, and the agreements generally provide protection from fines, penalties, and other actions while corrective measures are being implemented. We are working with state environmental officials in Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Illinois to implement or amend regulatory agreements as necessary.

Our Regulated Natural Gas utility operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. Legislative and regulatory actions to address climate change are in various phases of review or implementation in the United States. These measures could include emissions limits, reporting requirements, carbon taxes, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy or use renewable energy sources. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to assess, clean up, and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released.

Safe Drinking Water Act - The Safe Drinking Water Act establishes criteria and procedures for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop national quality standards for drinking water. Regulations issued pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act set standards regarding the amount of microbial and chemical contaminants and radionuclides in drinking water. Current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations as we have made and are making investments to meet existing water quality standards. We may, in the future, be required to change our method of treating drinking water at some sources of supply and make additional capital investments if additional regulations become effective.

Clean Water Act - The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams, and groundwater. It is our policy to obtain and maintain all required permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities, and to comply with all conditions of those permits and other regulatory requirements. A program is in place to monitor facilities for compliance with permitting, monitoring and reporting for wastewater discharges. From time to time, discharge violations may occur which may result in fines. These 

 

fines and penalties, if any, are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are also parties to agreements with regulatory agencies in several states where we operate while improvements are being made to address wastewater discharge issues. The EPA has identified leveraging wastewater discharge permitting and application of biosolids, or sewage sludge, containing PFAS as areas of focus in its PFAS Strategic Roadmap.

Solid Waste Disposal - The handling and disposal of waste generated from water and wastewater treatment facilities is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. A program is in place to monitor our facilities for compliance with regulatory requirements, and we are not aware of any significant environmental remediation costs necessary from our handling and disposal of waste material from our water and wastewater operations. 

Dam Safety - Our subsidiaries own 30 dams, of which 14 are classified as high hazard dams that are subject to the requirements of the federal and state regulations related to dam safety, which undergo regular inspections and an annual engineering inspection. After a thorough review and inspection of our dams by professional outside engineering firms, we believe that all 14 dams are structurally sound and well-maintained, except as described below. These inspections provide recommendations for ongoing rehabilitation which we include in our capital improvement program. The Company has approximately $25,680,000 in capital improvements budgeted between 2023 and 2027 for dam improvements. 

We performed studies of our dams that identified five high hazard dams in Pennsylvania and one high hazard dam in Ohio requiring capital improvements. These capital improvements result from the adoption by state regulatory agencies of revised formulas for calculating the magnitude of a possible maximum flood event. The most significant capital improvement remaining to be performed in our dam improvement program is on one dam in Pennsylvania at a total estimated cost of $10,290,000. Design for this dam commenced in 2013 and construction is expected to be completed in 2027. 

A previously-owned Ohio dam requiring capital improvements was no longer used for water supply and was sold to a third party in December 2020. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to complete certain dam capital improvements after the sale for an estimated cost of $2,100,000. The repairs were completed in 2022. 

Lead and Copper Rule – The events in Flint, Michigan, which commenced in 2014, and other communities have brought attention to the issue of lead in drinking water from home plumbing. Lead in drinking water can come from lead that leaches from service lines, home plumbing solder, and fixtures or faucets. Since the Lead and Copper Rule in 1992, we have been working to prevent lead leaching from home plumbing sources by reducing water corrosivity and adding chemicals that can prevent leaching of lead in pipes and homes. We have a program to evaluate all changes in water sources and/or treatment prior to initiating a change in water supply. We also focus on identifying and removing lead service lines and encouraging customers to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line if it is lead as they are identified during our main replacement program or during other maintenance activities. We support the recommendations of The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, a collaborative of leading water industry, housing, and health organizations that has recommended full replacement of lead service lines as a “best practice” to reduce lead in drinking water, but we generally only have control over the company-owned portion of each service line. In cases where we are replacing a company-owned lead service line, our standard approach is to replace the company-owned portion and advise and encourage the customer to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line, all the way to the customer’s home. In Pennsylvania, we have the legal and regulatory authority to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line and will attempt to obtain customer permission to do so. We also advise customers of the potential health impacts of lead in drinking water, and conduct lead testing at homes following replacement of a lead service line. 

On January 15, 2021 the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) that included deadlines for lead service line inventories and replacement plans, and then signed a final rule on June 10, 2021 to extend the effective date of the LCRR to December 16, 2021.   This action extends the LCRR requirement to submit a lead service line inventory and a lead service line replacement plan to the respective states or agencies by October 16, 2024.  We are continuing to enhance our lead service line inventory and refine our lead service line replacement plans which we expect to complete by the deadline. Additionally, EPA is developing a new regulation, the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI), to better protect communities from exposure to lead in drinking water.  The LCRI is expected to delay the due dates for lead service line replacement plans and result in modifications to other parts of the LCRR.  We are executing an implementation plan to comply with the initial LCRR requirement to complete a lead service line inventory.  Capital 

 

expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions will be determined once the EPA finalizes the rule.  

Partnership for Safe Water Program – Essential Utilities is a proud participant in the American Water Works Association’s (AWWA) Partnership for Safe Water Program.  This voluntary program is a commitment to excellence within the drinking water community above and beyond EPA’s stringent treatment goals.  All of our active surface water treatment plants (within Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia) maintain good standing in the program which includes many awards of achievement.  The honors include the “Director’s Award” (achieved at seven systems) which recognizes plants that have: 1) completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, 2) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and 3) provided several evaluations of performance demonstrating operational excellence.  Several of our systems have met these criteria annually and have received 5, 10, 15, and 20 year subscriber awards. Furthermore, our Roaring Creek Pennsylvania treatment plant has received the Phase IV Excellence Award, the highest honor achieved in the Partnership Program. 

Safety Standards - Our facilities and operations may be subject to inspections by representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from time to time. We maintain safety policies and procedures to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s rules and regulations, but violations may occur from time to time, which may result in fines and penalties, which are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We endeavor to correct such violations promptly when they come to our attention.

Pipeline Safety Improvement Act- In December 2006, Congress enacted the Pipeline, Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (2006 Act), which reauthorized the programs adopted under the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (2002 Act). These programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety, and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration.

Pursuant to the 2006 Act, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency of the US Department of Transportation (DOT), issued regulations, effective February 12, 2010, requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines, but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines. Operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement integrity management programs by August 2, 2011. Peoples’ natural gas distribution systems met this deadline.

Pursuant to the 2002 Act and the 2006 Act, PHMSA has adopted a number of rules concerning, among other things, distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities, requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion, and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs. PHMSA also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective January 1, 2011.

In December 2011, Congress passed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Act). This act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions; required the DOT to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety; required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure; and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements. In 2016, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Act) reauthorized PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority, including the ability to issue emergency orders, to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities, as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of as-yet-incomplete PHMSA actions required by the 2011 Act.

In June 2021, PHMSA issued an advisory bulletin to address a self-executing mandate as part of the 2016 Act. This Leak Detection and Reduction (LDAR) bulletin requires operators to update standard operating procedures to address leaks and gas releases which may be hazardous to public safety and the environment.

In November 2021, PHMSA published the final gathering line rule, with a tentative effective date of May 2022. This rule will require preventative and mitigative measures on gathering lines of certain diameters and operating pressures.




Compliance with PHMSA’s regulations, performance of the remediation activities by our natural gas distribution companies and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs. The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors, including age, location and operating pressures of the facilities. In particular, the cost of compliance with the DOT’s integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing. Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management, whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas, may also affect incurred costs. Implementation of the 2011 and 2016 Acts by PHMSA may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs. In addition, we may be subject to the DOT’s enforcement actions and penalties if it fails to comply with pipeline regulations.

Inflation Reduction Act - On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law, which among other things, includes a provision to implement an annual waste emissions charge beginning with calendar year 2024 (to be paid in 2025) on applicable oil and gas facilities that exceed certain methane emission thresholds.  Currently, the Company has gathering facility assets that could exceed the minimum thresholds and potentially be subject to the waste emissions charge. We are continuing to assess the future impact of the provisions of the IRA on our consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s gathering assets. As a regulated utility, required capital expenditures and operating costs, including taxes, have been traditionally recognized by state utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.  

Security
We maintain security measures at our facilities, and collaborate with federal, state and local authorities and industry trade associations regarding information on possible threats and security measures for water, wastewater, and natural gas utility operations. The costs incurred are expected to be recoverable in customer rates and are not expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We also maintain cyber security protection measures with respect to our information technology, including our customer data, and, in some cases, the monitoring and operation of our treatment, storage, pumping, and pipeline infrastructure. We rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business, especially with respect to customer service and billing, accounting and, in some cases, the monitoring and operation of our treatment, storage, pumping, and pipeline infrastructure. In addition, we rely on our systems to track our utility assets and to manage maintenance and construction projects, materials and supplies, and our human resource functions. 

Environmental Sustainability
The way we do business at Essential reflects our commitment to a sustainable, safe, and healthy environment for all our stakeholders. Sustainability is deeply engrained in our business strategy. We integrate environmental requirements into the planning, decision-making, engineering, construction, operating, and maintenance activities that we perform.

We understand the urgency of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s science-based target of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, 79% are driven by our gas distribution business. Early in 2021, we announced that by 2035 we will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 60% from our 2019 baseline. This is consistent with the rate of reduction necessary through 2035 to keep on track with the Paris Agreement. This will be achieved by extensive gas pipeline replacement, renewable energy purchasing, accelerated methane leak detection and repair, and various other currently planned initiatives that are highly feasible with proven technology.  In 2021, we have achieved 6% emissions reduction from our 2019 baseline. Subsequently, in 2022, we began procuring nearly 100% renewable electricity for our water and wastewater operations in Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

The Company’s environmental sustainability initiatives and strategy are discussed further in our environmental, social, and governance reporting, which can be found on our website at www.esg.essential.co. Such reports are not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K.

Human Capital Management

 


The Company values its workforce as one of its most important assets. The Company is dedicated to creating a sustainable working atmosphere for its employees to attract and retain the best employees. Human capital measures and objectives that the Company focuses on in managing its business include the health and safety of its employees, succession planning, voluntary attrition rate, and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 3,187 full-time employees. Our subsidiaries are parties to 20 labor agreements with labor unions covering 1,619 employees. The labor agreements expire at various times up until 2027.
Health and Safety - Safety is the foundation of our business and guides all our employees’ actions. The Company continues to invest in safety improvements, implement policies and procedures, develop technical training and guidelines for our employees, and leverage new tools and technology to improve our maps, records and infrastructure performance. The Company’s Safety Council leads our safety efforts and is supported by state and facility committees and leaders that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified, and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. To encourage managers to promote a safe environment, related metrics are incorporated in management’s incentive compensation plans. 

The Company provides access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient employee health and wellness programs. We proactively conduct communications outreach to our employees and their family members on relevant health topics.  With the focus on mental health becoming more of a central part of an employee’s well-being, we have added additional resources and counseling access for employees and their families to utilize to ensure they take care of themselves.

Employee Development and Training - The Company continues to invest in training and development programs for employees so that they may evolve and enhance their skills in their areas of expertise. We also offer tuition reimbursement to all regular, full-time employees. At Essential, we believe in an integrated talent development approach. We utilize the “70/20/10 model” for development, which holds that 70% of learning happens on the job through stretch goals and critical assignments, 20% of learning occurs through mentoring and coaching and involvement in professional and industry related activities, and 10% of learning occurs within a virtual or live learning environment. We align our development model to support our vision, mission, and competencies, with a balanced approach to developing our workforce that leads us to the development of a confident, committed, and high-performance culture.

Succession Planning - Under the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors is responsible for the development and periodic review of a management succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer and other executives. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews the Company’s succession planning process for the Chief Executive Officer and the named executive officers. During this review, the directors review succession candidates on an immediate basis and more developmental candidates to ensure that the Company is well-prepared for the future. 

Voluntary Attrition and Turnover - The Company measures turnover rates of its employees in assessing the Company’s overall human capital. The Company’s voluntary attrition rate (not including retirements) for 2022 was 3% at the executive and senior management level, 9% at the mid-level manager level, 14% at the professional level, and 9% across all other employees. These voluntary attrition rates increased from 2021. We believe issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a strong labor market, and the large national increase in employee retirements and attrition impacted us as well as other companies. We are working to develop programs focused on retaining our workforce. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion - Diversity of backgrounds, ideas, thoughts, and experiences is essential to our culture and the way we do business. Creating an environment where our differences are valued and where every person feels a sense of belonging and engagement supports a thriving organization that cares about our customers and ensures our continued long-term success. In order to promote a culture of diversity and inclusion, we have conducted educational workshops to foster better understanding of different points of view and how pre-conceived notions impact relationships at work. We also support diverse segments of our workforce through employee resource groups, such as the Black Resource Group, LGBTQ+ Pride Resource Group, and Women’s Resource Group. These groups welcome participation from all employees in order to learn from a cultural perspective and support each other through allyship. 

Diversifying the workforce continues to be a focus at all levels of the Company. Beginning in 2021, we added an employee diversity component (5% weighting) to our short term incentive plan. Our focus on attracting and retaining diverse talent has resulted in growth in the number of our diverse employees from 15% in 2021 to 16% in 2022. Diversity 

 

at the management level has also remained steady in 2022, with 10% of the management team comprised of minorities, and 22% of the management team comprised of women by the end of 2022. We have a range of diverse recruitment tactics and believe we can achieve our multiyear plan of reaching 17% employees of color. 

We also believe diversity in our Board of Directors is critical for effective governance. Candidates for nomination to the Board are considered by the Corporate Governance Committee based on their personal abilities, qualifications, independence, knowledge, judgment, character, leadership skills, education, background (including, but not limited to race, gender, and national origin), and their expertise and experience in fields and disciplines relevant to the Company. In October 2021, we were recognized as a Champion of Board Diversity by The Forum of Executive Women for having one-third of our board comprised of women. In June, 2022, we were named a 2022 Vibrant Pittsburgh Champion being recognized as one of the exceptional organizations who is leading the way in diversity and inclusion in the region.

Communication and Engagement –We believe that our employees are critical to our business, and it is essential to have an environment of high engagement and inclusivity in which employees thrive. We value feedback from our employees, as it helps us gain a deeper understanding of areas where we are doing well and where we need improvement. In 2022, we have invited all employees to participate in a bi-annual culture assessment by completing an anonymous survey. We have worked with various functional areas to create and implement action plans to address areas of employee concern. Executive management also regularly conducts town hall-style meetings with employees, where they have the opportunity to ask questions, voice opinions, and share feedback. 

Citizenship – As a mission-based organization, we are driven to improve the quality of life and livelihood of our customers and the communities we serve. Through our charitable giving program, employees are encouraged to engage in philanthropy through the United Way campaign and matching gift program. At various times throughout the year, the Company supports its employees in volunteering their time and talents to give back to their communities.

Supplier Diversity

We acknowledge that supplier diversity is critical for our communities as well as for our business. We are committed to increasing our work with qualified and certified diverse suppliers from the communities and neighborhoods where we live, work, and operate each day and suppliers that use reasonable efforts to minimize pollution and improve environmental protection and sustainability. As such, we announced a multi-year plan to increase diverse supplier spend to 15% of controllable spend, which excludes spend where there is no opportunity to include diverse suppliers or spend that cannot be sourced from a diverse supplier due to a policy or law (items like power, purchased water and some one-time payments). Beginning in 2021, we added a supplier diversity component (5% weighting) to our short-term incentive plan. We also have a Supplier Code of Conduct that defines the basic requirements for suppliers of goods and services and their responsibilities to the environment and their stakeholders. We also expect our suppliers to subscribe to the principles of nondiscrimination, follow high standards of business ethics and professional conduct and adhere to our Human Rights Policy.
Management and Board Oversight 
Our Board of Directors has various committees including an audit committee, an executive compensation committee, a corporate governance committee, and a risk mitigation and investment policy committee. Each of these committees has a formal charter. We also have Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Ethical Business Conduct. Copies of these charters, guidelines, and codes can be obtained free of charge from our Investor Relations page on our web site, www.essential.co. In the event we amend or waive any portion of the Code of Ethical Business Conduct that applies to any of our directors, executive officers, or senior financial officers, we will post that information on our web site.
