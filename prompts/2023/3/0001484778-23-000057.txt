Item 1.    Business
thredUP operates one of the world’s largest online resale platforms for apparel, shoes and accessories. Our mission is to inspire a new generation of consumers to think secondhand first. We believe in a sustainable fashion future and we are proud that our business model creates a positive impact to the benefit of our buyers, sellers, clients, employees, investors and the environment. Our custom-built operating platform consists of distributed processing infrastructure, proprietary software and systems and data science expertise. This platform is powering the rapidly emerging resale economy, one of the fastest growing sectors in retail, according to a GlobalData market survey conducted in February 2022.
thredUP’s proprietary operating platform is the foundation for our managed marketplace, where we have bridged online and offline technology to make the buying and selling of tens of millions of unique items easy and fun. Our marketplaces enable buyers to browse and purchase resale items for primarily women’s and kids’ apparel, shoes and accessories across a wide range of price points. Buyers love shopping value, premium and luxury brands all in one place, at up to 90% off estimated retail prices. Sellers love thredUP because we make it easy to clean out their closets and unlock value for themselves or for the charity of their choice while doing good for the planet. thredUP’s sellers order a Clean Out Kit, fill it and return it to us using our prepaid label. We take it from there and do the work to make those accepted items available for resale. 
In addition to our core marketplace, some of the world’s leading brands and retailers are already taking advantage of our Resale-as-a-Service (“RaaS”) offering, which allows them to conveniently offer a scalable closet clean out service and/or resale shop to their customers. We believe RaaS will accelerate the growth of this emerging category and form the backbone of the modern resale experience domestically and internationally.
In 2021, we acquired Remix Global AD (“Remix”), a fashion resale company headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria, which further expands our reach to the European customer. With this acquisition, we added a complementary operational infrastructure and an experienced management team to enable our expansion into Europe. In addition, Remix’s product assortment extends our resale offering to include men’s items and items sourced from a variety of supply channels, such as wholesale supply.
We have built a differentiated and defensible operating platform to enable resale at scale, combining:
•Distributed Processing Infrastructure. Our infrastructure is purpose-built for “single SKU” logistics, meaning that virtually every item processed is unique, came from or belongs to an individual seller and is individually tracked using its own stock keeping unit (“SKU”). As of December 31, 2022, we operated distribution centers that could collectively hold more than 7.3 million items in locations across the United States and Europe. Our operations are highly scalable, and we have the ability to process more than 100,000 unique SKUs per day across our existing distribution center footprint. We drive continuous operational efficiency through proprietary technology and ongoing automation of our infrastructure. Our existing United States-based distribution centers are located in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Texas. By locating our facilities in strategic locations across the country, we can be closer to our buyers and sellers, which allows us to reduce shipping times in transit, and lower our inbound and outbound shipping costs. Our European-based distribution center, which services nine countries in Central and Eastern Europe, is located in Sofia, Bulgaria.
•Proprietary Software and Systems. Our facilities run on a suite of our custom-built applications designed for “single SKU” operations. Our engineering team has implemented large-scale, innovative and patented automation for put-away, storage, picking and packing at scale. This automation results in reduced labor and fixed costs while increasing storage density and throughput capacity. Our proprietary software, systems and processes enable efficient quality assurance, item-attribution, sizing and photography.
•Data Science Expertise. We harness our robust, structured data set across our business to optimize economic decisions, such as pricing, seller payouts, item acceptance, merchandising and sell-through. We also leverage data to power efficient customer acquisition and lifetime engagement, and to provide a personalized shopping experience.
We generate revenue primarily from items that are sold to buyers on our websites and mobile app and from integration and service fees charged in connection with our RaaS offerings.
Our revenue is comprised of consignment sales and direct product sales. With consignment sales, we recognize revenue net of seller payouts, and cost of revenue includes outbound shipping, outbound labor and packaging costs. With direct product sales, we recognize revenue on a gross basis, and cost of revenue mainly includes inventory cost, inbound shipping and inventory write-downs, as well as outbound shipping, outbound labor and packaging costs. Our buyers generally pay us upfront when they purchase an item.
We recognize revenue from our Remix platform primarily through direct product sales. We anticipate that over time revenue from the Remix platform will migrate to become primarily consignment sales as we introduce and expand the Clean Out Kit model that we pioneered in the United States market.
In mid-2021, we began structuring our RaaS offerings as sources of revenue. RaaS clients typically pay an upfront integration fee as well as ongoing service fees which are then recorded to consignment revenue. With RaaS, brands and retailers are leveraging our operating platform to deliver resale experiences to their customers across three main service modules: our Clean Out service, our cashout marketplace, and our full-service resale shops. This suite of offerings is called “Resale 360” and enables our RaaS clients to drive incremental revenue and access new customers while promoting a circular business model. As of December 31, 2022, we worked with 42 RaaS clients, including GAP, Hot Topic, Madewell, Reformation, Tommy Hilfiger, Torrid, and Walmart.
We have methodically scaled operating capacity and revenue, while increasing gross profit and improving our operating performance.
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, our buyers placed 6.5 million Orders, up 22% as compared to the same period in 2021.
Competition
Although we have built a scaled and highly differentiated platform and managed marketplace, we face intense competition. Our competitors include other apparel retailers, particularly retailers at an off-price or fast-fashion price point, vendors of new and secondhand items, including branded goods stores, local, national and global department stores, traditional brick-and-mortar consignment and thrift stores, specialty retailers, direct-to-consumer retailers, discount chains, independent retail stores, the online offerings of these traditional retail competitors, resale players focused on niche or single categories, as well as technology-enabled marketplaces that may offer the same or similar goods and services that we offer. Competitors offering the same or similar goods or services include:
•secondhand marketplaces, such as eBay Inc., Mercari, Inc., Poshmark, Inc., The RealReal, Inc., Vinted and Vestiaire Collective;
•large online retailers, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Target Corporation, Kohl’s Corporation and Walmart Inc.; and
•off-price retailers, such as Burlington Stores, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc. and The TJX Companies, Inc.
Additionally, we experience competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating To Our Business and Industry—The market in which we participate is competitive and rapidly changing, and if we do not compete effectively with established companies as well as new market entrants our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.”
We compete primarily on the basis of buyer and seller experience, product quality and assortment, breadth of brand offering, convenience and price. We believe that we are able to compete effectively because we offer buyers a vast selection of high-quality, secondhand and resale items at compelling prices with a fun and easy to use interface. For sellers, we offer an easy, convenient, reliable and fast way to recycle and monetize or donate their secondhand items.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, as well as other legal and contractual rights, to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
We have patents issued in the United States. These patents are intended to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. In addition, our proprietary algorithm technologies, other than those incorporated into a patent application, are protected by trade secret laws. 
We also hold trademarks in the United States as well as in other jurisdictions. “THREDUP” and “Think Secondhand First” are our registered trademarks in the United States. We have additional registered trademarks in the United States and “THREDUP” is registered in certain other non-United States jurisdictions. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective. Other trademarks and trade names referred to in this annual report are the property of their respective owners.
We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.thredup.com and other variations.
Regulation
We are subject to a variety of United States federal and state laws as well as international laws that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and in the retail industry, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations include laws governing the processing of payments, consumer protection and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations could make internet advertising more expensive, require burdensome disclosure to consumers or visitors to our website and restrict our ability to use consumer information to improve targeted advertisements. Further, these laws and regulations are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently still evolving. Laws and regulations may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business.
We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of consumer information. Our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including buyer and seller data. Any failure by us to comply with our policies or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.
Many jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. This growing focus on data privacy and regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us and could subject us to significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy and data of our sellers and buyers could result in a loss of confidence in our marketplaces, which could adversely affect our business.
Apparel, shoes and accessories sold by us are also subject to regulation in the United States by governmental agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing and product safety. We are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations. Similarly, apparel, shoes and accessories sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the United States concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 2,416 employees and professional contractors, including 2,011 distribution center employees. To our knowledge, none of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We supplement our workforce with contractors and consultants in the United States and internationally, including Ukrainian information technology, or IT, specialists. These Ukrainian IT specialists, who provide services on our behalf, are registered as “private entrepreneurs” with the tax authorities of Ukraine and operate as independent contractors. While we do not anticipate a reduction in force due to conflict in Ukraine, we anticipate that at least some of our Ukrainian IT specialists may be unable to work while the conflict is unresolved.
Our human capital resources objective is to cultivate a high-performing team by recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and professional contractors. Our culture is underpinned by our core values, including an unwavering commitment to learning, development, inclusion, diversity, equity and belonging. We believe our people are our greatest asset and are reimagining our employee experience to reflect that philosophy. We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. The core objective of our compensation program is to provide a package that will attract, motivate and reward exceptional employees who must operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment.
We believe that a unique perspective is critical to solving complex problems and inspiring a new generation of consumers to think secondhand first. Overall, as of December 31, 2022, 66% of our workforce identifies as female and 72% of our workforce identifies as minority, including 58% as Black or Latinx. As of December 31, 2022, 60% of our senior leadership team, which includes executives, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, senior directors, directors and general managers of operations, identifies as female and 26% of our senior leadership team identifies as minority, including 3% as Black or Latinx.
All full-time United States based employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan, eight weeks paid sabbatical after three years and 401k plan.
