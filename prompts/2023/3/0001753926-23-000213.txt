We also have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Italy, subsidiary, Interparfums Italia Srl and Hong Kong, Inter Parfums USA Hong Kong Limited.

Our telephone number in Paris is 331.5377.0000.

Interparfums SA is also the majority owner of Parfums Rochas Spain, SL, a Spanish limited liability company, which specializes in the distribution of Rochas fragrances. In addition, Interparfums SA is also the sole owner of Interparfums (Suisse) Sarl, a company formed to hold and manage certain brand names, and Interparfums Asia Pacific Pte., Ltd., an Asian sales and marketing office.

The following information is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with the more detailed information and audited financial statements, including the related notes, contained or incorporated by reference in this report.
 
General
 
We operate in the fragrance business and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. We manage our business in two segments, European based operations and United States based operations. Certain prestige fragrance products are produced and marketed by our European operations through our 72% owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company as 28% of Interparfums SA shares trade on the Euronext.
 
Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are either received and stored directly at our third-party fillers or received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers, which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.

Our fragrance products focus on prestige brands, each with a devoted following. By concentrating in markets where the brands are best known, we have had many successful product launches. We typically launch new fragrance families for our brands every few years, and more frequently seasonal and limited edition fragrances are introduced as well.
 
The creation and marketing of each product family is intimately linked with the brand’s name, its past and present positioning, customer base and, more generally, the prevailing market atmosphere. Accordingly, we generally study the market for each proposed family of fragrance products for almost a full year before we introduce any new product into the market. This study is intended to define the general position of the fragrance family and more particularly its scent, bottle, packaging and appeal to the buyer. In our opinion, the unity of these four elements of the marketing mix makes for a successful product.
 
As with any business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We believe we have a strong brand portfolio with global reach and potential. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue to make investments in fast-growing markets and channels to grow market share. We discuss in greater detail risk factors relating to our business in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and the reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.
 
European Operations
 
We produce and distribute our fragrance products primarily under license agreements with brand owners, and fragrance product sales through our European operations represented approximately 68% of net sales for 2022. We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Kate Spade, Lanvin, Moncler, Montblanc, Rochas, S.T. Dupont and Van Cleef & Arpels, whose products are distributed in over 120 countries around the world. European operations will also become the exclusive worldwide licensee for Lacoste fragrances on January 1, 2024.
 
United States Operations
 
Prestige brand fragrance products are also produced and marketed through our United States operations, and represented approximately 32% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. These fragrance products are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of brands, which include Abercrombie & Fitch, Anna Sui, Dunhill, Donna Karan, DKNY, Ferragamo, Graff, GUESS, Hollister, MCM, Oscar de la Renta and Ungaro.

The exclusive license became effective on July 1, 2022, and we are planning to launch new fragrances under these brands in 2024.
 
Rochas Fashion
 
Effective January 1, 2021, we entered into a new license agreement modifying our Rochas fashion business model. The new agreement calls for a reduction in royalties to be received. As a result, in the first quarter of 2021, we took a $2.4 million impairment charge on our Rochas fashion trademark. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we again took a $6.8 million impairment charge on the Rochas fashion trademark after an independent expert concluded that the valuation of the trademark was $11.3 million. The new license also contains an option for the licensee to buy-out the Rochas fashion trademarks in June 2025 at its then fair market value.

General
 
We are the owner of the Rochas brand, and the Lanvin brand name and trademark for our class of trade.

Over the past decade, we have worked in partnership with Anna Sui and her creative team to build upon the brand’s customer appeal and develop and market a family of fragrances including Fantasia, Sui Dreams and the newest scent, Sky, which was ranked as the second best perfume launch of 2021 by WWD Japan.
 
Boucheron— In 2010, we entered into an exclusive 15-year worldwide license agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance related products under the Boucheron brand. For over a century, since becoming the first jeweler to open a boutique on Place Vendôme in 1893, Boucheron has embodied very high-end creation, luxury and French know-how.

Boucheron’s legacy scents, Femme and Homme, and the legendary Jaipur perfume form the foundation of brand sales. Our team has enriched the portfolio with Quatre for men and women, along with several special editions, a growing collection of unique scents aptly named, La Collection, and Serpent Bohème.

Its unique style is expressed through unquestioning sensuality, purity of silhouette, flamboyant prints, and exquisite attention to details. Season after season, Emanuel Ungaro dared to be different, combining unexpected yet sensual clashes of bright colors and prints with beautiful draping. Today Ungaro fragrances uphold the same values of audacity and elegance, and the brand is best known and most prized internationally, and such presence will remain our sales focus as we continue to produce and distribute the brand’s legacy scents, notably Diva. Beginning in 2023, we plan to unveil a Diva brand extension.
 
Graff— In 2018, we entered into an exclusive, 8-year worldwide license agreement with London-based Graff for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the Graff brand.

The company remains a family business, overseen by Francois Graff, Chief Executive Officer.
 
For Graff, a six-scent collection for women, Lesedi La Rona, debuted exclusively at Harrods beginning in March 2020, which we further extended through 2020 as a result of the mandatory store closings throughout that year. In 2021, a select market rollout began in the Middle East, with limited luxury distribution to only the most exclusive, upmarket retail outlets. In 2021 and 2022, we added two new scents to the Lesedi La Rona collection.

Moncler— In June 2020, we entered into an exclusive, 5-year worldwide license agreement with a potential 5-year extension with Moncler for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the Moncler brand.

Over the years, the brand has combined style with constant technological research assisted by experts in activities linked to the world of the mountain. The Moncler outerwear collections marry the extreme demands of nature with those of city life.
 
Our first fragrance for the Moncler brand has a revolutionary LED design, and the flask-shaped bottles of Moncler Pour Femme and Moncler Pour Homme forge a powerful bond with the House Moncler’s alpine roots and pioneering spirit. This playful and unique innovation enables its owner to write a personalized note that scrolls in red letters on the screen of the mirror bottle. Our first fragrance was pre-launched in 250 select outlets in the second half of 2021, and was met with an excellent response. The rollout to approximately 3,000 doors took place during 2022.

For 2023, extensions for the Montblanc signature scent for women and Explorer line for men are in the pipeline.

Oscar de la Renta— In 2013, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Oscar de la Renta brand. In 2019, the agreement was extended through December 31, 2031, with an additional five-year option potentially extending the agreement through December 31, 2036.

Rochas— In 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter & Gamble Company. Founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925, the brand began as a fashion house and expanded into perfumery in the 1950s under Hélène Rochas’ direction.
 
Our first new fragrance for Rochas, Mademoiselle Rochas, had a successful launch in 2017 in its traditional markets of France and Spain. Over the next few years, we debuted flankers for legacy scents Eau de Rochas and Mademoiselle Rochas, plus others, and in 2018 we launched our first new men’s line, Rochas Moustache.

Business Strategy 
 
Focus on prestige beauty brands. Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company’s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.
 
Grow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing. We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. We regularly create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce seasonal and limited edition fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.
 
Continue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions. Prestige brands are the core of our business, and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past 35 years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, in 2020, we signed a new license for the Moncler brand. We also acquired a minority interest in Divabox, which owns the Origines-parfums online platform. As a website of reference for all selective fragrance brands, Origines-parfums is a key French player in the online beauty market recognized for its customer relationship expertise. This acquisition enhances the introduction of dedicated fragrance lines and products designed to address a specific consumer demand for this distribution channel and accelerate our digital development. During 2021, we closed on a transaction agreement with Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A., whereby an exclusive and worldwide license was granted for the production and distribution of Ferragamo brand perfumes. In 2021, we also entered into a long-term global licensing agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances and fragrance-related products under the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. This exclusive license became effective in July 2022. During 2022, we closed a transaction agreement with Lacoste, whereby an exclusive and worldwide license was granted to Interparfums SA for the production and distribution of Lacoste brand perfumes and cosmetics. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $256 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or outright acquisitions. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.
 
Expand existing portfolio into new categories. We selectively broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs, generate trial and further strengthen customer loyalty.

Continue to build global distribution footprint. Our business is a global business, and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally, we are operating distribution subsidiaries or divisions in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers’ needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.

Suppliers’ accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers’ accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations components for our prestige fragrances are purchased from many suppliers around the world and are primarily manufactured in France.
 
For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are sourced from many suppliers around the world and are primarily manufactured in the United States and Italy. Additionally, we occasionally utilize third party manufacturers in China and Turkey.
 
Environmental, Social & Governance 
 
Both our U.S. operations and our European operations are good corporate citizens and take our responsibilities seriously. We comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in general, and in particular with regard to chemicals and hazardous materials. Throughout our supply chain, from procurement of components to distribution of finished products, we act responsibly and monitor and comply with all legal requirements. While we do not own our manufacturing facilities, we set a high bar with our industrial partners by placing an emphasis on quality, the use of good manufacturing practices and innovation, and encouraging them to build strong ESG programs of their own. Like many of our industry competitors, we are applying a multifunctional and comprehensive approach in addressing the issues of corporate, environmental and social responsibility and transparency, building off the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our European Operations have led the way on this initiative, but our US operations are actively catching up.
European Operations
 
Interparfums SA, our European operations with their headquarters in Paris, has made further progress in the areas of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) based on the results of the 2022 campaign of the rating agency Gaïa Research1 which ranks the top performing companies in this area.
 

Campaign for Fiscal Year | 2020 for Fiscal 2019 | 2021 for Fiscal 2020 | 2022 for Fiscal Year 2021
-------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------------
ESG Rating | 69/100 | 76/100 | 81/100 

 
This score is calculated on the basis of 140 criteria divided into 4 pillars: Environmental, Social, Governance and External Stakeholders.
 
Interparfums SA applies a comprehensive approach in addressing the issues of corporate, environmental and social responsibility and transparency. It has developed from one year to the next its corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) policy, implemented by its Operational and Support Departments by involving all personnel, and has identified issues to be addressed in three key areas: its responsibilities toward operational stakeholders, staff and the company. Social and societal values have been an important component of Interparfums SA’s development for a number of years, exemplified notably by an attractive policy of employee benefits and solid relations with its partners.
 
In October 2022, Interparfums SA announced that it had retained the services of Muriel Buiatti, as its CSR Project Manager to assist the CSR Executive Committee in achieving its goals. A graduate of the French Engineering School, Ecole Polytechnique, Ms. Buiatti exercised various responsibilities, including research and development, at L’Oréal for 13 years. After completing her Master’s Degree in Sustainable Development, she founded Commenterre, which specializes in helping companies address their CSR issues.
 

 Gaïa Research, a member of the EthiFinance Group is an extra-financial rating agency specializing in rating the ESG performance of small and midsize companies and mid-cap companies listed on European markets.

To support its strategy, at the beginning of 2021 and at the initiative of management, Interparfums SA created an CSR Executive Committee, consisting of members of the Operations & Supply Chain, Human Resources, Legal Affairs and Communications teams, tasked with formalizing the company’s CSR strategy focusing on the following priorities, aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals:
 

- | reinforce its status as a responsible employer, by notably creating a “Responsible Employer Charter” and strengthening the employee training plan;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | reduce its environmental footprint, notably by adopting environmentally optimized design specifications to reduce packaging and the introduction of recycled and recyclable materials for each product developed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | strengthen its sustainable development approach by formalizing a code of business conduct and ethics that is enforceable against operational stakeholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental 
 
Interparfums SA does not own its own manufacturing facilities, having chosen to support its industrial partners by placing an emphasis on quality, the use of good manufacturing practices and innovation. The construction of a high quality environmentally certified warehouse in 2011 and sourcing in Europe more than 80% of its needs highlight the efforts undertaken in recent years. In addition, reflecting the stakes in terms of protecting the planet, Interparfums SA now intends to also exercise an increasingly active role in contributing to the environment.
 
As part of its CSR strategy, Interparfums SA has partnered with EcoVadis to assess the CSR performance of its supply chain and suppliers. EcoVadis operates a global platform to assess corporate social responsibility and share performance data using their assessment method based on international CSR standards.
 
In 2022, 119 suppliers were evaluated or were in the process of being evaluated, representing over 68% of Interparfums SA’s procurement activity. As part of a continuous improvement process, Interparfums SA’s objective will be to monitor and encourage the CSR performance of its suppliers in four major areas: the environment, social and human rights, ethics and responsible procurement.
 
EcoVadis assessment results:
 

Number of suppliers evaluated | Average EcoVadis score | Average Environmental score | Average Labor and Human Rights score | Average Ethics score | Average Sustainable Procurement score
------------------------------+------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------------------------------------
91 | 66.7 | 69.5 | 66.9 | 60.7 | 65.3 

 
In addition, in 2022, Interparfums SA has calculated its total carbon footprint in accordance with international standards, and namely the Green House Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) for the conversion of all emission sources into tons of CO equivalent and the Base Carbone®, a public database of emission factors made available by the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME).
 
2021 Carbon footprint: 174,930 tCO2e 


- | 2021 Carbon intensity: 312 KgCO2e per € thousand of revenue (in the low range of our industry)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13

 


In tons CO2 equivalent | 2021 | | Weight
------------------------------------------+------+---------+-------
Scope 1 (gas and fuel energy consumption) | | 226 | | 0,1 | %
Scope 2 (electricity consumption) | | 29 | | 0,0 | %
Scope 3 (other indirect emissions) | | 174,675 | | 99,9 | %
Total | | 174,930 | | 100,0 | %

 


This first measurement is a crucial step before determining a low carbon trajectory in accordance with the European green deal regulation which aims to be climate-neutral by 2050.
 
Moreover, Interparfums SA complies with IS 22716, International Standards for Good Manufacturing Practices, with all aspects of the manufacturing process, including receiving of raw materials and packaging materials, production and quality control. In this regulatory environment, regular audit campaigns are carried out for all packaging plants by the quality department based on the ISO 22716 standard in place. The ultimate purpose of these audits is to ensure that packaging service providers maintain a good level of traceability for their activities. All plant activities were reviewed: receiving process for raw materials and packaging materials, manufacturing, packaging and quality controls. These reports demonstrated that Interparfums SA’s subcontractors comply with ISO 22716 Good Manufacturing Practices and in particular, traceability requirements for all perfume production operations. It is also in compliance with the EU directive entitled Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), which governs and regulates the safe use of chemicals. Although not a manufacturer, per se, Interparfums SA has taken the initiative and monitors its suppliers for compliance with REACH, and has commitments from each of them concerning “Substances of Very High Concern” as listed in appendix XIV of REACH. No supplier of Interparfums SA has advised it of any such hazardous materials in any of its products to date.
 
Interparfums SA monitors the outsourcing of the entire production process of its manufacturing partners with expertise and accountable leadership in their respective areas. These include producers of juice, glass, caps and cardboard boxes and packaging companies. We take environmental issues into account at each of these phases, and in particular regarding the choice of materials used for components, waste management and reducing the carbon footprint. Moreover, all the alcohol used by Interparfums SA is from vegetal origin (essentially from beets).

Contribute | Define the appropriate regenerative agriculture program | One 5 years program defined | | 

Sustainability & The Environment
 
At every stage of the purchasing process, Interparfums SA seeks to determine the precise needs and considers the requirement of limiting sources of unnecessary costs and a waste of resources:

- | reducing waste, in particular at the phases of production, consumption and the end of the product life;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | recycling flawed production, notably at the production phase;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


- | repairing palettes to increase their lifespan.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
Interparfums SA regularly monitors energy and water consumption indicators to assess possibilities for improving energy efficiencies in the area of lighting, heating and air-conditioning for the entire warehousing site, for example by adjusting ventilation flows and using a program that reduces heating and ventilation over weekends.
 
With this objective, measures are planned to automatically turn off lights in the warehouse when employees are taking outside breaks and maintain the warehouse temperature at 11°C (51°Fahrenheit). These energy savings initiatives include measures providing for managing the hours for reloading the electric forklifts during non-peak hours during the night, requiring low consumption for a maximum of 280,000 kW instead of 600,000 kW during the day. Monthly reports on electricity consumption are prepared, allowing the company to analyze the causes for overconsumption, when applicable, in order to take corrective actions as applicable. The measurement of energy consumption highlighted stable levels for electricity and gas over the last four years, whereas water consumption has on average declined marginally. Finally, in the spirit of contributing to protecting the environment, the company has installed parking places at the logistic site for bicycles and electric recharging stations for cars.
 
By strategically locating its warehouse at the crossroads for its subcontractors, Interparfums SA has reduced distances for shipments of finished products.
 
Measures undertaken in collaboration with the warehouse and trade goods shipping manager, within the framework of the improvement and optimization of shipments between production sites and the logistics platform have contributed to reducing the number of back-and-forth trips for trucks.

In the area of transport to distributors, Interparfums SA uses road transport for France and Europe and maritime transport for the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Use of air transport is very limited and reserved only for urgent situations where no other solutions are available. Certain promotional materials manufactured in Asia are shipped directly to American distributors without being imported and stored in France.
 
In addition, in 2018 Interparfums SA put into service a new warehouse located in Singapore to promote the use of short channels within the Asia Pacific region. This warehouse makes it possible to maintain a permanent inventory in this region and, in this way, encourages the use of maritime transport for goods shipped from France to Asia.
 
Measures to prevent environmental risks and pollution involve firstly the choice of techniques and materials.
 
To reduce the impacts of its activities, a water-soluble solution in part biodegradable that does not harm the environment is used in the coloring of some of its bottles. For the remainder of the product lines, the coating process provides for the gradual elimination of solvent-based coatings and the progressive adoption of hydro-coating for all the company’s products, in compliance with the law of 2005 for reducing emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in the air. In addition, certain sub-contractors for glass making have electrostatic air filters to reduce dust and smoke emissions in addition to wastewater recycling.
 
Interparfums SA has, in addition, eliminated thermosetting plastics from its line of bath and body care products in favor of recyclable plastic.
 
To balance product quality and aesthetics with environmental considerations, Interparfums SA takes care to reduce packaging volumes and select the appropriate materials at each stage of production to ensure optimal conditions for their recycling or disposal.
 
The manufacture of recyclable glass bottles includes a system for the recovery, crushing and remolding the waste. Indicators in place since 2013 for tracking wastage have improved Interparfums SA’s ability to monitor wastage rates by glass bottle decorators. Its first objective is to apply a continuous improvement approach and reduce rates of wastage over the long term. The second objective is to succeed in reducing this wastage and reintroduce bottles back into the manufacturing cycle.
 
In addition, Interparfums SA has adopted procedures for recovering waste from subcontractors originating from surplus production or components of discontinued products. The recovered waste is then sorted for the purpose of their elimination.
 
Interparfums SA has also revised the bulk and secondary packaging (product boxes and perfume sets) in order to optimize the palletizing process, reduce the purchase of cardboard packaging materials and reduce volumes transported by decreasing the amount of empty space. The company henceforth requires a minimum number of palettes per truck.
 
Finally, cardboard packaging materials for testers are 100% recyclable.

United States Operations
 
In the U.S. we are also a good corporate citizen. Like our French subsidiary, Interparfums USA also retained Muriel Buiatti to advise and guide us on our path to become a better corporate citizen, as we attempt to increase our efforts in ESG. Also, like our French subsidiary, we are also not a true manufacturer, but we regularly monitor our subcontractors, suppliers and fillers for their compliance. In addition, our subcontractors and fillers are subject to inspection and audit from our various licensors for compliance with all aspects of law.
Environmental
 
In connection with a new product launch in 2023, Hollister Feelin’ Good, this new fragrance highlights our ESG efforts we made in 2022:


● | Glass containing 10% PCR (post-consumer recycled) glass, and is 100% recyclable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our folding cartons meet the requirements of SFI, the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, and are 100% recyclable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Liners are 100% recyclable.
--+----------------------------


● | All components sourced from North/South America – closer supply chain for Hollister brand fragrances and are filled and warehoused in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, all folding cartons for all licensed brands in United States operations now consist of FSC, the Forest Stewardship Council, or SFI certified paper. We are also making efforts to regionally source components to filling and warehousing locations where practicable in order to lessen shipping and thereby lower energy costs. For 2023 most giftsets will be reduced in format and size, and we have eliminated plastic from the following branded gift sets completely, Abercrombie & Fitch, Donna Karan, DKNY, Hollister, MCM and Oscar de la Renta.
 
Our largest filler in the United States has been awarded Bronze status in 2022 from EcoVadis. One of our largest pump manufacturers is the recipient of a 2021 Gold Medal from EcoVadis for Sustainability and a 2020 Bronze Medal from EcoVadis for its corporate social responsibility rating, and a large glass bottle manufacturer was awarded gold metals from EcoVadis for its corporate social responsibility rating two years in a row. In addition in 2021, a large glass bottle manufacturer that we utilize received an “A” rating for leadership in corporate sustainability by CDP, a global environmental non-profit group, ranking ‘A’ for tackling water security and ‘A-’ for leading effort against climate change.
 
In our U.S. operations, we do not use any banned ingredients or components and use sustainable ingredients where practicable. Some componentry (glass/folding cartons) is also recyclable where practicable. For example, our Abercrombie & Fitch Away fragrance uses glass and folding cartons that are 100% recyclable, and the carton liner is 100% recyclable and biodegradable.
 
Lastly, our product development team works with our fragrance houses – all very sustainable in their own right – to incorporate sustainably sourced ingredients in the fragrance oils used.

In addition to our production operations complying with applicable law, our managers, supervisors and traffic coordinators in our New Jersey distribution center undergo training in order for us to comply with Dangerous Goods Regulations. Compliance requires training and certification to deal in hazardous materials to prevent damage to the environment. The two main certifications are:
 
International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Dangerous Goods Training – 3 year Certification for Ocean Shipment and International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Training – 2 year Certification for Global Air Shipments.
 
Further, our distribution center in New Jersey has in-rack sprinklers to accommodate our hazardous material products. Our fragrances, Class 9 – Consumer Commodity ID8000, are registered with American Chemistry Council, Inc. (known in the chemicals industry as Chemtrec). Chemtrec has a 24/7 hazardous materials emergency communications center, which provides immediate assistance for incidents involving hazardous materials of any kind.

As we continue in our endeavors of responsible employment, corporate citizenship and governance practices, and continue to elevate the issue of environmental responsibility, we will update our policies and procedures accordingly. As such, this Ethical Code of Conduct will be updated from time to time.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Our products are distributed in over 120 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For our international distribution, we either contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods or distribute prestige products through our distribution subsidiaries. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.
 
As our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For the distribution of brands within our European based operations, we operate through our distribution subsidiaries or divisions in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 120 countries around the world.
 
Over 50% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.
 
The business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our distribution subsidiaries and divisions to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.
 
For our United States operations, we distribute products to retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in-house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.
 
Competition
 
The market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names.

Inventory
 
We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally ship products to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers or directly to one of those third party fillers, which manufacture the finished products for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.
Product Liability
 
Our United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $10.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of €20 million (approximately $21 million). Based on our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims.
Government Regulation
 
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, fragrance products are regulated as cosmetics, and fragrances include perfumes, colognes and aftershave. They must meet the same requirements for safety as other cosmetic ingredients. Compliance required of fragrance ingredients include being safe for consumers when they are used according to labeled directions or as consumers customarily use them.
 
Under the Fair Packaging and Labelling Act, companies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics have the legal responsibility to ensure the products are safe and labelled according to the Act.
 
Our fragrance products that are manufactured and marketed in Europe are also regulated as cosmetics and subject to EU Regulation 1223/2009, and after Brexit, the United Kingdom regulation of The UK Schedule 34 to the Product Safety and Metrology Regulation 2019. As of the date of this report, IP products are in compliance with these regulations.
 
Trademarks
 
The market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection are important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.
 
Under various licenses and other agreements, we have the right to use certain registered trademarks throughout the world for fragrance products. These registered trademarks include:
 

● | Abercrombie & Fitch
--+--------------------


● | Anna Sui
--+---------


● | bebe
--+-----

United States Operations
 
Our employees are one of our most valuable assets, and fostering long-term relationships are beneficial to the continuity of our business. After experience and expertise in the respective fields of employment, we look for dedication and loyalty among our employees, as we believe having long-term staff members benefits our Company. All of our executive senior officers have been with us for more than twenty years (other than our CFO who just joined our company in September 2022), and we have several senior and upper-level staff members, who have also been with us long-term. These long-term executives and employees believe that our Company and their co-workers are an extended family and share the same values of entrepreneurship, commitment, creativity and passion. Their efforts and dedication are what allow our Company to prosper.
 
Every year, United States operations organizes two seminars over several days for all its global sales staff. This seminar provides an opportunity to present all the Company’s brands and products and marketing strategies.
 
The safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced brief closures at all of our locations, and adapted to working remotely. Upon reopening, we implemented prevention protocols to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces. These protocols, which remain in place, are in compliance with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and state requirements.
 
As part of our increasing benefits of working at our United States operations, we provide a comprehensive benefits package (medical, dental, vision, long-term disability, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and life insurance, 401-K, commuter benefits), allow Friday remote working arrangements for our employees, have shorter hours on Fridays during the summer months, offer various gifts and “goodie bags” during various times of the year, have made available food choices for purchase in our lunchroom in New York from the “Fraîche fridge,” and hold quarterly presentations showing financial results, updates on all departments, existing product lines, as well as the development and launches of new products for all of our brands for all employees and consultants worldwide of United States operations so that all are made aware of our operations, and invite comments from those in attendance at the presentations.

European Operations
 
Interparfums SA’s employees constitute its most important contributor for creating value. For that reason, their professional fulfillment and motivation are indispensable drivers for our development.
 
With a family-style management culture that is close to its employees, everyone is free to share their ideas in a manner that respects the company’s values. Management attaches great importance to ensuring that each employee fully understands and supports Interparfums SA’s strategy.
 
Through weekly memos and regular information meetings on business developments and trends, employees are kept up-to-date on expectations of management and the market. The organization’s flexibility largely made up of small teams facilitates its continuous adaptation to all changes or evolving external conditions.
 
This sharing of the “Interparfums” spirit, also entails a commitment to and understanding of its ethical values by each employee, the fulfillment of employees at work and compliance with good working conditions. This ethical commitment is formalized by a “Code of Good Conduct” to which each employee subscribes, and that is focused in particular on health, safety, discipline, risk management, preventing harassment, respecting individual freedoms, sensitive transactions, fraud and business confidentiality.
 
In 2017, Interparfums SA adopted a Charter relating to the right to disconnect from digital devices that was accepted by each employee.
 
Every two to three years, Interparfums SA organizes a seminar over several days for all its distributors from throughout the world. This seminar provides an opportunity to present all the company’s brands and products, meet with all distributors and involve them in Interparfums SA’s development while giving the distributors an opportunity to meet with staff with whom they work closely on a daily basis.
 
The Human Resources Department pays particular attention to ensuring equal opportunity and non-discrimination for each recruitment. Only skills, experience, qualifications and the personality of the candidates are taken into account in the selection process for new employees. This diversity in terms of profiles, culture, age and gender constitutes a decisive strength of its teams, the company’s most important asset.
 
27

 

Women account for 72% of Interparfums’ workforce and 52% of management positions are occupied by women in 2021.
 
Since 2019, Interparfums SA has organized an annual disability awareness raising campaign. In 2021, employees were given an opportunity to participate role-playing workshop designed to give them a first-hand perspective of a person with a disability (hearing, visual, psychological, motor). Thanks to these opportunities for exchange, employees were able to talk about their all possible impediments and share their views and experiences.
 
Through these awareness-raising campaigns and local support from the Human Resources teams, two employees were accorded the status of employees with disabilities through a specific procedure available in France for that purpose (Reconnaissance de la Qualité de Travailleur Handicapé or RQTH).
 
Interparfums SA also participates indirectly in promoting the employment of persons with disabilities and combating exclusion discrimination. The company has chosen to use a sheltered work enterprise to package its perfume boxes and a global communications agency called “Les Papillons de Jour” to organize the European Week for the Employment of People with Disabilities (EWPD).
 
In 2021, the total cost for these services amounted to €974,094.
 
In addition, Interparfums SA has adopted action plans promoting the employment of seniors and equal opportunity between men and women.
 
Compensation and wage increases
 
Interparfums SA has a compensation policy as well as a system of job classifications and performance evaluations applied to all employees. These procedures guarantee the principle of fairness as well as equal treatment of men and women employees. All employees benefit from a combination of fixed and variable incentive compensation benefits linked to Interparfums SA’s performance.
 
Profit-sharing
 
As required by French law, a statutory employee profit-sharing agreement was implemented in 2001. In April 2015, this agreement was amended to provide more advantageous terms to employees, representing an important component of compensation and motivation for all staff and reviewed every year.
 
Savings plan and pension plan
 
All employees of Interparfums SA benefit from a company savings plan which proposes several types of funds corresponding to the specific projects of each. Since 2017, it has adapted its plan by proposing an Interparfums stock ownership fund allowing employees to take advantage of the growth of Interparfums’ shares under favorable tax conditions. The amounts employees pay into this fund are supplemented by an important contribution by the company.
 
In addition, a group retirement savings plan (Plan d’Epargne Retraite Collectif or PERCOL) is available to employees as a vehicle for preparing for their retirement and to which the company contributes significantly. Employees also can transfer a portion of their unused annual vacation days into the Interparfums SA retirement savings plan.
 
Supplemental defined contribution retirement plan contract (Article 83)
 
Management employees benefit from a supplemental defined-contribution retirement plan. Participation in this plan is mandatory. This individual plan is funded by monthly employee and employer contributions, with the breakdown of these latter contributions freely determined. Interparfums SA has decided to assist its employees in financing this supplemental retirement benefit, by assuming an important percentage of these contributions itself.
