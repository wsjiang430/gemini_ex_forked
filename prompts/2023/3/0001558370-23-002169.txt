Item 1. Business
Marine Products manufactures fiberglass motorized boats distributed and marketed through its independent dealer network. Marine Products’ product offerings include Chaparral sterndrive and outboard pleasure boats and Robalo outboard sport fishing boats.
Organization and Overview
Marine Products is a Delaware corporation incorporated on August 31, 2000, in connection with a spin-off from RPC, Inc. (NYSE: RES) (“RPC”). Effective February 28, 2001, RPC accomplished the spin-off by contributing 100 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of Chaparral to Marine Products, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of RPC, and then distributing the common stock of Marine Products to RPC stockholders.
Marine Products designs, manufactures and sells recreational fiberglass powerboats in the sportboat and sport fishing boat markets. The Company sells its products to a network of 210 domestic and 88 international independent authorized dealers. Marine Products’ mission is to enhance its customers’ boating experience by providing them with high quality, innovative powerboats. The Company intends to remain a leading manufacturer of recreational powerboats for sale to a broad range of consumers worldwide.
Chaparral was founded in 1965 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Chaparral’s first boat was a 15-foot tri-hull design with a retail price of less than $1,000. Over time Chaparral grew by offering exceptional quality and consumer value. In 1976, Chaparral moved to Nashville, Georgia, where a manufacturing facility of a former boat manufacturing company was available for purchase. This provided Chaparral an opportunity to obtain additional manufacturing space and access to a trained workforce. With over 57 years of

boatbuilding experience, Chaparral continues to expand the range of its offerings through insightful, innovative product design and quality manufacturing processes in order to reach an increasingly discerning recreational boating market.
The Company manufactures Chaparral sterndrive pleasure boats including SSi and SSX models, and the Chaparral Surf Series. The Company also manufactures Chaparral outboard pleasure boats which include OSX Luxury Sportboats and SSi outboard models.
In addition to the outboard models manufactured by Chaparral, the Company also manufactures Robalo outboard sport fishing boats. Robalo was founded in 1969 and its first boat was a 19-foot center console salt-water fishing boat, among the first of this type of boat to have an “unsinkable” hull. The models manufactured under the Robalo name include center consoles, dual consoles and Cayman Bay Boats. 
The most recent available industry statistics [source: Statistical Surveys, Inc. report dated September 30, 2022] indicate that Robalo is the third largest manufacturer of outboard boats in lengths from 18 to 36 feet in the United States with a market share of 4.2 percent. Additionally, the combination of Robalo and Chaparral outboards holds the second highest position in the outboard market of this size range, with a market share of 5.4 percent. 
​
Products
Marine Products distinguishes itself by offering a wide range of products to the family recreational markets through its Chaparral brands and to the sport fishing market through its Robalo brands.

Manufacturing
Marine Products’ manufacturing facilities are in Nashville, Georgia. Marine Products utilizes five different plants to, among other things, manufacture interiors, design new models, create fiberglass hulls and decks, and assemble various end products. Quality control is conducted throughout the manufacturing process. When fully assembled and inspected, the boats are loaded onto either Company-owned trailers or third-party marine transport trailers for delivery to dealers. The manufacturing process begins with the design of a product to meet dealer and customer needs. Plugs are constructed in the research and development phase from designs. Plugs are used to create a mold from which prototype boats can be built. Adjustments are made to the plug design until acceptable parameters are met. The final plug is used to create the necessary number of production molds. Molds are used to produce the fiberglass hulls and decks. Fiberglass components are made by applying the outside finish or gel coat to the mold, then numerous layers of fiberglass and resin are applied during the lamination process over the gel coat. After curing, the hull and deck are removed from the molds and are trimmed and prepared for final assembly, which includes the installation of electrical and plumbing systems, engines, upholstery, accessories and graphics.
Product Warranty
For our Chaparral and Robalo products, Marine Products provides a lifetime limited structural hull warranty and a transferable one-year limited warranty to the original owner. Chaparral also includes a five-year limited structural deck warranty. Warranties for additional items are provided for periods of one to five years and are not transferrable. Additionally, as it relates to the first subsequent owner, a five-year transferrable hull warranty and the remainder of the original one-year limited warranty on certain components are available. The five-year transferable hull warranty terminates five years after the date of the original retail purchase. Claim costs related to components are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer.
The manufacturers of the engines, generators, and navigation electronics included on our boats provide and administer their own warranties for various lengths of time.
Suppliers
Marine Products’ three most significant cost components used in manufacturing its boats are engines, resins and fiberglass. For each of these, there is currently an adequate supply available in the market. During the period beginning in the second quarter of 2020, at various times Marine Products experienced significant shortages in, and delayed shipments of, several of these raw materials and component parts used in manufacturing its products. These shortages have reduced our ability to meet the existing levels of dealer and consumer demand and have also increased working capital requirements during this period. During the third and fourth quarters of 2022, however, many of these shortages or delays began to ease, which allowed Marine Products to complete and ship more boats. As a result, unit sales during the fourth quarter of 2022 were the highest of any quarter during the year, and working capital requirements began to decline as well. 
Marine Products does not manufacture the engines installed in its boats. Engines are generally specified by the dealers at the time of ordering a boat, usually based on anticipated customer preferences or actual customer orders. Sterndrive engines are purchased through the American Boatbuilders Association (“ABA”), which has entered into engine supply arrangements with Mercury Marine and Volvo Penta, the two currently existing suppliers of sterndrive engines. These arrangements contain incentives and discount provisions, which may reduce the cost of the engines purchased, if specified purchase volumes are met during specified periods of time. Although no minimum purchases are required, Marine Products expects to continue purchasing sterndrive engines through the ABA on a voluntary basis in order to receive volume-based purchase discounts. Marine Products does not have a long-term supply contract with the ABA. Marine Products has outboard engine supply contracts with Yamaha and Mercury Marine which were not negotiated through the ABA. In the event of a sudden and extended interruption in the supply of engines from any of these suppliers, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted. See “Risk Factors” below.
Marine Products uses other raw materials in its manufacturing processes. Among these are resins, made from hydrocarbon feedstocks, as well as copper and steel. The costs of these commodities fluctuate in response to changes in global economic conditions.

Sales and Distribution
Domestic sales are generated through our independent dealer network of approximately 73 Chaparral dealers, 47 Robalo dealers and 90 dealers that sell both brands located in markets throughout the United States. Marine Products also has 88 international dealers. Most of our dealers also inventory and sell boat brands manufactured by other companies, including some that compete directly with our brands. The territories served by any dealer are not exclusive to the dealer; however, Marine Products uses discretion in establishing relationships with new dealers in an effort to protect the mutual interests of the existing dealers and the Company. Marine Products’ six independent field sales representatives call upon existing dealers and develop new dealer relationships. The field sales representatives are directed by a National Sales Coordinator, who is responsible for developing the dealer distribution network for the Company’s products. No single dealer accounted for 10 percent or more of net sales during 2022, 2021 or 2020. The marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer. Marine Products supports dealer marketing efforts by supplementing local advertising, sales and marketing follow up in boating magazines, and participation in selected regional, national, and international boat show exhibitions. In addition, Marine Products has developed virtual marketing programs which include online product demonstrations and virtual reality software and hardware which promote the features of its products. The Company’s virtual marketing efforts have become increasingly important beginning in 2020, when social distancing requirements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic limited customer interaction at boat dealers’ facilities and reduced in-person boat shows during the winter boat show season. 
Marine Products continues to seek new dealers in many areas throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. In general, Marine Products requires full payment in U.S. dollars prior to shipping a boat overseas. Consequently, there is no credit risk associated with these international sales or risk related to foreign currency fluctuation. The Company’s international sales are affected by trends in consumer discretionary spending and the value of the U.S. dollar on global currency markets, among other things. During 2022, the Company’s international net sales increased 61.2 percent compared to 2021 despite the impact of trade tariffs enacted during 2018, most notably in Mexico and the European Union which was lifted during the second quarter of 2022. International net sales as a percentage of total net sales were 6.7 percent in 2022, 5.3 percent in 2021, and 4.9 percent in 2020.
Marine Products’ sales orders are indicators of strong interest from its dealers. Historically, dealers have in most cases taken delivery of all their orders. In a typical ordering, production and delivery cycle, the Company monitors dealer inventory levels in order to inform its production scheduling and to ensure that dealers do not hold excess inventory. During 2021 and 2022, however, extraordinarily high dealer and consumer demand combined with the Company’s production delays caused by supply chain disruptions have caused dealer inventories to fall to historic lows. The combination of low inventory levels and continued high demand has forced the Company to allocate its production to dealers to fulfill as many orders as possible and rebuild dealer inventories to levels that both the Company and its dealers believe to be appropriate. Marine Products believes that this allocation of production will continue during 2023. In the past, Marine Products has been able to resell any boat for which an order has been cancelled and believes that this ability will continue during the near term.
Approximately 58 percent of Marine Products’ domestic shipments are made pursuant to “floor plan financing” programs in which Marine Products’ subsidiaries participate on behalf of their dealers with major third-party financing institutions. The remaining dealers finance their boat inventory with smaller regional financial institutions in local markets or self-finance. Under these established arrangements with qualified lending institutions, a dealer establishes a line of credit with one or more of these lenders for the purchase of boat inventory for sales to retail customers in their showroom or during boat show exhibitions. In general, when a dealer purchases and takes delivery of a boat pursuant to a floor plan financing arrangement, it draws against its line of credit and the lender pays the invoice cost of the boat directly to Marine Products generally within ten business days. When the dealer in turn sells the boat to a retail customer, the dealer repays the lender, thereby restoring its available credit line. Each dealer’s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer’s inventory, letters of credit, and perhaps other personal and real property. In connection with a dealer’s floor plan financing arrangements with a qualified lending institution, Marine Products or its subsidiaries have agreed to repurchase inventory which the lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to Marine Products in a “new and unused” condition subject to normal wear and tear, as defined. The contractual agreements that Marine Products or its subsidiaries have with these qualified lenders contain the Company’s assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on repossessed boats, up to certain contractually determined dollar limits negotiated with the lender.

​

The Company currently has an agreement with one of the floor plan lenders whereby the contractual repurchase limit, subject to a minimum of $8.0 million, is based on a specified percentage of the amount of the average net receivables financed by the floor plan lender for our dealers less repurchases during the prior 12 month period, which was a repurchase limit of $8.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation of $4.3 million, with various expiration and cancellation terms of less than one year. Accordingly, the aggregate repurchase obligation with all financing institutions was approximately $12.3 million as of December 31, 2022. In the event that a dealer defaults on a credit line, the qualified lender may then invoke the manufacturer’s repurchase obligation with respect to that dealer. In that event, all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted. Unlike Marine Products’ obligation to repurchase boats repossessed by qualified lenders, Marine Products is under no obligation to repurchase boats directly from dealers. Marine Products does not sponsor financing programs to the retail consumer; any consumer financing promotions for a prospective boat purchaser would be the responsibility of the dealer. 
Marine Products’ dealer sales incentive programs are generally designed to promote early replenishment of the stock in dealer inventories depleted throughout the prime spring and summer selling seasons, and to promote the sales of older models in dealer inventory and particular models during specified periods. These programs help to stabilize Marine Products’ manufacturing between the peak and off-peak periods and promote sales of certain models. For the 2023 model year (which commenced July 1, 2022), Marine Products offered its dealers several sales incentive programs based on dollar volume and timing of dealer purchases. Program incentives offered include sales discounts and payment of floor plan financing interest charged by qualified floor plan lenders to dealers generally through April 30, 2023. After the interest payment programs end, interest costs revert to the dealer at rates set by the lender. A dealer makes periodic curtailment payments (principal payments) on outstanding obligations against its dealer inventory as set forth in the floor plan financing agreements between the dealer and its particular lender. 
We do not believe that dealer inventories of our boat models as of December 31, 2022 are sufficient to meet the current level of retail customer demand. The sales order backlog as of December 31, 2022 was 1,544 boats with estimated net sales of approximately $115.0 million. This represents an approximate 16.6 week backlog based on recent production levels. The sales order backlog as of December 31, 2021 was 2,457 boats with estimated net sales of approximately $166.0 million. This represented an approximate 30.0 week backlog based on production levels at that time. The Company’s backlog measured in weeks at December 31, 2022 was less meaningful than in past periods because the Company is allocating its productions to its dealers rather than manufacturing boats in response to dealer orders as has been its past practice. The Company will continue to monitor the number of boats in dealer inventories and adjust its production levels as it deems necessary to manage dealer inventory levels. Due to the high retail demand, over 96 percent of our boats have been in dealer inventory less than 12 months as of December 31, 2022. The Company typically does not manufacture a significant number of boats for its own inventory. The Company occasionally manufactures boats for its own inventory because the number of boats required for immediate shipment is not always the most efficient number of boats to produce in a given production schedule. 
Research and Development
Essentially the same technologies and processes are used to produce fiberglass boats by all boat manufacturers. The most common method to build fiberglass boats is with open-face molding. This is usually a labor-intensive, manual process whereby employees hand spray and apply fiberglass and resin in layers on open molds to create boat hulls, decks and other smaller fiberglass components. A single open-face mold is typically capable of producing approximately three hulls per week.
Marine Products has been a leading innovator in the recreational boating industry. One of the Company’s most innovative designs is the full-length “Extended V-Plane” running surface on its Chaparral boat models. Typically, sterndrive boats have a several foot gap on the bottom rear of the hull where the engine enters the water. With the Extended V-Plane, the running surface extends the full length to the rear of the boat. The benefit of this innovation is more deck space, better planing performance and a more comfortable ride. Although the basic hull designs are similar, the Company has historically introduced a variety of new models each year and periodically replaces, updates or discontinues existing models.
Another hull design is the Hydro LiftTM used on the Robalo boat models. This variable dead rise hull design provides a smooth ride in rough water conditions. It increases the maximum speed obtainable by a given engine horsepower and weight of the boat. Robalo’s current models utilize the Hydro LiftTM design and we plan to continue to provide this design on Robalo models.

In support of its new product development efforts, Marine Products incurred research and development costs of $437 thousand in 2022, $776 thousand in 2021, and $751 thousand in 2020.
Industry Overview
The recreational marine market in the United States is a mature market, with 2021 retail expenditures of approximately $57 billion spent on new and used boats, motors and engines, trailers, accessories and other associated costs as estimated by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (“NMMA”). Pleasure boats compete with all other leisure activities for consumers’ limited free time.
There are currently approximately 12 million recreational boats owned in the United States, including outboard, inboard, sterndrive, jet drive, sailboats and personal watercraft. Marine Products competes in the sterndrive boating category with three lines of Chaparral boats and in the outboard category with its Robalo sport fishing boats, Chaparral OSX Sport Luxury, and selected Chaparral SSi models. Management believes that the five largest states for boat sales at the present time are Florida, Texas, Michigan, North Carolina and Minnesota. Marine Products has dealers in each of these states. 
Industry retail sales of new outboard boats in the United States during 2022 totaled 47,099 units and accounted for approximately 71 percent of the total new fiberglass powerboats sold between 18 and 36 feet in hull length. Retail sales of new outboard boats had an estimated total retail value of $3.7 billion, with an average retail price per unit of approximately $79,000. Approximately 58 percent of the Company’s unit sales to dealers in 2022 were outboard boats compared to 62 percent in 2021. Retail sales of new sterndrive boats in the United States during 2022 totaled 6,552 units and accounted for approximately 10 percent of the total new fiberglass powerboats sold in the 21 to 34 feet hull length. Retail sales of new sterndrive boats had an estimated total retail value of $880 million, with an average retail price per unit of approximately $134,000. Approximately 42 percent of the Company’s unit sales to dealers in 2022 were sterndrive boats compared to 38 percent in 2021. 
The table below reflects the estimated annual sales within the recreational marine market segment by category for 2022 and 2021 (source: Info-Link Technologies, Inc.):

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

​
Chaparral’s products are categorized as sterndrive boats and outboard boats, and Robalo’s products are categorized as outboard boats. Industry-wide sterndrive boat unit sales have declined steadily during the last three years. 
The recreational boat manufacturing market remains highly fragmented, although several large public companies own, or have started to acquire, a diversified group of recreational boat manufacturers. We estimate that the boat manufacturing industry includes fewer than 20 sterndrive manufacturers and approximately 75 outboard boat manufacturers with significant unit production, with a large number representing small, privately held companies with varying degrees of professional management and manufacturing skill. According to estimates provided by Statistical Surveys, Inc., during the latest reported period ended September 30, 2022, the top five outboard model manufacturers, which include Marine Products Corporation’s Robalo brands, have a combined market share of approximately 24 percent, compared to 28 percent during the same period in the prior year. Also according to Statistical Surveys, Inc., the top five sterndrive model manufacturers, –– which includes Chaparral, have a combined market share of approximately 74 percent, the same as during the same period in the prior year. Chaparral’s market share in sterndrive units during this period was approximately 19.8 percent, a slight increase compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Several factors influence sales trends in the recreational boating industry, including general economic growth, consumer confidence, household incomes, the availability and cost of financing for our dealers and customers, weather, fuel prices, tax laws, demographics and consumers’ leisure time. As noted elsewhere, consumer demand began to increase significantly during the second quarter of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged American consumers to seek safe outdoor activities involving a limited number of people. Also, the value of residential and vacation real estate in coastal and recreational areas influences recreational boat sales. The most recent NMMA surveys indicate that many past boating participants do not currently participate in boating because of

​

high costs and a lack of leisure time. The increases in the cost of certain components, international tariffs, operating costs, and the impact of environmental regulation have increased the cost of boats and boat ownership in recent years, and these trends may continue. Competition from other leisure and recreational activities for available leisure time can also affect sales of recreational boats.
Management believes Marine Products is well positioned to take advantage of the following conditions, which continue to characterize the industry:

● | labor-intensive manufacturing processes that remain largely unautomated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increasingly strict environmental standards derived from governmental regulations and customer sensitivities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a lack of focus on coordinated customer service and support by dealers and manufacturers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a lack of financial strength among retail boat dealers and many manufacturers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Strategies
Recreational boating is a mature industry. According to Info-Link Technologies, Inc., retail sales of new powerboats of all types decreased at a compounded annual rate of approximately 2.3 percent between 2018 and 2022. During this period, Marine Products experienced a compounded annual decline rate of approximately 5.1 percent in the number of boats sold. The Company has historically grown its boat sales and net sales primarily through increasing market share and by expanding its number of models and product lines. At the end of 2022, the Company’s dealer inventories were approximately 70.0 percent higher than they were at the end of 2021, and our unit order backlog was 37.2 percent lower than it was at the end of 2021. In spite of high retail and dealer demand, and historically low dealer inventories, our unit order backlog is lower at the end of 2022 than at the end of 2021 because current supply chain issues prevent us from forecasting our production accurately during the near term. We believe that dealer inventories are not sufficient to meet retail demand during the 2023 retail selling season. Chaparral has grown its sterndrive market share in its size category from 5.9 percent in fiscal 1996 to 19.8 percent during the latest reported period ended September 30, 2022 (the most recent information available to us from Statistical Surveys, Inc.). 
During 2022, Marine Products generated its highest unit sales volume to dealers within two of Chaparral’s sterndrive SSI models. In general, our model mix during 2022 shifted to larger boats, which generate higher average selling prices.
Our high-volume models support Marine Products’ overall operating strategy, which emphasizes innovative designs and manufacturing processes, and the production of a high-quality product, while also seeking to lower manufacturing costs through increased efficiencies in our facilities. In addition, we seek opportunities to leverage our buying power through economies of scale. Management believes its membership in the ABA positions Marine Products as a significant third-party customer of major suppliers of sterndrive engines. Marine Products’ Chaparral subsidiary is a founding member of the ABA, which collectively represents 23 independent boat manufacturers that have formed a buying group to pool their purchasing power to achieve improved pricing on engines, fiberglass, resin and many other components. Marine Products intends to continue seeking the most advantageous purchasing arrangements from its suppliers.
Our marketing strategy seeks to increase market share by enabling Marine Products to expand its presence by building dedicated sales, marketing and distribution systems. Marine Products has a distribution network of 298 independent dealers located throughout the United States and in several international markets. Our strategy is to increase selectively the quantity of our dealers, and to improve the quality and effectiveness of our entire dealer network. Marine Products seeks to capitalize on its strong dealer network by educating its dealers on the sales and servicing of our products and helping them provide more comprehensive customer service, with the goal of increasing customer satisfaction, customer retention and future sales. Marine Products provides promotional and incentive programs to help its dealers increase product sales and customer satisfaction. During 2022 we continued to develop our nationally advertised fixed retail pricing strategy. We believe the nationally advertised fixed retail pricing gives the consumer confidence that that they are getting the best possible price resulting in higher customer satisfaction and encourages consistent pricing across our dealer network. Marine Products also realizes that innovative marketing is an increasingly important component of the full customer experience and is leading the way with marketing and branding that consistently present a luxury-oriented message that integrate themselves into the boater’s entire experience.

​

A component of Marine Products’ overall strategy is to consider making strategic acquisitions which complement existing product lines, expand its geographic presence in the marketplace and strengthen its capabilities depending upon availability, price and complementary product lines. We periodically review potential acquisition targets. 
Competition
The recreational boat industry is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers, dealers and boat show exhibition space. There is significant competition both within markets we currently serve and in new markets that we may enter. Marine Products’ brands compete with several large national or regional manufacturers that have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. However, we believe that our corporate infrastructure and marketing and sales capabilities, in addition to our financial strength, and our nationwide presence, enable us to compete effectively against these companies. In each of our markets, Marine Products competes on the basis of responsiveness to customer needs, the quality and range of models offered, and the competitive pricing of those models. Additionally, Marine Products faces general competition from all other recreational businesses seeking to attract consumers’ leisure time and discretionary spending dollars.
According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., the following is a list of the top ten (largest to smallest) outboard boat manufacturers in the United States based on retail unit sales in 2022. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., the companies set forth below represent approximately 47 percent of all United States retail outboard boat registrations with hull lengths of 18 to 36 feet for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2022 (latest data available to us).

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Certain materials used in boat manufacturing, including the resins used to make the decks and hulls, are toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state pollution control agencies, which require reports and facility inspections to monitor compliance with their regulations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards limit the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Marine Products’ manufacturing facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. Marine Products believes that its facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. We do not currently anticipate that any material expenditure will be required to continue to comply with existing environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities.

​

Recreational powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be compliant with the International Organization for Standardization requirements which specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. All boats sold by Marine Products meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971. The Boat Safety Act requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. Marine Products has from time to time instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by other manufacturers. None of the recalls has had a material adverse effect on Marine Products.
The EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet an air emission standard that requires fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. These regulations also require, among other things, that the engine manufacturer provide a warranty that the engine meets EPA emission standards. The engines used in Marine Products’ Chaparral and Robalo product lines are subject to these regulations. These regulations are similar to regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board in 2007 but apply to all U.S. states and territories. This regulation has increased the cost to manufacture the majority of the Company’s boat products. Compliance with these EPA regulations has increased Marine Products’ cost and may also reduce Marine Products’ net sales, because the increased cost of owning a boat may force consumers to buy a smaller or less expensive boat.

The recreational boating industry is cyclical and therefore headcount is subject to change based on production levels which are a function of dealer and consumer demand. The Company’s key human capital management objectives are focused on fostering talent in the following areas:
Diversity and Equality - The Company’s workforce reflects the diversity of the community in which it operates. Our dedicated team of employees work toward a common purpose. We provide employment in a small community which we have supported as the largest employer since 1976 under the same management. Our company is strong in its values, relationships and consistency in management. The Board of Directors has a human capital and compensation committee that, among other things, monitors compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws related to race, gender and other protected classes. The Committee provides quarterly reports to the Board, including discussion of any significant compliance matters.
Development and Training - The Company’s management team and all its employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. We have implemented and maintained a corporate compliance program to provide guidance for everyone associated with the Company, including its employees, officers and directors (the “Code”). Annual review of the Code is required, and the Code prohibits unlawful or unethical activity, including discrimination, and directs our employees, officers, and directors to avoid actions that, even if not unlawful or unethical, might create an appearance of illegality or impropriety. In addition, the Company provides annual training for preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination.
Employee Retention - Marine Products monitors voluntary employee turnover and reports these statistics to senior operational management. From time to time, the Company has rewarded employee tenure through various bonus programs for its hourly employees based on attendance and job performance. 
Compensation and Benefits - The Company focuses on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefit packages that are competitive in the market, taking into account the location and responsibilities of the job. We provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match, and generally grant awards of restricted stock for certain of our salaried employees.
The Company provides a health insurance option that includes a local primary physician who provides immediate care or medical consultation to its employees at reduced or no cost, as well as certain maintenance medications at reduced or no cost. Under this program, an employee with a health concern visits the physician’s office, which is close to our manufacturing facility, and either

receives care or is referred to another facility for testing or additional care. We believe that this program improves employee well-being by facilitating their access to health care.
Safety - Marine Products monitors several safety measures and reports them to senior operational management on a regular basis. Management reviews safety incidents, and the Company works to remediate operational issues that may be potential causes of any frequent incidents. In addition, the Company awards safety bonuses to the drivers of its company-owned vehicles based on their driving records. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Marine Products temporarily suspended manufacturing operations for five weeks at the end of the first quarter of 2020, out of concern for the well-being of its employees and their families, and at the recommendation of local and state authorities. The Company also coordinated testing for employees at a local physician’s office. The Company has since resumed operations and implemented additional safety measures for its employees including providing face masks and hand sanitizer as well as social distancing where possible. The Company encourages vaccinations and has created opportunities for employees to conveniently receive vaccinations at their job site. 
Proprietary Matters
Marine Products owns several trademarks, trade names and patents that it believes are important to its business. Except for the Chaparral and Robalo trademarks, however, Marine Products is not dependent upon any single trademark or trade name or group of trademarks or trade names. The Chaparral and Robalo trademarks are currently registered in the United States. The current duration for such registration ranges from seven to 15 years but each registration may be renewed an unlimited number of times.
Seasonality
Marine Products’ quarterly operating results are affected by weather and general economic conditions. Quarterly operating results for the second quarter traditionally record the highest sales volume for the year because this corresponds with the highest retail sales volume period. For similar reasons, quarterly operating results for the fourth quarter often record the lowest sales volume for the year. However, in 2020 Marine Products recorded the lowest quarterly sales volume of the year in the second quarter because of our temporary production facility closure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the highest sales volume of the year in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to high retail demand which extended beyond the traditional retail selling season for recreational boats. Marine Products did not experience traditional seasonal sales patterns during 2021 and 2022 because retail customers were concerned about low dealer inventories and were willing to purchase a boat outside of the typical boating season. In addition, Marine Products recorded the highest quarterly sales volume of 2022 during the fourth quarter due to improvement in our supply chain and transportation availability. Boat demand remained very high throughout 2021 and 2022 and we believe that these consumer behaviors will continue in 2023. The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period.
Inflation
During 2021 and 2022, inflation in the general economy has increased to its highest level in more than 40 years due to economic growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages and U.S. fiscal policy. As a result, the market prices of the raw materials used by the Company’s manufacturing processes increased during these periods. In addition, the Company purchases components of which there are a limited number of suppliers, most of whom are experiencing significant customer orders impacting their ability to provide needed supply quantities. The costs of most of these components increased as demand from recreational boat manufacturers has increased and supply chains have remained constrained. These cost increases are exacerbated by higher transportation costs, which are included in the total cost of these components. In response to historically high consumer demand as well as higher raw materials and components costs, the Company increased the prices for its products periodically beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing through the beginning of the 2023 model year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the prices of many raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing processes began to decline, and transportation became more available and less expensive, thus easing the Company’s cost pressures. As of the end of 2022, the Company’s price increases during this period have had no discernible impact on the Company’s sales due to high consumer demand and strong order backlogs, so they have allowed Marine Products to maintain its profit margins. However, if in the future the Company is forced to raise the prices of its products due to increased raw materials and component costs, it may not be able to continue to pass these increased costs along to dealers and consumers, which could impact the Company’s profit margins. Furthermore, such higher product prices may compel consumers to choose smaller boats, boats with fewer features or delay the purchase of a boat altogether.

New boat buyers typically finance their purchases. Higher inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. The Company believes that the recent increases in interest rates creates a risk to retail demand for recreational boats. However, we do not believe that this risk will impact production and sales in the near future due to other factors, such as historically low dealer inventories, high dealer order backlog, and indications of consumer demand that extend into the 2023 retail selling season.
