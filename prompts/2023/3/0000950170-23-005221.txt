 Item 1. Business.
 General
 Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., incorporated in Delaware in 1989, provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a fleet of 14 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of four owned drillships, eight owned semisubmersible rigs and two managed rigs. See “– Rig Management and Marketing Services” and “– Our Fleet – Fleet Status.”
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “Diamond Offshore,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.
Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
 On April 26, 2020 (or the Petition Date), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (or the Company) and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (which we refer to, together with the Company, as the Debtors) commenced voluntary cases (or the Chapter 11 Cases) for relief under chapter 11 (or Chapter 11) of title 11 of the United States Code (or the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (or the Bankruptcy Court). The Chapter 11 Cases were jointly administered under the caption In re Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., et al., Case No. 20-32307 (DRJ).
 On January 22, 2021, the Debtors entered into a Plan Support Agreement (or the PSA) among the Debtors, certain holders of the Company’s then-existing 5.70% Senior Notes due 2039, 3.45% Senior Notes due 2023, 4.875% Senior Notes due 2043 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2025 (collectively, the Senior Notes) party thereto and certain holders of claims (collectively, the RCF Claims) under the Company’s then-existing $950.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility (or RCF). Concurrently, the Debtors entered into the Backstop Agreement (as defined in the PSA) with certain holders of Senior Notes and entered into the Commitment Letter (as defined in the PSA) with certain holders of RCF Claims to provide exit financing upon emergence from bankruptcy.
 The Debtors filed a joint Chapter 11 plan of reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court on January 22, 2021, which was subsequently amended on February 24, 2021 and February 26, 2021 (or the Plan). On March 23, 2021, the Debtors filed the plan supplement for the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court, which was subsequently amended on April 6, 2021 and April 22, 2021 (or the Plan Supplement).
 On April 8, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan (or the Confirmation Order). On April 23, 2021 (or the Effective Date), all conditions precedent to the Plan were satisfied, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms, and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization. Upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, we eliminated a net $2.2 billion of debt.
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 of this report and Note 2 “Chapter 11 Proceedings – Chapter 11 Cases” and Note 11 "Prepetition Revolving Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Exit Debt" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 Fresh Start Accounting
 Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we met the criteria for and were required to adopt fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (or FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (or ASC) Topic 852, Reorganizations (or ASC 852), which on the Effective Date resulted in a new entity, the Successor, for financial reporting purposes, with no beginning retained earnings or deficit as of the fresh start reporting date.
Fresh start accounting requires that new fair values be established for the Company’s assets, liabilities, and equity as of the date of emergence from bankruptcy on April 23, 2021. The Effective Date fair values of the Successor’s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values as reflected on the historical balance sheets of the Predecessor. In addition, as a result of the application of fresh start accounting and the effects of the implementation
of the Plan, the financial statements for the period after April 23, 2021 will not be comparable with the financial statements prior to and including April 23, 2021. References to “Successor” refer to the Company and its financial position and results of operations after the Effective Date (or the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period from April 24, 2021 to December 31, 2021). References to “Predecessor” refer to the Company and its financial position and results of operations on or before the Effective Date (or from January 1, 2021 to April 23, 2021) and the year ended December 31, 2020.
 See Note 3 “Fresh Start Accounting” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 Our Fleet
 Our fleet enables us to offer services in the floater market on a worldwide basis. A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling rig that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs.
Semisubmersible rigs are comprised of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining afloat, off bottom. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling either by use of a set of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (or DP) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed to moor the rig. Although DP semisubmersibles are generally self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.
 A drillship is an adaptation of a ship-shaped maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a derrick with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drill site through the use of a DP system.

(a)Rated water depth for drillships and semisubmersibles reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed for drilling operations. However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (including, but not limited to, weather and sea conditions). 
 (b)Represents year rig was built and originally placed in service or year rig was redelivered with significant enhancements that enabled the rig to be classified within a different floater category than originally constructed.
 (c)GOM means U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
 (d)For ease of presentation in this table, customer names have been shortened or abbreviated. Warm Stacked is used to describe a rig that is idled (not contracted) and maintained in a “ready” state with a crew sized to enable the rig to be quickly placed into service when contracted. Cold Stacked is used to describe an idled rig for which steps have been taken to preserve the rig and reduce certain costs, such as crew costs and maintenance expenses. Depending on the amount of time that a rig is cold stacked, significant expenditures may be required to return the rig to a “ready” state. Contract Prep is used to describe activities undertaken by a rig that is being made ready for a future contract and may include customer-requested modifications to the rig. Shipyard is used to describe a rig that is contracted but currently in a shipyard for regulatory inspections or repair and maintenance activities. Under Contract is used to indicate that a rig has been contracted; however, the customer has not been named.
 (e)In February 2023, Apache verbally informed us that it intends to exercise its option to terminate its drilling contract for the Ocean Patriot. In accordance with the terms of the drilling contract, the Ocean Patriot will continue to perform services under the contract until at least July 2023. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
 (f)Rigs owned by and managed on behalf of Aquadrill LLC. See “—Rig Management and Marketing Services.”
 Markets
 The principal markets for our offshore contract drilling services are:
 •the Gulf of Mexico, including the United States, or U.S., and Mexico; 
 •Canada;
 •South America, principally offshore Brazil;
 •Australia and Southeast Asia; 
 •Europe, principally offshore the United Kingdom, or U.K.;
 •East and West Africa; and
 •the Mediterranean.
 We actively market our rigs worldwide. From time to time, our fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world. See Note 18 “Segments and Geographic Area Analysis” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
Offshore Contract Drilling Services
 Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. We typically obtain our contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for us to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Our drilling contracts generally provide for a basic dayrate regardless of whether or not drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts generally also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, we generally pay the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of
our revenues. In addition, from time to time, our dayrate contracts may also provide us the ability to earn an incentive bonus from our customer based upon performance.
 The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which we refer to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, which we refer to as a term contract. Our drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost, or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of our contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally subject to mutually agreeable terms and rates at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog. Conversely, in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates, while customers with reasonably definite drilling programs may prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our rigs” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations — Our business involves numerous operating hazards that could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us,” in Item 1A of this report. For a discussion of our contract backlog, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contract Drilling Backlog” in Item 7 of this report.
Rig Management and Marketing Services
 In May 2021, we entered into an arrangement with Aquadrill LLC (or Aquadrill), an offshore drilling company, whereby we would provide management and marketing services for three rigs (or the MMSA). Per the MMSA, we earn a fixed daily fee for each rig, based on the status of the rig as either cold stacked, warm stacked, reactivation or operating. In addition, while a rig is under the MMSA, we are entitled to reimbursement of direct costs incurred in accordance with the MMSA. When a rig is operating under contract, the MMSA also provides for the payment of a variable fee based on the gross margin attained by the rig, including a bonus/malice component dependent on the financial performance of the rig, plus a commission as a percentage of revenue related to marketing services.
We currently manage two drillships, the West Auriga and the West Vela, both of which were contracted as of December 31, 2022. The MMSA for a third rig, the West Capricorn, was terminated in the third quarter of 2022 due to the sale of the rig by its owner.
Additionally, we have entered into and are currently operating under charter hire agreements with Aquadrill (or the Charters) for the West Auriga and West Vela for their contracts in the GOM. While the rigs are chartered, the MMSA is suspended and will resume upon termination of the Charters. The terms of the Charters are consistent with the MMSA, resulting in the same financial impact to us had the rigs remained under the MMSA. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contract Drilling Backlog” in Item 7 of this report and Note 4 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Revenues Related to Managed Rigs” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
 Customers
We provide offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During the Successor periods for the year ended December 31, 2022 and from April 24, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and the Predecessor periods from January 1, 2021 through
April 23, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, we performed services for seven, eight, ten and twelve different customers, respectively. Our most significant customers during these periods were as follows:

 (1)Excludes revenues, primarily reimbursable revenue, attributable to the MMSA with Aquadrill of $58.0 million and $45.3 million earned during 2022 and the period from April 24, 2021 through December 31, 2021, respectively. See “— Rig Management and Marketing Services.”
 No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our annual total consolidated revenues during the Successor periods for the year ended December 31, 2022 and from April 24, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and the Predecessor periods from January 1, 2021 through April 23, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations — Our customer base is concentrated” in Item 1A of this report.
Backlog
 As of January 1, 2023, our contract backlog was an aggregate $1.8 billion attributable to ten customers, compared to $1.2 billion as of January 1, 2022 also attributable to ten customers. For the five-year period from 2023 to 2027, $1.4 billion (or 81%) of our contracted backlog as of January 1, 2023 was attributable to future operations with three customers, including one customer contracted for five rigs and another customer contracted for three rigs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contract Drilling Backlog” in Item 7 of this report. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized” in Item 1A of this report.
Competition
 Based on industry data, as of the date of this report, there are approximately 685 mobile drilling rigs (drillships, semisubmersibles and jack-up rigs) in service worldwide, including approximately 190 floater rigs. Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than we do.
Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
We compete in a single, global offshore drilling market, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. See “– Markets.” Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a worldwide basis, as these rigs are mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. The current market remains very competitive. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition” in Item 1A of this report.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory and Legal Risks – We are subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit our business activities and revenues and increase our costs,” “Risk Factors – Environmental, Social and Governance Risks – Any future regulations relating to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business” and “Risk Factors – Regulatory and Legal Risks – If we, or our customers, are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to delay, suspend or cease our operations” in Item 1A of this report.
Human Capital
 Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we managed a global workforce of approximately 2,100 persons including international crew personnel, a portion of whom are furnished through independent labor contractors. A portion of our workforce outside of the U.S. is represented by collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2022, over 57% of our global workforce had been employed by us for five years or more, with an average tenure of approximately 10 years.
Core Values and Culture
 Our global culture is shaped by our Values & Behaviors:
 •Take Ownership – Run to the challenge; deliver on what you promise.
 •Go Beyond – Solve tomorrow’s problems today; make it better than you found it.
 •Have Courage – Challenge conventional thinking; speak up, even when it’s tough.
 •Exercise Care – Respect that every action has consequences; never cut corners.
 •Win Together – Learn from each other; share success; champion a “Culture of We.”
 
These core values establish the foundation for our culture and represent the key expectations we have of our employees. Our commitment to Health, Safety and the Environment (or HSE) applies throughout our business. In addition, we recognize the importance of identifying, assessing and promoting Environmental, Social and Governance (or ESG) issues as a fundamental part of conducting business.
Along with our core values, we expect our employees to act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which we refer to as our Code of Conduct. Our Code of Conduct covers various topics including legal compliance, conflicts of interest, accuracy of financial reporting and disclosure, confidentiality, discrimination and harassment, anti-corruption, safety and health and reporting ethical violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline).
Talent Management and Training
  We take a systemic approach to hiring, training and developing our employees. This includes creating goals aligned to company priorities and providing employees periodic feedback in order to assess and adjust individual performance. We also employ a succession planning process that identifies suitable candidates, and their development needs, for key positions in our company. We generally review the succession plan annually.
 We provide a comprehensive training program that endeavors to ensure that employees on our rig crews receive position-specific training as an integral part of their career development. We utilize a competency verification program
for establishing and verifying the knowledge, skills and abilities needed by each employee to perform their assigned job function in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
 Safety
The safety of our employees and stakeholders is our highest priority. We pride ourselves on being an innovative leader in the development and implementation of sophisticated and efficient job safety programs. We not only try to work safely; we also strive to achieve zero incident operations, or ZIO, through our comprehensive safety initiatives. Achieving ZIO means operating at peak performance and completing each task without harm to our people, the environment or our equipment.
