ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General

We were incorporated on July 17, 2006, under the laws of British Columbia, Canada under the name Golden Predator Mines Inc. We were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Metals Corp. for the purpose of holding precious metals and certain specialty metals assets.  In order to focus on specialty metals, during February 2009 we transferred most of our precious mineral assets to our then wholly owned subsidiary Golden Predator Corp., and on March 6, 2009, we completed a spin-out of Golden Predator Corp. to our shareholders. Effective March 12, 2009, we changed our name to EMC Metals Corp. In order to reflect a new emphasis on mining for scandium minerals, effective November 19, 2014, we changed our name to Scandium International Mining Corp (“SCY” or the “Company”).

We are a reporting issuer in the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and our common shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “SCY.” 

Our head office is located at 1390 Ione Pass Trail, Reno, Nevada 89523. The address of our registered office is 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T8.     

Our most advanced project is the Nyngan Scandium Project, located in New South Wales, Australia (the “Nyngan Scandium Project”), on which we hold a mine lease grant and a development consent. We also hold an exploration license on a scandium mineral property located near Nyngan known as the “Honeybugle Scandium property” and a reservation on an exploration license on a scandium mineral property in Finland, known as the “Kiviniemi Scandium property.” 

During the first quarter of 2022, SCY completed an internal review of its portfolio of assets and projects. The purpose of this review was to determine the appropriate allocation of capital between the Company’s scandium activities and the recently announced initiatives on Critical Metals Recovery (CMR) and High Purity Alumina (HPA). The board decided and announced on April 18, 2022, that the best return on invested capital for its shareholders was to prioritize the Company’s portfolio of scandium assets including the Nyngan Scandium Project and to idle its CMR and HPA initiatives. As a result of the review, leadership changes were also made with the appointment of an interim CEO and CFO and a downsizing of the board to four directors.

As its first priority, the new management completed a C$3.4 million non-brokered equity private placement which replenished cash balances and eliminated negative working capital. The second priority was to reduce costs and the Company has been successful in reducing corporate G&A costs including being able to reverse over $1 million in accruals during 2022. 

Our plan of operation for 2023 is to continue to reduce costs and position the Company to benefit from the growing market adoption of Scandium. This includes moving forward with our patent portfolio and filing a new mine lease application to re-establish the original Mining License, giving access to the full scandium resource at Nyngan and conduct drilling campaigns at both Nyngan and Honeybugle to further delineate the resources.

Business Operations

Company, Projects and Markets Summary

We are a mineral exploration and development company that is at an exploration stage. Our most advanced project is the Nyngan Scandium Project, located in New South Wales, Australia (the “Nyngan Scandium Project”), on which we hold a mine lease grant, a development consent, and 100% of the mineral rights. The Company has completed a definitive feasibility study on the Nyngan Scandium Project dated May 4, 2016 (the “Feasibility Study” or “DFS”), which was prepared independently in accordance with NI 43-101. The results of the DFS include a 16.9 million tonne measured and indicated resource (grading 235ppm at a 100ppm cut-off) and a 1.43 million tonne mineral reserve (combined proven and probable), based on economics established in that study. The DFS was filed on May 6, 2016, and is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com), on the Company’s website (www.scandiummining.com) and on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). A summary of the DFS is provided herein under “Item 2. Properties, Projects and Patents – Description of Mineral Projects – Nyngan Scandium Project – Nyngan Feasibility Study.”

The Company also holds exploration licenses on two separate scandium-prospective properties:


· | an exploration license on the Honeybugle Scandium property, located 24 kilometers from the Nyngan Scandium Project, granted in 2014; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | an exploration license on the Kiviniemi Scandium Property a scandium-prospective property in central Finland, granted in 2018. 

Corporate Objectives and Strategy

Our corporate focus is the development of projects that enable the production and sale of scandium and scandium-based products. That scandium focus has now been expanded to include other specialty metals, identified by the US Department of Commerce on a list of 35 critical metals, which specifically includes scandium. In this regard, the Company remains open to pursuing various host project opportunities that can produce a basket of metal products, including scandium, along with other technology-driven critical metals.

The Nyngan Scandium Project remains the most advanced project in the Company portfolio at this time, with permitting largely complete and a published DFS on SEDAR. Subject to successful construction financing and customer sales agreements, we intend to develop the Nyngan Scandium Project for production and supply of scandium oxide and scandium-content products. The Company has been successful in developing capability to manufacture an aluminum-scandium master alloy product, specifically for sale to aluminum alloy customers. This additional product capability enhances the Company’s ability to sell scandium-containing products to the aluminum industry, and potentially generate additional margins in certain markets. For further information on the Nyngan Scandium Project, please refer to “Item 2. Properties - Description of Mineral Projects – Nyngan Scandium Project” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Product Markets for Scandium 

Scandium is the 31st most abundant element in the earth’s crust (average 33 ppm), which makes it more common than lead, mercury, and precious metals, but less common than copper. Scandium has characteristics that are similar to rare earth elements, and it is often classified as a member of that group, although it is technically a light transition metal. Scandium occurs in nature as an oxide, rarely occurs in concentrated quantities because it does not selectively combine with the common ore-forming anions and is very difficult to reduce to a pure metal state. Scandium is typically produced and sold as a powder, in oxide form, and known as scandium oxide, scandia or Sc2O3., 

Global annual production estimates of scandium range from 15 tonnes to 20 tonnes, but accurate statistics are not available due to the lack of public information from countries in which scandium is currently being produced, specifically China and Russia. Two sources of scandium production outside of China and Russia have recently commenced production. The Taganito Nickel Mine in the Philippines (Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.) reported sales of 16 tonnes of Scandium Oxalate in 2021. 

In October 2022, Rio Tinto announced that Rio Tinto Fer et Titane in Quebec plans to quadruple scandium oxide production capacity to 12 tonnes from its current 3 tonne per annum capacity. This C$30-35 million expansion is expected to produce incremental scandium oxide in 2024. 

There is no reliable pricing data on global scandium oxide trading. Scandium oxide is typically traded in small quantities, between private parties, and pricing is not transparent to other buyers or sellers as there is no clearing facility as is more common with commercially traded metals and commodities. The U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) in its latest available report (dated January 2022) documents the 2021 price of scandium oxide (99.99% grade) at US$2,200/kg, indicating a significant reduction from the 2020 price estimate of US$3,800/kg. They also estimate the global sales of scandium oxide to be between 15-25 tpy, principally from China, Russia and the Philippines.

Prices vary, based on purity and quantity supplied. The USGS pricing generally reflects small volume sales, with larger quantities selling at lower prices, typically under US$2,000/kg. USGS reporting also acknowledged that ex-works China prices for 99.99% purity oxide were considerably lower than US-observed prices in 2021, based on underutilization of existing Chinese production capacity. Scandium oxide grades of 95-99% are generally considered suitable for manufacturing AlSc 2% master alloy, the form demanded for aluminum alloy applications  

Scandium can also be effectively purchased in the form of aluminum-scandium (Al-Sc) master alloy, typically containing 2% scandium by weight. This product is the preferred form for manufacture of aluminum alloys containing scandium. The current January 2022 USGS report indicates the 2021 price for Al-Sc 2% master alloy at US$350/kg, slightly higher than the 2020 USGS average. Recent USGS estimated prices for Al-Sc 2% master alloy have also been high relative to commonly available prices ex-works China, which have trended under US$100/kg and are available in one tonne lots or greater today. 

Principal uses for scandium are in high-strength aluminum alloys, high-intensity metal halide lamps, electronics, and laser research. Recently developed applications include welding wire and fuel cells which are expected to be in future demand. Approximately 15 different commercial aluminum-scandium alloys have been developed, and some of them are used for aerospace applications. In Europe and the U.S., scandium-containing alloys have been evaluated for use in structural parts in commercial airplanes and high stress parts in automobile engines and brake systems. Military and aerospace applications are known to be of interest, although with less specificity. The combination of high strength, weldability and ductility makes aluminum-scandium alloys potentially attractive replacements for existing aluminum alloys in a number of applications where improved alloy properties can add value to final products.

Competitive Conditions

We compete with numerous other companies and individuals in the search for and the acquisition or control of attractive rare earth and specialty metals mineral properties and opportunities. Our ability to profitably build a portfolio of commercial operations in this market segment will depend on our acquisition success in finding and securing attractive positions for development, our ability to operate the plants and facilities we commit to construct, and our success in marketing the products we manufacture against competing producers in the marketplace. 

In regard to our plan to produce scandium, there are a limited number of scandium producers presently. If we are successful at becoming a producer of scandium, our ability to be competitive will require that we establish a reliable supply of scandium to the market, delivered at purity levels demanded by various applications, and that our operating costs generate satisfactory margins, recognizing true prices will be set by customers and competitors in a market that is yet to mature.  

Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws

The development of any of our mining properties will require numerous local and national government approvals and environmental permits. For further information about governmental approvals and permitting requirements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and Nyngan Scandium Project -
