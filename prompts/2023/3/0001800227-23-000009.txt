OVERVIEW
Who We Are 
IAC is today comprised of category leading businesses, including Angi Inc., Dotdash Meredith and Care.com, as well as others ranging from early stage to established businesses.
As used herein, “IAC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and other similar terms refer to IAC Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
Our History 
IAC began as a hybrid media/electronic retailing company over twenty-five years ago. Since then, IAC (directly and through predecessor entities) has transformed itself into a leading Internet company through the development, building, acquisition and distribution to its stockholders of a number of businesses and continues to build companies and invest opportunistically.
From and after the late 1990s, we acquired a number of e-commerce companies, including Ticketmaster Group (later renamed Ticketmaster), Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com), Expedia.com, Match.com, LendingTree (later renamed Tree.com, Inc.), TripAdvisor, HomeAdvisor and Ask Jeeves, as well as Interval International (later renamed Interval Leisure Group, Inc.).
In 2005, we completed the separation of our travel and travel-related businesses and investments into an independent public company, Expedia, Inc. (now known as Expedia Group, Inc.). In 2008, we separated into five independent public companies: IAC (then IAC/InterActiveCorp), HSN, Inc. (now part of Qurate Retail, Inc.), Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (now part of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation), Ticketmaster (now known as Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc. (now known as LendingTree, Inc.). Following this transaction, we continued to invest in and acquire e-commerce companies, including About.com (later renamed Dotdash) and a number of online dating companies in the United States and various jurisdictions abroad.
In 2017, we completed the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor financial reporting segment with those of Angie’s List, Inc. under a new public company, ANGI Homeservices Inc. (now known as Angi Inc.), that we control. And in 2018, through this entity we acquired Handy Technologies, Inc., a leading platform in the United States for connecting consumers looking for household services with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals.
In February 2020, we acquired Care.com, a leading online destination for families to connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes, and for caregivers to connect with families seeking care services. In June 2020, we completed the separation of our online dating businesses into an independent public company, Match Group, Inc. 
In May 2021, we completed the spin-off of our full stake in our Vimeo business, after which Vimeo, Inc. (formerly Vimeo Holdings, Inc. (“Vimeo”)) became an independent public company. In December 2021, through Dotdash Media Inc., we completed the acquisition of Meredith Holdings Corp., owner of a portfolio of publishing brands, such as PEOPLE, Better Homes & Gardens, FOOD & WINE, Allrecipes, Southern Living and InStyle. Following the acquisition, we refer to the combined entity, which operates the brands and businesses of our former Dotdash financial reporting segment and those of Meredith Holdings Corp., as Dotdash Meredith. 
In April 2022, we announced a $60 million primary and secondary investment in Vivian Health, a platform to efficiently connect healthcare professionals with job opportunities, in which we hold a controlling interest. In November 2022, we completed the sale of Bluecrew, a technology driven staffing platform exclusively for flexible W-2 work. Lastly, we hold a meaningful stake (initial and follow-on stakes acquired in August 2020 and August 2022, respectively) in MGM Resorts International, a leader in gaming, hospitality and leisure.
EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE
IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and shares of Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis. As of the date of this report, Barry Diller, IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive, his spouse (Diane von Furstenberg) and his stepson (Alexander von Furstenberg), collectively hold (directly and through certain trusts) 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Together with shares of IAC common stock held as of the date of this report by Mr. Diller (172,708), Mr. von Furstenberg (75,510), a trust for the benefit of certain members of Mr. Diller’s family (136,711) and a family foundation (1,711), these holdings collectively represent approximately 41.3 % of the total outstanding voting power of IAC (based on the number of shares of IAC common and Class B common stock outstanding on February 10, 2023). As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller also holds 1,000,000 vested options to purchase shares of IAC common stock. 
Pursuant to that certain voting agreement, dated as of November 5, 2020, by and among Mr. Diller and the trustees of certain trusts through which all 5,789,499 shares of Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of common stock are held (the “Diller Parties”), on the one hand, and Joseph M. Levin, IAC’s Chief Executive Officer, on the other hand, (the “Voting Agreement”):
•the Diller Parties agreed to vote all shares of IAC common stock and IAC Class B common stock held by them in favor of Mr. Levin’s election to the IAC board of directors at each meeting of IAC stockholders at which Mr. Levin stands for election;
•prior to a vote being taken on specified Contingent Matters (a material acquisition or disposition of any assets or business by IAC or its subsidiaries, the entry by IAC into a material new line of business and the spin-off or split-off to IAC stockholders of (or similar transaction involving) a material business of IAC submitted for IAC stockholder approval), Mr. Diller (or following Mr. Diller’s death or disability or Mr. Diller ceasing to serve as a director or executive officer of IAC, Alexander von Furstenberg or his successor), in consultation with the other Diller Parties, and Mr. Levin, will seek agreement on how to vote the shares of IAC common stock and IAC Class B common stock held by the Diller Parties; provided, however, that if an agreement is not reached to support any such proposal, the Diller Parties have agreed to vote all shares of IAC common stock and IAC Class B common stock held by them against any such proposal; and
•if any of the Diller Parties determines to sell shares of IAC Class B common stock to a person other than Mr. Diller, his family members or certain entities controlled by such persons, they will discuss with Mr. Levin selling such shares to him before selling to any other party.
The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate upon a “Change in Control” of IAC (as defined in the Restricted Stock Agreement between Mr. Levin and the Company dated November 5, 2020) or the termination of Mr. Levin’s employment with IAC.
 In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or IAC common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to certain limited matters specified in the governance agreement in the event that IAC’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period. 
As a result of the IAC securities held by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family (as described above), Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence (subject to IAC’s organizational documents and Delaware law) the composition of IAC's board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval (such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions). In addition, as a result of the Voting Agreement, Mr. Levin is currently in a position, subject to IAC’s organizational documents and Delaware law, to influence his election to IAC's board of directors and the outcome of Contingent Matters (as defined in the Voting Agreement).

Digital
The Digital business delivers digital content through a portfolio of brands that have leadership in those subject areas that Dotdash Meredith believes matter most to consumer audiences (including entertainment, food, home, beauty, travel, health, family, luxury and fashion). The Digital business provides original and engaging digital content in a variety of formats, including articles, illustrations, videos and images, working with hundreds of experts in their respective fields (including doctors, chefs and certified financial advisors, among others) to create and produce thousands of pieces of original content that we publish across our portfolio of brands on a monthly basis. 
Print
Through the Print business, we are a leading magazine publisher in the United States. The Print business published 19 magazines as of December 31, 2022, as well as more than 400 special interest publications during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Print editorial teams create premium content covering subjects that Dotdash Meredith believes matter most to consumer audiences in a format that it believes consumers enjoy for its convenience and thoughtful editorial curation. The majority of the publishing brands and content within the Print business (for example, PEOPLE, Better Homes & Gardens and Southern Living) is focused on interests related to women and lifestyle. In addition, special interest publications provide in-depth information, education and entertainment on single topics and trends that Dotdash Meredith believes are timely and relevant to consumer audiences (including food, home, entertainment, and health and wellness). Most special interest publications have a high ratio of editorial to advertising content and are premium priced (for consumers) relative to subscription titles (see below).
The Print business distributes print magazines on a subscription basis (both direct and via agency partners) and through newsstands, with the majority of distribution occurring on a subscription basis. The Print business had approximately 20 million active subscriptions as of December 31, 2022. The majority of Dotdash Meredith subscription publications are issued between four and twelve times annually, with PEOPLE issued weekly. Single copies of subscription and special interest publications are sold through newsstands. 
 Revenue
Dotdash Meredith revenue consists of digital and print revenue. Digital revenue consists principally of advertising, performance marketing and licensing and other revenue. Print revenue consists principally of subscription, advertising, project and other, newsstand and performance marketing revenue.
Digital. Advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly by Dotdash Meredith's sales team and through programmatic advertising networks. Performance marketing revenue includes commissions generated through affiliate commerce, affinity marketing and performance marketing channels. Affiliate commerce and performance marketing commission revenue is generated when Dotdash Meredith brands refer consumers to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction. Affinity marketing programs partner with third parties to market and place magazine subscriptions online for both Dotdash Meredith and third-party publisher titles where Dotdash Meredith acts as an agent. Licensing revenue includes symbolic licenses, which include direct-to-retail product partnerships based on Dotdash Meredith's brands, and functional licenses, which consist of content licensing agreements. 
Print. Subscription revenue relates to the sale of Dotdash Meredith print magazine subscriptions. Print advertising revenue relates to the sale of advertising in magazines directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies. Project and other revenue relates to other revenue streams that are primarily project based and may relate to any one or combination of the following activities: audience targeting advertising, custom publishing, content strategy and development, email marketing, social media, database marketing and search engine optimization. Newsstand revenue is related to single copy print magazines or bundles of single copy magazines sold to wholesalers for resale on newsstands. Performance marketing principally consists of affinity marketing revenue, in connection with which Dotdash Meredith partners with traditional customer facing channels (such as brick and mortar retailers and call centers) to place print magazine subscriptions for third-party publishers.
Marketing
The Digital business markets its digital content through a full suite of digital distribution channels, as well as via direct navigation to its various branded websites. The Print business markets its content through a variety of channels, including direct mail, search engines, social media, email, websites, affiliate links and third-party partnerships. Dotdash Meredith prefers a subscription-focused distribution approach for print publications because of its belief that this approach fosters long-term, direct relationships with consumers and creates greater monetization opportunities.
Competition
The Digital business is characterized by ever evolving technology, frequent product evolution and changing preferences of consumers, advertisers and marketers. Digital media is intensely competitive, particularly for consumer attention (both attracting and retaining), driving traffic to various Dotdash Meredith Digital brands through search engines (and the display of information from such brands (and links to websites offering Dotdash Meredith content) within search engine results) and spending from advertisers and marketers. In the case of the Digital business, competitors primarily include diversified multi-platform media companies, other online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories, news aggregators, search engines and social media platforms. Some of these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger user bases and/or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than Dotdash Meredith does. As a result, these competitors may have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their digital content, which could result in greater market acceptance of their digital content relative to Dotdash Meredith digital content. 
Print publishing is a highly competitive business. Dotdash Meredith Print magazines and related publishing products and services compete primarily with other print magazine publishers, as well as other mass media (online and offline) and many other leisure-time activities. While competition is strong for established print magazine brands, gaining readership for new print magazines and special interest publications is especially competitive.
We believe that the ability of the Digital and Print businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•the ability to maintain and grow their large reach to American consumers across existing, as well as new and emerging platforms;
•the quality of the content and editorial features in digital content, print magazines and special interest publications;
•the ability to continue to maintain and build recognized expertise and authority in the vertical subject areas that Dotdash Meredith believes matter most to consumer audiences, and to continue to create content and experiences that are useful, relevant and entertaining to consumer audiences and reflect their evolving preferences;
•the ability to continue to attract (and increase) traffic to Digital publishing brands through search engines, including the ability to ensure that information from such brands and related links are displayed prominently in search engine results, as well as the ability to respond to changes in the usage and functioning of search engines;
•the ability to continue to build and maintain brand recognition, trust and loyalty across the Dotdash Meredith portfolio of publishing brands; 
•the performance and visibility of the Dotdash Meredith portfolio of publishing brands (primarily across digital platforms) relative to those of its competitors; 
•the ability to continue to grow and diversify monetization solutions, including advertising, e-commerce and affiliate relationships, performance marketing and other solutions;
•the ability to leverage existing proprietary platforms and data to provide consumer audiences with performant and relevant sites and experiences that are respectful (with targeted, limited ads) and privacy and search engine policy compliant; 
•the ability to maintain and grow relationships with advertisers, in the case of the Digital business, through performant ads, targeting audiences and unique branded offerings (all with efficient reach to influence branding through to purchase) and in the case of the Print business, which will depend on:
•the rates charged for print advertising;
•the circulation levels of print magazines and the profit derived from such circulation;
•the breadth of demographic reach in terms of subscriptions and readership; and
•the ability to consistently provide advertisers and marketers with a compelling return on their investments;
•the ability to grow e-commerce related content and experiences and leverage the Dotdash Meredith portfolio of publishing brands and expertise to result in purchases and transactions and to continue to maintain good relationships with third parties upon which we depend in connection these efforts; and
•in the case of the Print business only:
•the ability to retain existing subscribers and successfully drive new subscribers to print magazines in a cost-effective manner;
•the ability to maintain print advertising rate cards and the number of pages sold by brand and issue; 
•prices charged for print magazines; and
•the ability to provide quality customer service to advertisers, marketers and subscribers.
Angi Inc.
Overview
Angi Inc. (formerly ANGI Homeservices Inc.) is a publicly traded company that connects quality home service professionals with consumers across more than 500 different categories, from repairing and remodeling homes to cleaning and landscaping. During the year ended December 31, 2022, over 220,000 domestic service professionals actively sought consumer leads, completed jobs or advertised work through Angi Inc. platforms. Additionally, consumers turned to at least one Angi Inc. business to find a service professional for approximately 29 million projects during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, our Angi Inc. segment presentation was changed to reflect four operating segments, which now include: (i) Ads and Leads, (ii) Services, (iii) Roofing and (iv) International (includes Europe and Canada), with the various businesses within those segments operating under multiple brands. Angi Inc.'s financial information for prior periods has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. 

In the United States, the Ads business provides service professionals with the capability to engage with potential customers, as well as with quoting, invoicing and payment services. The Leads business provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find and communicate with local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. The Services business allows consumers to browse and buy common household services at set prices directly from Angi Inc., rather than requesting quotes from service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. When consumers request household services directly through the platforms within the Services business, requests are fulfilled by independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provide such services. The matching services and pre-priced offerings and related tools and directories are provided to consumers free of charge. The Roofing business provides roof replacement and repair services.
Ads and Leads
Overview. The Ads business connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals across more than 500 service categories, as well as provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews of local service professionals), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. Consumers can access the nationwide online directory and related basic tools and services free of charge upon registration, as well as by way of purchased membership packages. The Ads business also sells term-based website and mobile and magazine advertising to service professionals, as well as provides them with quoting, invoicing and payment services. The Leads business connects consumers with local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects through a digital marketplace, as well as provides consumers with tools and resources relating to their service professional search.
Consumer Services. Consumers can search for a service professional in the nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional through the Leads digital marketplace, as well as through certain third-party affiliate platforms. Consumers can also book appointments with service professionals through online on-demand services and connect with service professionals by phone, as well as access related basic tools and services, including an online True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for hundreds of project types nationwide, and a library of home services-related content consisting primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects, and general advice for working with service professionals. 
Matches are made by way of Angi Inc.’s proprietary algorithm, based on several factors (including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request). Depending on the nature of the service request and the path through which it was submitted, consumers are generally matched with service professionals from the Leads digital marketplace, a Services service professional or a combination of Ads and Leads service professionals from the nationwide directory and digital marketplace, respectively (as and if available for a given search request). In all cases, service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched directly and consumers can generally review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any Angi Inc. or third-party affiliate platforms. Consumers are responsible for booking the service and for paying the service professional directly, which can be done by consumers independently.
Consumers can rate service professionals listed in the nationwide online directory on a one- to five- star rating scale based on a variety of criteria, including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality, professionalism and other criteria, depending on the type of service provided. Ratings on each applicable criterion are weighted across all reviews submitted for the service professional to produce such professional’s overall rating. Consumers can also provide a detailed description of their experiences with service providers. Ratings and reviews cannot be submitted anonymously, and there are processes in place to prevent service professionals from reporting on themselves or their competitors, as well as to detect fraudulent or otherwise problematic reviews.
Service Professional Services. The Ads business sells term-based website and mobile and magazine advertising to certified service professionals, as well as provides them with a variety of services and tools, including quoting, invoicing and payment services. In order to become a certified service professional, service professionals must satisfy certain criteria, including earning the requisite member rating and validating their home services experience, and owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals must pass certain criminal background checks and attest to applicable licensure requirements. Generally, service professionals with an average consumer rating below a “3” are not eligible for certification. Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals become certified and can then purchase term-based advertising and/or be matched with consumers. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria, refuses to participate in Angi Inc.'s complaint resolution process and/or engages in what Angi Inc. determines to be prohibited behavior through any Angi Inc. 
platform, existing advertising and exclusive promotions will be suspended and the related advertising contact may be terminated.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in the nationwide online directory search results for an applicable category (together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information), with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, Angi Inc.’s proprietary algorithm will determine where a given service professional appears within related results.
Service professionals pay fees for consumer matches, at their election, and subscription fees for Leads memberships. The basic annual membership package includes membership in the digital marketplace, as well as access to consumer matches (for which additional fees are generally paid) and a listing in the Leads online directory and certain other affiliated directories, among other benefits. In addition to complying with commercial membership terms, once a member, service professionals must maintain the requisite customer rating (at least three stars). And if a service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the membership term, refuses to participate in Angi Inc.'s complaint resolution process or engages in what Angi Inc. determines to be prohibited behavior through any Angi Inc. platforms, the service professional may be removed from the digital marketplace.
Services
Overview. Through the Services business, Angi Inc. provides a pre-priced offering, pursuant to which consumers can request services through Angi and Handy branded platforms and pay for such services on the applicable platform directly. When consumers request household services directly through Services platforms, requests are fulfilled by independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provide such services.
Consumer Services. Consumers can submit requests for work to be done on Angi and Handy branded platforms and referrals will be made based on the type of service desired, location and the date and time the consumer wants the service to be provided. In addition, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third-party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by a Services service professional, which services are then paid for by the consumer directly through the applicable third-party retail partner platform. 
Service Professional Services. Services service professionals are provided with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals and must validate their home services experience, as well as attest to applicable licensure requirements and maintain an acceptable rating to remain on Services platforms. In addition, owners or principals of businesses affiliated with Services service professionals must pass certain criminal background checks. Access to Services platforms will be revoked for service professionals that repeatedly receive low customer satisfaction ratings. 
Roofing
The business within our Roofing segment provides roof replacement and repair services, primarily in Florida (and, to a lesser extent, in Arizona and Texas). Requests for roof replacement and repair services are currently fulfilled via Angi Roofing, LLC, the entity that was formed by Angi Inc. in July 2021 to acquire certain assets and liabilities of Total Home Roofing, LLC. Roofing consumers are identified through lead generation services, as well as through word-of-mouth and referrals. Angi Roofing, LLC contracts with independent roofing professionals in each market to fulfill service requests. 
 International (Europe and Canada)
  Through the International (Europe and Canada) segment, Angi Inc. also operates several international businesses that connect consumers with home service professionals, including: (i) Travaux, MyHammer and Werkspot, leading home services marketplaces in France, Germany and the Netherlands, respectively, (ii) MyBuilder, one of the leading home services marketplaces in the United Kingdom, (iii) the Austrian operations of MyHammer, (iv) the Italian operations of Werkspot and (v) Homestars, a leading home services marketplace in Canada. Angi Inc. owns controlling interests in Travaux, MyHammer, Werkspot and MyBuilder and wholly owns Homestars. The business models of the international businesses vary by jurisdiction and differ in certain respects from the business models of Angi Inc.’s various domestic businesses.
Revenue
 Ads and Leads revenue primarily reflects domestic ads and leads revenue, including consumer connection revenue for consumer matches, revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising and membership subscription revenue from service professionals and consumers. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the 
service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Services revenue primarily reflects revenue from pre-priced offerings, pursuant to which consumers request services through Services platforms and Angi Inc. then engages a service professional to perform the service. Roofing revenue primarily reflects revenue from Angi Inc.’s roof replacement offering, through which consumers purchase services directly from the Roofing business and Angi Inc. then engages a Roofing service professional to fulfill these requests. International revenue reflects revenue generated within the International segment (includes businesses in Europe and Canada), including consumer connection revenue for consumer matches and membership subscription revenue from service professionals and consumers.
Marketing
In March 2021, Angi Inc. (then known as ANGI Homeservices Inc.) updated one of its leading websites and brands, Angie’s List, to Angi, and concentrated its marketing investment in the Angi brand in order to focus its marketing, sales and branding efforts to a single brand. 
Angi Inc. markets its various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid and free search engine marketing, display advertising and third-party affiliate agreements), as well as through traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns) and e-mail. Pursuant to third-party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Angi Inc.’s various products and services (and those of its various service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through Angi Inc. platforms, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to Angi Inc. Angi Inc. also markets its various products and services to consumers through relationships with select third-party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail.
Angi Inc. markets term-based advertising and related products, as well as matching services and digital marketplace membership subscriptions, to service professionals primarily through its sales force. These products and services are also marketed, together with pre-priced offerings and various directories, through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers.
Both generally, and in connection with the brand integration initiative described above, Angi Inc. has made (and we expect that it will continue to make) substantial investments in digital and traditional offline marketing (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote its various products and services and drive visitors to Angi Inc. platforms and service professionals. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Ownership —The Angi Inc. brand integration initiative may continue to involve substantial costs, including as a result of a continued negative impact on organic search placement.”
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. Our Angi Inc. businesses compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. These businesses also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe Angi Inc.’s biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which are by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
 We believe that the ability of Angi Inc. to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the ability to continue to successfully build and maintain awareness of, and trust and loyalty to, the Angi brand;
•the functionality of Angi Inc. websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and Angi Inc. products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as the continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally; 
•the ability to expand pre-priced offerings, while balancing the overall mix of service requests and directory services on Angi Inc. platforms generally;
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of the network of service professionals and the breadth of online directory listings;
•the ability to consistently generate service requests and pre-priced bookings through Angi Inc. platforms that convert into revenue for service professionals in a cost-effective manner; 
•the ability to continue to attract (and increase) traffic to Angi Inc. brands and platforms through search engines, including the ability to ensure that information from such brands and platforms and related links are displayed prominently in free search engine results and that paid search marketing efforts are cost-effective, as well as the ability to respond to changes in the usage and functioning of search engines;
•the ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through Angi Inc. platforms, including various mobile applications (rather than through search engine marketing or via free search engine referrals); and
•the quality and consistency of service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.
Search
Overview
Our Search segment consists of Ask Media Group, a collection of websites providing general search services and information, and a Desktop business, which includes direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications and business-to-business partnership operations. Ask Media Group’s websites include, among others: Ask.com, a search site with a variety of fresh and contemporary content (celebrities, culture, entertainment, travel and general knowledge); Reference.com, a search and general knowledge content site that provides content across select vertical categories (history, business and finance and geography, among other verticals); Consumersearch.com, a search and content website that provides content designed to simplify the product research process; and Shopping.net, a vertical shopping search site, each of which contains a mix of search services and/or content targeted to various user or segment demographics. 
Products, Services and Content
Through Ask Media Group, we provide search services that generally involve the generation and display on a search results page of a set of hyperlinks to web pages deemed relevant to search queries entered by users. In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to an advertiser’s website. Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by the advertiser and relevancy to the search query. Through certain of Ask Media Group’s various websites, digital content in a variety of formats, primarily articles with images and/or illustrations, as well as slideshows or more in-depth presentations, is also provided in addition to general search services. Display advertisements and/or native advertising (advertising that matches the look, feel and function of the content alongside which it appears) generally appear alongside digital content.
The Desktop business primarily owns and/or operates a portfolio of legacy (meaning they are no longer actively marketed and distributed to new users) consumer desktop browser applications and websites that provide users with access to a wide variety of online content, tools and services, including new tab search services and the option of default browser search services.
Revenue
Ask Media Group revenue consists principally of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, as well as from display advertisements appearing alongside content on its various websites and, to a lesser extent, affiliate commerce commission revenue. The majority of the paid listings displayed by Ask Media Group is supplied to us by Google Inc. (“Google”) pursuant to our services agreement with Google. Pursuant to this agreement, Ask Media Group businesses transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price-per-click basis and when a user submits a search query through an Ask Media Group business and then clicks on a paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with the Ask Media Group business. Ask Media Group recognizes paid listing revenue when it delivers the user's click. In cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third-party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a payment obligation to the third-party distributor 
as traffic acquisition costs. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Ownership — Certain of our businesses depend upon arrangements with Google.”
Revenue from display advertising is generated through advertisements sold through programmatic advertising networks. Affiliate commerce commission revenue is generated when an Ask Media Group property refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction.
Revenue from our Desktop business largely consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. The majority of the paid listings displayed are supplied to us by Google in the manner, and pursuant to the services agreement with Google, described above. To a lesser extent, Desktop revenue also includes fees paid by subscribers for downloadable desktop applications, as well as display advertisements.
Marketing
Ask Media Group’s various properties are marketed primarily through the acquisition of traffic from major search engines and their syndication networks, which involves the purchase of keyword-based sponsored listings that link to search results pages of Ask Media Group properties, and other types of display media (primarily banner advertisements). 
Ask Media Group content is also marketed through a variety of digital distribution channels, including search engines, social media platforms, display advertising networks and native advertising networks, as well as a number of advertising agencies that acquire traffic via these channels for certain Ask Media Group properties. 
Search powered desktop applications were historically marketed to users primarily through business-to-business partnerships and to a lesser extent digital display advertisements and paid search engine marketing efforts.
Competition
In the case of general search services, Ask Media Group’s competitors include major search engines and other destination search websites and search-centric portals that engage in marketing efforts similar to those of Ask Media Group. In the case of content, Ask Media Group’s competitors primarily include online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories and social channels. We believe that Ask Media Group’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon:
•the continued ability to monetize search traffic via paid search listings, particularly in the case of mobile traffic; 
•the continued ability to market Ask Media Group search websites in a cost-effective manner, which depends, in part, on the ability to continue to obtain quality traffic from valid sources (from real users with genuine interest) in a cost- effective manner to Ask Media Group search websites;
•the relevance and authority of search results, answers and other content displayed on Ask Media Group various properties; 
•the continued ability to differentiate Ask Media Group search websites (which depends primarily upon its continued ability to deliver quality, authoritative and trustworthy content to users), as well as the ability to attract advertisers to these websites;
•the ability to successfully create or acquire content (or the rights thereto) for marketing purposes in a cost-effective manner; and 
•the ability to monetize content pages with display, native advertising and other forms of digital advertising.
Emerging & Other
 Overview
 Our Emerging & Other segment primarily includes:
•Care.com, a leading online destination for families to connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes, and for caregivers to connect with families seeking care services; 
•Mosaic Group, a leading developer and provider of global subscription mobile applications; 
•Vivian Health, a platform to efficiently connect healthcare professionals with job opportunities; 
•The Daily Beast, a website dedicated to news, commentary, culture and entertainment that publishes original reporting and opinion from its roster of full-time journalists and contributors; and
•IAC Films, a provider of production and producer services for feature films, primarily for initial sale and distribution through theatrical releases and video-on-demand services in the United States and internationally;
 Care.com
Overview. Through Care.com, we are a leading online destination for families to connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes, and for caregivers to connect with families seeking care services. Care.com features a portfolio of products and services spanning the entire care journey, including guidance for care options, a marketplace for searching for and connecting with in-home caregivers for a wide range of care options (such as nannies for children or companions for seniors), a directory of out-of-home care options, a Safety Center, care management features and access to care-related content and resources.
Services. Care.com primarily offers online consumer matching and consumer payment solutions for families searching for care and enterprise solutions (Care For Business) for employers seeking to provide care-related benefits to their employees.
• Consumer matching solutions. Through free and paid memberships to consumer matching services, Care.com offers a variety of resources designed to match and guide families toward the best care solutions. Free basic membership provides families with the ability to set up an account, post a job, search and review caregiver profiles and receive applications from background-checked caregivers. To engage with caregivers, families must generally upgrade to a paid premium membership, which includes all basic membership features, plus the ability to contact caregivers to schedule interviews, purchase additional background checks, reply to applications and messages from caregivers and access certain promotions and discounts. In addition, where available, families can book caregivers for certain care services directly through Care.com for a fee. 
Through consumer matching services, families can be matched with caregivers (in-home and out-of-home) who meet their diverse and evolving care needs (full-time, part-time, long-term, short-term and occasional at irregular intervals). Matching is facilitated by algorithms designed to highlight the most relevant caregiver(s) (based on user-generated content regarding the type and frequency of care requested, hourly rate for the job and responsibilities and other job requirements), as well as an internally monitored messaging system. In-home caregivers create and post detailed Care.com profiles that include photos, bios, work histories and reviews, the type of care they primarily provide, their experience, certifications and qualifications, and their availability, hourly rate and payment details, among other information. Before caregivers with Care.com profiles can communicate directly with families seeking care, they must complete a CareCheck background check (conducted by a third-party consumer reporting agency). Care.com also offers families and caregivers the ability to purchase multiple levels of additional background check options through a third-party consumer reporting agency. While Care.com strongly believes that CareCheck and the additional background checks are good safety measures, they have limitations and cannot guarantee the future behavior of any caregiver using Care.com. 
Care.com also maintains a Safety Center that provides resources and information designed to help families and caregivers make safer and more informed hiring and job selection decisions, including recommendations for screening, interviewing and ongoing monitoring of caregivers, as well as recommendations to caregivers for avoiding scams. Care.com also encourages members to contact Care.com if they believe another member or caregiver may have violated Care.com's community guidelines. 
Out-of-home care-related businesses (such as daycare centers, senior care facilities, tutoring companies, camps and activities) can also market their services through Care.com. 
• Consumer payment solutions. Through Care.com, we also offer consumer payments solutions that provide families with several options to manage financial relationships with caregivers, as well as help caregivers professionalize and manage their careers. These payment solutions include: 
• HomePay, a leading payroll and tax product for families who employ nannies, housekeepers or other domestic employees. HomePay is a technology-based, turnkey service that includes automated payroll processing, as well as household employer-related tax filings at the federal, state and local levels for families who are required to treat their caregivers as household employees and such caregivers' wages exceed the annual reportable threshold amount that would require them to make tax filings. Facilitating household employer-related tax filings helps to ensure that families are able to avail themselves of certain tax credits and savings, which can help mitigate care-related costs. Similarly, caregivers who are paid legally can access a variety of benefits, including unemployment insurance and social security benefits (among others). HomePay is available to anyone (not just members of our consumer matching solutions) for a fee; and 
• a peer-to-peer payments solution that enables families to make electronic payments to caregivers directly through Care.com's platform or mobile applications. Care.com believes that this solution is particularly relevant and helpful in the case of families who pay caregivers who provide care services at irregular intervals (such as babysitters, after-school caregivers or tutors, or in varying amounts each time services are performed).
• Enterprise solutions. Care.com also offers Care For Business, a comprehensive suite of care benefits and related services that employers can offer as an employee benefit. Currently, employers can choose from a number of services, including: 
• consumer matching solutions; 
• back-up care services (in-home and in-center) for employees who need alternative care arrangements for their child or senior when their regular caregiver is not available (for example, due to a school  closure or the caregiver illness); and 
• access to consultation and referral services to support a wide array of work-life challenges faced by employees, such as senior care planning services to help employees find the most suitable care option for aging family members, access to mental health experts and resources, tutoring and college prep  assistance, lactation support, relocation services and financial guidance and legal services (among other services).
Employers generally pay for enterprise solutions on a per employee per year basis and have access to features that allow them to manage employee access and track aggregate usage. Depending on the suite of services selected and employer preferences, employers may subsidize all, a portion or none of the cost of these solutions for employees. Additionally, employers may add services during the term of their contract on an as needed basis to enhance the support they provide to their employees. 
Revenue. Care.com generates revenue primarily through subscription fees from families and caregivers for its suite of products and services, as well as through annual contracts with employers who provide access to Care.com’s suite of products and services as an employee benefit and through contracts with businesses that recruit employees through its platform. 
Marketing. Care.com markets its various products and services to families and caregivers through a diverse mix of free and paid offline and online marketing, as well as its sales team. Care.com believes that most families and caregivers currently find Care.com through unpaid marketing channels (primarily through word-of-mouth, referrals and online communities and forums), as well as through search engine marketing (free and paid) and repeat users. Paid direct marketing efforts include offline channels, such as network and cable TV, OTT channels and direct mail, as well as through paid search engine marketing, display advertising, third-party affiliate agreements and select paid job board sites. In addition, Care.com markets its employee-benefit product offerings directly to enterprises through its sales team. 
Competition. In the case of consumer matching solutions, Care.com primarily competes with traditional offline consumer resources for finding caregivers, as well as online job boards and other online care marketplaces, as well as online care-related platforms in vertical categories. We believe Care.com’s biggest competition comes from the traditional offline methods through which most families find caregivers, which are through word-of-mouth, personal referrals and online communities and forums. In the case of HomePay, Care.com primarily competes with similar products offered by providers of online and offline payroll services. Care.com also competes for a share of the overall recruiting and advertising budgets of care-related businesses with traditional, offline media companies and other online marketing providers. In the case of Care For Business, Care.com primarily competes with other providers of employer-sponsored care services and employee benefit products, particularly those that provide back-up child and senior care services.
We believe that Care.com’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of the Care.com network of families and caregivers; 
•the functionality and reliability of Care.com websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features (and Care.com’s various products and services) generally to families and caregivers; 
•the ability to increase the frequency of family and caregiver use of Care.com products and services generally; 
•the continued ability to innovate and introduce new products and services that resonate with families and caregivers;
•the quality, completeness and consistency of caregiver profiles and job postings, as well the reliability of background check and other safety measures and the trustworthiness and reliability of caregivers; 
•the ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, the Care.com brand; 
•the ability to continue to expand the enterprise solutions business;
•the ability to continue to attract (and increase) traffic to Care.com through search engines, including the ability to ensure that links to Care.com platforms are displayed prominently in free search engine results and that paid search marketing efforts are cost-effective, as well as the ability to respond to changes in the usage and functioning of search engines; and
•the ability to continue to expand Care.com businesses in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
Mosaic Group
Overview. Through Mosaic Group, we are a leading developer and provider of global subscription mobile applications. As of December 31, 2022, Mosaic Group had approximately 3.5 million mobile paying subscribers.
Mosaic Group operated 45 branded mobile applications in over 28 languages across 192 countries as of December 31, 2022. These branded mobile applications consist of some of the largest and most popular applications in the following verticals: Communications (RoboKiller, TapeACall, Trapcall), Language (iTranslate, Speak & Translate), Weather (Clime: NOAA Weather Radar Live, Weather Live), Business (PDF Hero, Scan Hero) and Lifestyle (Blossom, Pixomatic). Robokiller thwarts both telemarketing and illegal spam phone calls, TapeACall provides prime-quality call recordings services and TrapCall unmasks the identity of blocked or unknown callers. Through iTranslate, subscribers can connect and communicate across numerous languages, and Speak & Translate provides voice and text translation services. Clime: NOAA Weather Radar Live provides up-to-date weather information and storm tracking worldwide and Weather Live provides customized weather forecasts based on user selected parameters. Through PDF Hero, users can annotate and store all of their PDF files in one place, and through Scan Hero, users can create, sign and edit PDFs by way of the camera on their mobile phones. Blossom provides plant identification and content on plant care and Pixomatic is a photo editing application. Mosaic Group’s various branded mobile applications are distributed to subscribers primarily through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 
We believe that Mosaic Group has the personnel, systems and expertise necessary to continue to build and scale leading mobile applications and grow mobile subscription businesses. By applying these resources and skills to both organically developed and acquired mobile applications, Mosaic Group has demonstrated success in scaling mobile applications across a wide variety of utility and productivity categories. 
Revenue. Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees paid by subscribers for downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and fees received directly from consumers, as well as display advertisements.
Marketing. Mosaic Group markets its mobile applications to users primarily through digital storefronts (primarily the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store) and digital display advertisements on social media, messaging and media platforms, as well as in-app and cross-app advertising.
Competition. The applications industry is competitive and there is no single, dominant mobile or desktop application brand globally. We believe that the ability of Mosaic Group to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the continued growth of consumer adoption of free and paid mobile applications generally and related engagement levels; 
•the ability to operate Mosaic Group mobile applications as a scalable platform; 
•the ability to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers (in the case of mobile traffic) in a cost-effective manner; 
•the ability to market and distribute Mosaic Group mobile applications through third party digital app stores (including the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store), in a cost-effective manner;
•the ability to continue to optimize marketing and monetization strategies, including through the diversification of marketing channels and improved acquisition and use of subscriber information;
•the continued growth of smartphone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets; 
•the continued strength of Mosaic Group brands; and 
•the continued ability to introduce new, enhanced and differentiated mobile applications in response to competitor offerings, consumer preferences, platform demands, social trends and evolving technological landscape.
Intellectual Property
We rely heavily upon our trademarks, service marks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets, and regard this intellectual property as critical to our success. We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from April 2023 to December 2038.
We have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew (or secure by contract where appropriate) trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections (as and if we deem appropriate) based on then current facts and circumstances and intend to continue to do so in the future. We rely on a combination of internal and external controls, including applicable laws, rules and regulations, and restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish, protect and otherwise control our various intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad involving matters that are important to (or may otherwise impact) our various businesses, such as broadband internet access, online commerce, privacy and data security, advertising, intermediary liability, consumer protection, taxation, worker classification and securities compliance. These domestic and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are continually evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations (and any amended, proposed or new laws and regulations) are often uncertain, particularly in the Internet industry, and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and over time, which could result in conflicts with our current policies and practices and those of our various businesses. 
Because we conduct substantially all of our business on the Internet, we are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that could adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact whether or how we may provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and/or undermine an open and neutrally administered Internet access. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. This order, which was released in January 2018 and took effect in June 2018, reversed net neutrality protections in the United States that had been in place since 2015, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by Internet service providers. In the wake of the FCC’s repeal of its net neutrality laws, many states (including California and New York) have adopted their own net neutrality laws imposing some degree of regulation on internet service providers operating in those states. Many of these regulations remain subject to legal challenge in the courts, although some (including the California law), have been allowed to take effect while those challenges are concluded. 
Also, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“Section 230”), which generally provides immunity for website publishers from liability for third party content appearing on their platforms and the good faith removal of third party content from their platforms that they may deem obscene or offensive (even if constitutionally protected speech), since its adoption has been (and continues to be) subject to a number of challenges. The immunities conferred by Section 230 could also be narrowed or eliminated through amendment, regulatory action or judicial interpretation. In recent years, various members of the U.S. Congress introduced bills to limit Section 230 and decisions in two cases currently before the U.S. Supreme Court could limit protections provided to website publishers by Section 230. Any future adverse changes to Section 230 could result in additional compliance costs for us and/or exposure to additional liabilities. In addition, the European Union’s Digital Services Act, which was enacted in November of 2022 (and becomes effective in 2024), enhances the moderation obligations and potential liabilities of digital platforms. Further, in 2023, the United Kingdom is expected to enact the Online Safety Bill, which will significantly increase responsibilities of online platforms to control illegal or harmful activity and grant broad authority to the communications regulator in the United Kingdom to enforce its provisions. 
.
Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users and subscribers, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data security, primarily in the case of our operations in the United States and the European Union and the handling of personal data of users located in the United States and the European Union. Recent examples of comprehensive regulatory initiatives in the area of privacy and data security include a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which applies to certain companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union, imposes significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance, as well as provides a private right of action for individual claimants. The GDPR will continue to be interpreted by European Union data protection regulators, which may require us to make changes to our business practices and could generate additional risks and liabilities. Data protection regulators in European Union member stated have taken a strict view of cookie consent requirements following the enactment of the GDPR and enforcement actions are on the rise.
In addition, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to the U.S., and on July 16, 2020, the ECJ invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as an adequate safeguard when transferring personal data from the EEA to the U.S. In addition, alternate legal bases for cross-border data transfers face continuing legal challenges. These regulations continue to evolve and may ultimately require us to devote resources towards compliance and/or make changes to our business practices to ensure compliance, all of which could be costly. Also, the exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. 
Moreover, while multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information are being considered by the U.S. Congress and various U.S. state legislatures, certain U.S. state legislatures have already enacted privacy legislation, one of the strictest and most comprehensive of which is the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020 (the “CCPA”). The CCPA provides data privacy rights for California consumers and restricts the ability of certain of our businesses to use personal California user and subscriber information in connection with their various products, services and operations. The CCPA also provides consumers with a private right of action for security breaches, as well as provides for statutory damages. In addition, on November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24 (the “California Privacy Rights Act of 2020”), which amends certain provisions of the CCPA and becomes fully enforceable on July 1, 2023. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 will further restrict the ability of certain of our businesses to use personal California user and subscriber information in connection with their various products and services and/or could impose additional operational requirements on such businesses. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have also passed comprehensive privacy legislation that will become effective in 2023 and 2024, all of which are similar to the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020. Lastly, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") continues to increase its focus on privacy and data security practice and we anticipate this focus to continue. If so, as a result, we could be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions in this area. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors — General Risk Factors — The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs.”
As a provider of certain subscription-based products and services, we are also impacted by laws or regulations affecting whether and how our businesses may periodically charge users for membership or subscription renewals. For example, the European Union Payment Services Directive, which became effective in 2018, could impact the ability of certain of our businesses to efficiently process auto-renewal payments for, as well as offer promotional or differentiated pricing to, users who reside in the European Union. Similar laws exist in the U.S., including the federal Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act and various U.S. state laws, and legislative and regulatory enactments or amendments are under consideration in a number of U.S. states. The adoption of any law that adversely affects revenue from recurring membership and/or subscription payments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of our Dotdash Meredith, Angi Inc., Care.com and Mosaic Group businesses.
We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations governing the marketing and advertising activities of our various businesses conducted by or through telephone, email, mobile digital devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM act and similar state laws, rules and regulations, as well as local laws, rules and regulations and relevant agency guidelines governing background screening.
In addition, we also are subject to various other federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations focused on consumer protection. These laws, rules and regulations are enforced by governmental entities such as the FTC and state Attorneys General offices and may confer private rights of action on consumers as well. Changes in these laws, or a proceeding of this nature, 
could have an adverse effect on us due to legal costs, impacts on business operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. 
We are also sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws. The European Commission and several European countries have adopted (or intend to adopt) proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which certain of our European businesses are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including digital services taxes in the United Kingdom, France and Italy, which are based on a percentage of revenue and tied to where consumers are located). Certain of our businesses are subject to digital services taxes in one or more of the jurisdictions listed above and similar proposed tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, primarily in the case of certain businesses within our Angi Inc. financial reporting segment, we are sensitive to the adoption of worker classification laws, specifically, laws that could effectively require us to change the classification of certain service professionals from independent contractors to employees. For example, California’s worker classification statute (AB 5) effectively narrowed the definition of an independent contractor, using a strict test to determine a given worker’s classification and placing the burden of proof for meeting that test on the hiring entity. AB 5 also provided enforcement powers to the state and certain cities, leading the state and certain cities to initiate litigation to enforce the new law, particularly against app-based platform companies. AB 5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion, leading other jurisdictions (including Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, among others) to bring enforcement actions against alleged independent contractor misclassification and/or to propose legislation adopting a legal test similar to the one set forth in AB 5. At the same time, there has been a trend of the Internal Revenue Service entering into work and information sharing arrangements with the U.S. Department of Labor and state taxing authorities to address worker classification issues. Since we currently treat certain service professionals as independent contractors for all purposes, we do not withhold federal, state and local income or other employment related taxes, make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments or provide workers’ compensation insurance with respect to such individuals. If we are required to reclassify service professionals as employees and/or their classification as independent contractors is challenged for any reason, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs for prior and future periods, including exposure under federal, state and local tax laws, workers’ compensation and unemployment benefits, minimum and overtime wage laws and other labor and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest. If the amounts related to such liabilities and additional costs are significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As of the date of this report, we are involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations challenging the classification of service professionals as independent contractors, none of which we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may become involved in other proceedings and investigations of this nature in the future. 
Lastly, as a company based in the U.S. with foreign offices in various jurisdictions worldwide, we are subject to a variety of foreign laws governing the foreign operations of its various businesses, as well as U.S. laws that restrict trade and certain practices, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
 Human Capital 
Overview 
IAC’s future success depends upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce across our various businesses worldwide. While policies and practices related to the identification, hiring, development, motivation and retention of employees vary across IAC and our various businesses, at their core, such policies and practices are generally designed to: (i) increase long-term IAC stockholder value by attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding employees with the competence, character, experience, diversity of perspective and ambition necessary to enable the Company to meet its growth objectives, (ii) encourage and support the professional development of, and engender loyalty among, employees who have demonstrated the strength, vision and determination necessary to overcome obstacles and unlock their true professional potential by providing them with appropriate opportunities within IAC and our businesses and (iii) help foster a diverse, inclusive and entrepreneurial culture across our various businesses.
In order to achieve these objectives, we believe that we must continue to provide competitive compensation packages and otherwise incentivize employees in unique and attractive ways, as well as develop and promote talent from within and remain committed to building inclusive workplaces and workforces that reflect the diversity of the global population using our products and services each day.
As of December 31, 2022, IAC had nearly 11,000 employees, substantially all of whom were full-time employees and the substantial majority of whom were based in the United States. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe that we must continue to provide competitive compensation packages and other benefits to our workforce. While compensation packages vary across IAC and our various businesses, compensation packages generally consist of base salary (plus commissions in the case of sales and other similar positions) and, on a discretionary basis, annual cash bonuses (and in certain cases, equity or equity-based awards).
We also provide comprehensive health, welfare and retirement benefits. Healthcare benefits are significantly subsidized by the Company and the coverage provided reflects our commitment to inclusivity and the physical and mental well-being of all employees.
In the case of welfare benefits, we maintain generous paid time off and paid leave policies across our businesses and offer subsidized backup child and elder care for our employees. We believe in giving back to the causes and charities that are important to our employees and match charitable contributions made by our employees to qualifying charities on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to an annual cap per employee. We also encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and work and provide our employees with paid time off each year to volunteer for charitable and community service projects.
In the case of retirement benefits, in the U.S., we offer our employees a 401(k) retirement savings program with generous employer matching contributions, subject to an annual cap per employee. We believe that we have a responsibility to encourage (and contribute to) the retirement readiness of each of our employees and believe that this generous 401(k) retirement savings program matching contribution is a meaningful commitment to the long-term welfare and security of our workforce.
Talent Development
We generally aim to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. As a result, senior management across the Company and our businesses generally possesses a great depth of knowledge and experience regarding the Company, with external hires providing a fresh perspective. The human resources teams across the Company and our businesses use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled, talented and diverse employees, and employee referrals for open positions are encouraged.
In addition, we actively seek to identify the next generation of leaders in technology early through the IAC Fellows program, a first-of-its-kind program connecting students from under-served and under-resourced backgrounds with academic and leadership opportunities. IAC Fellows join the program as early as high school and stay for up to six years, rotating across a diverse set of IAC businesses during that time in the form of competitively paid internships that put IAC Fellows in the trenches, testing their skills in real world scenarios. Through these experiences, IAC Fellows gain exposure to different business models, functions and roles within IAC, as well as access to IAC senior leadership as mentors and coaches. IAC Fellows also receive an academic stipend following the completion of each paid internship. For those IAC Fellows hired by IAC or any of its businesses following the completion of their paid internships and who stay for a period of three years, IAC will pay off the entirety of their school loans.
To be eligible for the IAC Fellows program, students must be from low-income backgrounds or families with financial need, with eligibility assessed individually based on the composition and income of a given student’s family, and with first-generation college students being given priority consideration. Students must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. and possess the following personal attributes: (i) leadership abilities, (ii) a strong interest in science, technology, computer science and/or math, (iii) demonstrated intellectual curiosity and devotion to study, (iv) a hunger to learn and achieve academically and (v) ethics, integrity and strength of character. 
Lastly, through our charitable foundation, we award scholarships to high-achieving students who have a demonstrable need for financial assistance as a result of household income that falls below the designated national poverty level or cultural and/or family background that has placed them at an educational disadvantage. Recipients can use scholarships for various college-related expenses, such as tuition, course-related fees, books, supplies and equipment.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building inclusive workplaces and workforces that reflect the diversity of the global population using our products and services each day. Accordingly, we view diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts as integral to our success. While DE&I efforts, policies and practices vary across our businesses, they include (in addition to the IAC Fellows program discussed above) at certain of our businesses: (i) pay equity analyses conducted on an annual basis to ensure that women and employees from traditionally under-represented groups are not adversely impacted by pay bias, (ii) employee community resource groups (ECGs) led and supported by senior executives (and in certain cases, funded by the relevant business) and (iii) launching DE&I councils at certain of our businesses that collaborate directly with senior executives to roll out DE&I training, as well to determine ways to diversify product and service experiences, attract a more diverse population of employees and invest in building diverse and equitable local communities.
