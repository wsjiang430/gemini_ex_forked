Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Xponential Fitness, Inc. (the “Company” or “XPO Inc.”) through its principal operating subsidiary, Xponential Fitness LLC (“XPO LLC”) is the largest global franchisor of boutique fitness brands. We operate a diversified platform of ten brands spanning across verticals including Pilates, indoor cycling, barre, stretching, rowing, dancing, boxing, running, functional training and yoga. XPO LLC franchisees offer energetic, accessible, and personalized workout experiences led by highly qualified instructors in studio locations across 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Canada, and through master franchise or international expansion agreements in nine additional countries. The Company's portfolio of brands includes Club Pilates, the largest Pilates brand in the United States; CycleBar, the largest indoor cycling brand in the United States; StretchLab, a concept offering one-on-one and group stretching services; Row House, the largest franchised indoor rowing brand in the United States; AKT, a dance-based cardio workout combining toning, interval and circuit training; YogaSix, the largest franchised yoga brand in the United States; Pure Barre, a total body workout that uses the ballet barre to perform small isometric movements, and the largest Barre brand in the United States; Stride, a treadmill-based cardio and strength training concept; Rumble, a boxing-inspired full-body workout; and BFT, a functional training and strength-based program.
 The foundation of our business is our strong partnerships with franchisees. We provide franchisees with extensive support to help maximize the performance of their studios and enhance their return on investment. In turn, we have found that this partnership accelerates our growth and increases our profitability. We believe our unique combination of a scaled multi-brand offering, resilient franchise model with strong unit economics and integrated platform has enabled us to build our leading market position in the large and growing U.S. boutique fitness industry.
 We carefully built the Xponential Fitness brand portfolio through a series of acquisitions, targeting select health and wellness verticals. In curating our portfolio, we identified brands with exceptional programming and a loyal consumer base which we believed would benefit from our operational expertise, franchising experience and scaled platform. With over 285 years of collective industry experience, our management team and brand presidents are the driving force behind our operational excellence. We have established a proven operational model (the “Xponential Playbook”) that helps franchisees generate compelling studio economics. The key pillars of our Xponential Playbook include:
 •optimizing the studio prototype and investment cost;
 •thoroughly vetting franchisee candidates;
 •real estate identification, site selection, studio build-out and design assistance;
 •comprehensive pre-opening support, including membership sales, marketing support, employee training and programming development;
 •detailed studio-level operational framework and best practices;
 •intensive instructor and studio-level management training;
 •our robust digital platform offerings that allow franchisees to generate incremental revenue;
 •data-driven analytical tools to support marketing strategies, member acquisition and retention;
 •sophisticated technology systems, including uniform point-of-sale and reporting systems, to drive studio-level performance;
 •centralized model capable of providing resources to franchisees in the event of exceptional crises; and
 •ongoing monitoring and support to promote success.


The Xponential Playbook is designed to help franchisees achieve compelling Average Unit Volumes (“AUVs”), strong operating margins and an attractive return on their invested capital. Studios are generally designed to be between 1,500 and 2,500 square feet in size, depending on the brand. The smaller box format contributed to a relatively low weighted average initial franchisee investment of approximately $350,000 in 2022 and 2021. By utilizing the Xponential Playbook, our model is generally designed to generate, a weighted average AUV of approximately $500,000 in year two of operations and studio-level operating margins ranging between 25% and 30%, resulting in an unlevered cash-on-cash return of approximately 40%.
 We believe our integrated platform, which supports our ten brands, is a unique competitive advantage in the boutique fitness industry and enables us to accelerate growth and enhance operating margins. Our multi-brand offering results in higher franchisee lead flow and conversion, which lowers franchisee acquisition costs. Existing franchisees also serve as an embedded pipeline for continued expansion across our brands. As a result of our scale, we benefit from greater access to real estate and favorable vendor relationships. Additionally, we leverage shared corporate services across franchise sales, real estate, supply chain, merchandising, information technology, finance, accounting and legal. As an integrated platform, we utilize technology to provide improved functionality, drive efficiency and access compelling data across our brands. Our robust digital platform, with content spanning all of our brands is an important example of our ability to utilize our integrated platform to enhance our individual brand offerings and member retention. We also benefit from knowledge sharing and best practices across the portfolio. We believe that we are in the early stages of unlocking the power of our platform and driving long-term growth.
 As a franchisor, we benefit from multiple predictable and recurring revenue streams that enable us to scale our franchised studio base in a capital efficient manner. As of December 31, 2022, franchisees were contractually committed to open an additional 1,939 studios in North America. Converting our current pipeline of licenses sold to open studios in North America would nearly double our existing franchised studio base. In addition, we had 312 studios operating internationally and master franchisees were contractually obligated to sell licenses to franchisees to open an additional 1,094 studios, of which master franchisees have sold 236 licenses for studios not yet opened as of December 31, 2022.
 Our Industry
 We operate in the large and growing boutique fitness segment of the broader health and fitness club industry. Boutique fitness encompasses a social, supportive community of coaches and consumers engaging through class-based programming in small studio spaces (typically 1,500-2,500 square feet). A boutique fitness workout typically offers more customized programming and a more intensive experience complemented by increased levels of personal attention and guidance relative to a traditional health and fitness club.
As the largest franchisor in the boutique fitness industry, we saw continued strong growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We opened 1,066 new studios globally between April 2020 and December 2022. Our member base today is approximately 70% larger than it was before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Competitive Strengths
Diversified portfolio of leading boutique fitness brands.
 Our portfolio of ten diversified brands spans a variety of popular fitness and wellness verticals including Pilates, barre, cycling, stretching, rowing, yoga, boxing, dancing, running and functional training. We believe that our diversification represents a significant competitive advantage in a fragmented market comprised primarily of single-brand companies focused on an individual fitness or wellness vertical. The complementary nature of our brands allows our franchised studios to be located in close proximity to one another, providing variety and convenience to both consumers and franchisees. Our brands appeal to a broad range of consumers across ages, fitness levels and demographics and are positioned at an accessible price point. The strength of our brands is highlighted by the numerous accolades they have received, with four brands (Club Pilates, Pure Barre, CycleBar and StretchLab) being listed among Entrepreneur’s 2022 Franchise 500 rankings, four brands (Club Pilates, Pure Barre, StretchLab and YogaSix) being listed among Entrepreneur's 2022 Fastest Growing Franchise rankings, and BFT being voted the 2021 APAC Fit Summit Franchise of the Year. We believe that our diversified brand offering expands our total addressable market and translates into increased use occasions for consumers, driving increased share of wallet and enhancing consumer lifetime value across our portfolio.


Market leading position with significant nationwide scale.
 We are the largest boutique fitness franchisor in the United States with over 2,301 studios operating across ten brands in the United States. Our Pilates, cycling and barre brands have leading market share positions within their respective verticals. These brands, Club Pilates, Pure Barre and CycleBar, were approximately eight, four and four times larger than their next largest competitors, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. As the leaders in these verticals, and as one of few players of scale, we believe that we occupy an advantageous position in an otherwise highly fragmented boutique fitness market.
We are able to leverage the popularity and reputation of existing Xponential studios to support both new studio sales to franchisees and to support franchisees’ ability to attract new customers to their studios. We believe that the continued expansion of the Xponential platform creates a network effect that reinforces our competitive position, making us increasingly attractive to potential franchisees and making studios increasingly popular with boutique fitness consumers. In conjunction with our scale, we have been able to achieve broad geographic diversification across the United States with studios in 48 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2022. Our geographic reach represents a material competitive advantage, as we have demonstrated success across various markets, and we are able to remain competitive nationally when extraordinary events heavily impact specific markets.
 Passionate, growing and loyal consumer base.
 Our franchised studios provide differentiated and accessible boutique fitness experiences that are fun, energetic and deliver a strong sense of community, engendering loyalty and engagement with consumers. Across our system, we had over two million unique consumers and had nearly 40 million in-studio, live stream and virtual workouts completed in 2022. The loyalty of our consumer base is evidenced by our franchisees’ ability to recover to approximately 152% of actively paying members as of December 31, 2022, relative to December 31, 2019 levels and membership visits for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were at 153% relative to the quarter ended December 31, 2019 levels. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, run-rate AUVs recovered to approximately 109% relative to the quarter ended December 31, 2019 (includes Rumble and BFT). We believe that we were able to deepen our consumer loyalty during the COVID-19 pandemic through our robust digital platform offering, as well as the personal efforts of exceptional franchisees to strengthen their studio communities. Our digital platform had 117,800 subscribers and offered over 4,580 digital workouts in our library with multiple class formats within each brand as of December 31, 2022. Approximately 92% of class bookings were done through the Xponential brand app in the 90 days ending December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, studios had over 590,000 members, of which over 530,000 were actively paying members on recurring membership packages. We launched a partnership with Apple in March 2021 that features Apple Watch integration across all of our popular fitness and wellness verticals and is designed to increase consumer engagement and retention across our franchised studios. Our franchised studios foster consumer engagement, personal accountability to achieve fitness goals and a strong sense of community, which drive repeat visits and maximize consumer lifetime value. In September 2022, through our exclusive partnership with Princess Cruises we became the first cross-modality fitness franchise to put its curated brands on a major cruise line. This partnership allows millions of guests the opportunity to experience our brands, except for Rumble and BFT. In addition to the in-studio classes offered onboard, on-demand and live-streamed classes will be made available across Princess’ more than 23,000 staterooms on Princess’ proprietary digital content platform, OceanView. In October 2022, we launched on-demand and live-streamed classes on lululemon Studio, lululemon's smart home gym offering, across four of our brands. The debut on lululemon Studio allows members of lululemon Studio to stream Pure Barre, Rumble, AKT, and YogaSix classes, and sign up for classes at the brands' hundreds of locations across the United States. We believe that our partnership with Apple Watch, Princess Cruises, and lululemon Studio will further drive excitement and enthusiasm across the Xponential consumer base, while also helping to increase membership engagement and retention.
 Xponential Playbook supports system-wide operational excellence.
 We strategically partner with franchisees who have been vetted by a thorough selection process. Through the Xponential Playbook, we provide franchisees with significant support from the outset, focused on delivering a superior experience and maximizing studio-level productivity and profitability. Franchisees also benefit from the significant investments we have made in our corporate platform, through which we leverage integrated systems and shared services. While marketing and fitness programming are specific to each brand, nearly all other franchisee support functions are integrated across brands at the corporate level, and franchisees are guided through the key pillars of successful studio operations.


We believe the relationships we maintain with franchisees drive tangible results for consumers: well-managed boutique fitness studios; access to technology capabilities; retention of highly qualified instructors; and a consistent, community-based experience across brands and geographies. We believe the extensive level of support we provide to franchisees is a key driver of system-wide operational excellence.
 Asset-light franchise model and predictable revenue streams.
 We believe our asset-light franchise model drives faster system-wide unit growth, compared to a similarly capitalized corporate-owned model. As a franchisor, we have multiple highly predictable revenue streams and low ongoing capital requirements. Upon the granting of access to a license, we receive a one-time, non-refundable upfront payment from franchisees for the right to open a studio in a specific territory. This is followed by a series of contractual payments once a studio is open, many of which are recurring, including royalty fees, technology fees, merchandise sales, marketing fees and instructor and management training revenues. Approximately 71% of our revenue in 2022 and 77% of our revenue in 2021 was considered recurring, and we believe this percentage will increase as franchise royalty fees are expected to account for a greater percentage of our revenue over time.
 Highly attractive and predictable studio-level economics.
 The Xponential Playbook is designed to help franchisees achieve compelling AUVs, strong operating margins and an attractive return on their invested capital. Studios are generally designed to be between 1,500 and 2,500 square feet in size, depending on the brand, which contributed to a relatively low weighted average initial franchisee investment of approximately $350,000 in 2022 and 2021. Our model is generally designed to generate, on average under normal conditions, a weighted average AUV of $500,000 in year two of operations and studio-level operating margins ranging between 25% and 30%, resulting in an unlevered cash-on-cash return of approximately 40%. A studio reaches “base maturity” when it has annualized monthly revenues of approximately $400,000. Using our model, we expect this to typically occur 6-12 months after studio opening. We believe that studios typically have opportunity to continue growing and maturing beyond that point.
 We believe the continued growth of the franchisee system reflects the attractiveness of our unit economic model. In 2022 and 2021, 265 and 252 new franchisees joined our system in North America, representing a 5% and 91% increase year-over-year, respectively. The large increase in 2021 was attributed to improvements from challenges faced by the overall fitness industry in 2020 and the first half of 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, franchisees frequently re-invest into our system, as 32% of new studios in 2022 and 33% of new studios in 2021 were opened by existing franchisees. We believe our strong studio-level economics have contributed to our growth.
 Large and expanding franchisee base with visible organic growth.
 Our large number of existing licenses sold represents an embedded pipeline to support the continued growth of our business. As of December 31, 2022, on a cumulative basis since inception, we had 5,450 franchise licenses sold globally, compared to 2,132 franchise licenses sold as of December 31, 2018 on an adjusted basis to reflect historical information of the brands we have acquired. Franchisees are contractually obligated to open studios in their territories after purchasing a franchise license. In the event that franchisees are unable to meet their contractual obligations, we have the ability to resell or reassign their territory license(s) to another franchisee in the system or our franchisee pipeline. Based on our experience as a franchisor, we believe that a significant majority of our licenses sold will convert into operating studios. Accordingly, we have the potential to substantially increase our studio base through our existing licenses sold, providing us with highly visible unit growth and further increasing our already significant scale within the boutique fitness industry.


Proven and experienced management team with an entrepreneurial culture.
 Our strategic vision and entrepreneurial culture are driven by our highly experienced management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer and founder, Anthony Geisler. Mr. Geisler has direct experience scaling franchised fitness brands, having previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of LA Boxing, and has worked with many members of our leadership team for several years. Our Brand Presidents are key members of our leadership team and act as the driving force behind their respective brands. Collectively, our management team fosters an entrepreneurial culture and mentality that resonate with franchisees. The strength of our management team is illustrated by the growth of the business and the recent honors that we and our brands have received, with four brands (Club Pilates, Pure Barre, CycleBar and StretchLab) being listed among Entrepreneur’s 2022 Franchise 500 rankings, four of our brands (Club Pilates, Pure Barre, StretchLab and YogaSix) being listed among Entrepreneur's 2022 Fastest Growing Franchise rankings, and BFT being voted the 2021 APAC Fit Summit Franchise of the Year. Our leadership team has significant experience scaling franchised fitness brands and has created a culture designed to enable our future success.
 Our Growth Strategies
 We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on multiple opportunities to drive the long-term growth of our business:
 Grow our franchised studio base across all brands in North America.
 We have the opportunity to meaningfully expand our franchised studio footprint in North America by leveraging our multiple brands and verticals, as well as our proven portability across regions and demographics.
 We have grown our franchised studio footprint in North America from 1,071 open studios across 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Canada as of December 31, 2018 to 2,329 open studios across 48 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Canada as of December 31, 2022, on an adjusted basis to reflect historical information of the brands we have acquired, representing a CAGR of 21%. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,714 franchisees and licenses for 1,939 studios contractually obligated to be opened under existing franchise agreements in North America. We sold 806 licenses in 2022 compared to 787 licenses in 2021 and 265 licenses in 2020. While we experienced delays in new studio openings in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued opening studios throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and franchisees have opened 801 studios in North America from April 2020 through December 31, 2022. Our track-record of successful expansion demonstrates that the experience and value offered by our brands resonate with consumers across geographies, including urban and suburban markets, ages and income levels. Our small box format and multi-brand model have enabled us to scale rapidly, as franchisees have the ability to open studios from multiple brands adjacent or in close proximity to each other, creating cross-selling opportunities and providing consumers with greater optionality. As we scale, we expect to attract multi-studio franchisees to help us accelerate our pace of growth. Franchisees provide the capital to open each studio location and we provide ongoing support.
 Drive system-wide same store sales and grow AUV.
 We believe we can help franchisees grow same store sales and AUVs by acquiring new consumers, increasing membership penetration, driving increased spend from consumers and expanding ancillary revenue streams through our franchised studios.
 •Acquiring new consumers: We expect to grow our consumer reach through a variety of targeted marketing campaigns at both the brand and franchisee levels to increase brand awareness and drive studio traffic.
 •Increasing membership penetration: We expect franchisees to convert new and occasional consumers into committed, long-term members by delivering consistent, effective workout experiences across our franchised studios. We intend to continue to utilize insights from our consumer management dashboard to refine our sales strategy and offer a variety of flexible membership options to attract consumers at different engagement levels and price points, including our existing four, eight and unlimited classes per month recurring membership options.
 •Driving increased spend from consumers: We expect to increase spend from consumers by utilizing dynamic pricing tiers across markets and brands, up-tiering memberships, cross-selling memberships across our brands, driving further digital penetration and enhancing our membership engagement. We work closely with franchisees to optimize membership offerings based on local consumer demand, demographics and other market factors in order to maximize our share of wallet.


•Utilize XPASS to enhance consumer experience and engagement while more effectively cross-selling across our brands: We implemented XPASS in 2021, a membership option that offers our consumers access to multiple brands across the Xponential portfolio under a single monthly subscription. We believe that XPASS will enable us to continue to attract and retain consumers that are seeking greater variety in their boutique workouts and that we are able to leverage XPASS to introduce consumers to new brands and verticals within our platform.
 •Attract and retain consumers through our digital platform: We believe there is an opportunity to further capitalize on growing consumer demand for digital and at-home fitness solutions by enhancing system-wide capabilities that complement our in-studio offerings. Our digital platform consists of a library of branded content that we make available to our consumers across our online and mobile platforms for a monthly fee. In addition to increasing engagement and retention with our existing in-studio members, our digital platform programs enable us and franchisees to reach new consumers and generate incremental revenues without increasing overhead costs. This enables our brands to deliver high-quality fitness content and maintain strong levels of member engagement, even when studios are closed. Using the experience, knowledge and data we gathered in 2022 and 2021, we are planning to further enhance our production studio, increase production talent and upgrade our content to more closely resemble the in-studio experience at home, so members can experience our brands at any time. Our digital platform offering currently includes all brands. Our new Xponential+ digital platform is expected to significantly enhance our member experience and further increase our brands’ reach, accessibility and subscriber engagement.
 •Expanding additional revenue streams within our franchised studios: We believe we have the opportunity to increase consumer spending at our franchised studios by expanding our offering of branded and third-party retail products across apparel and other health and wellness categories. During government-mandated studio closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, franchisees were able to generate revenue in part through retail sales, including the sale of at-home fitness equipment such as exercise balls and weights. We expect that franchisees will be able to continue to leverage this revenue stream in the future as some consumers may continue to make at-home fitness a complementary component of their health and wellness regimens.
 Expand operating margins.
 We have built our franchised boutique fitness platform across verticals through a series of acquisitions, investments in our brands, corporate infrastructure and leadership team. We expect to realize improved operating leverage and increase operating margins over time as we continue to expand our franchised studio base and leverage our shared services and platform. Our business model provides us with highly predictable and recurring revenue streams, attractive margins and minimal capital requirements, resulting in the ability to invest in future growth initiatives.
 Grow our brands and studio footprint internationally.
 We believe there is significant opportunity for further international growth, underscored by our track-record of successful expansion across a diverse array of North American markets and our expansion into multiple international markets, including the 2021 acquisition of BFT.
We are focused on expanding into territories with attractive demographics, including household income, level of education and fitness participation. We have developed strong relationships and executed master franchise agreements with master franchisees to propel our international growth. These master franchise agreements obligate master franchisees to arrange the sale of licenses to franchisees in one or more countries outside North America. As of December 31, 2022, we had 312 studios open internationally across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Spain, the Dominican Republic, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Master franchisees were contractually obligated to sell licenses to franchisees to open an additional 1,094 studios, of which master franchisees have sold 236 licenses for studios not yet opened as of December 31, 2022.


Our Brands
 We have curated a portfolio of ten brands that span a variety of popular fitness and wellness verticals, including Pilates, barre, cycling, stretching, rowing, yoga, boxing, dancing, running and functional training.

All of our brands offer workouts that can be completed both indoors and outdoors. We have also developed the XPASS, which allows consumers to participate in all of our diversified workout options while enjoying a consistent, high-quality studio experience across brands under a single monthly subscription.
 Franchisees have the opportunity to purchase merchandise for sale in studios and online. To ensure consistency across the studio base, we require franchisees to order merchandise directly from us or approved vendors. Examples of merchandise include at-home fitness equipment such as light weights, exercise mats, balls and exercise bands, fitness apparel, such as leggings and t-shirts, and accessories, such as water bottles and towels. Merchandise is offered from popular athletic retailers, as well as fitness apparel and accessories featuring our brands’ logos and slogans.

 Our Franchise Model
 Franchising Strategy
 We rely on our franchising strategy to grow our brands’ global footprint in a capital efficient manner. Our franchise model leverages the local market expertise of highly motivated owners, our proven Xponential Playbook and our corporate platform. The model has enabled us to scale our system-wide studio footprint globally at a CAGR of 25% from 2018 to 2022.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had sold a total of 4,868 franchise licenses on a cumulative basis since inception in North America, with approximately 19% of licenses owned by single-unit franchisees and approximately 81% of licenses owned by multi-unit franchisees. As of December 31, 2022, 54% of franchisees owned more than one license and about 95% of franchisees owned a single brand of licenses. The largest franchisee in North America owned 89 licenses, representing approximately 1.8% of our total franchise licenses sold in North America as of December 31, 2022.
 When considering potential franchisees, we evaluate their prior experience in relationship-oriented businesses, level of hands-on involvement in their communities, financial history and available capital and financing.
 Franchisee Selection Process
 We created a disciplined and highly effective franchisee development program for our portfolio of brands and franchisees. The franchisee network in North America has grown rapidly from 985 franchisees as of December 31, 2018 to 1,714 franchisees as of December 31, 2022, representing a CAGR of 15%.
When evaluating new potential franchisees in North America, we typically look for the following characteristics:
 •financially qualified individuals;
 •relationship-oriented business background;
 •motivated leaders who are driven by success;
 •passion to help people meet their health and fitness goals; and
 •willingness to implement our model and strategies.


The potential franchisees must also meet the following eligibility criteria:
 •minimum liquidity of $100,000;
 •minimum net worth of $500,000; and
 •financial means to invest between $175,000 to $550,000 to build out their studio, depending on the brand.
 We divide the franchisee selection process into five distinct stages:
 •Inquiry stage: Potential new franchisees complete and submit a confidential questionnaire form to our franchise development team for consideration.
 •Preliminary screening stage: Our franchise development team conducts a call with potential franchisees to determine their level of financial, cultural and geographical fit.
 •Introduction stage: If preliminarily approved, potential franchisees schedule a call with our brand managers to discuss next steps and take part in a number of foundation calls to learn more about the brand.
 •Approval stage: Following validation calls and potential franchisees’ personal due diligence, potential franchisees are invited to a discovery day at our headquarters in Irvine, California to meet with the corporate team as a final step in the approval process.
 •Contract sold stage: Following the completion of the above steps and once internally approved, potential franchisees sign a franchise agreement.
 Franchise Agreements
 For each of our brands’ franchised studios, we enter into a franchise agreement covering standard terms and conditions. Under our franchise agreement, we grant franchisees the right to access our brands in an exclusive area or territory after taking into account population density and demographics based on our internal and third-party analyses. The proposed location must be approved by us, and each franchisee is responsible for the selection, acquisition and development of the site from which to build the studio. Our franchise agreement requires that the franchisee operates within its designated market areas.
 Our franchise agreements have an initial ten-year term. We can terminate the franchise agreement if a franchisee is in default thereunder, has failed to meet our minimum monthly gross revenue quotas or has failed to select a site for the studio that meets our approval within an indicated time period. From inception to December 31, 2022, of our licenses sold, 600 had been terminated in North America and 34 had been terminated internationally. We expect franchisees to meet and maintain minimum monthly gross revenue quotas by the first and second anniversary of their studio opening. Failure to meet these quotas for 36 consecutive months at any time during the term of the franchise agreement can result in the institution of a mandatory corrective training program or termination of the franchise agreement. We require franchisees to open their studio for regular, continuous business within a specified timeline. Within six months of the expiration of the initial ten-year term, franchisees will have the opportunity to renew for one or two additional five-year terms, subject to the terms and conditions prevailing at the time of renewal.
 Our franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with our standard operating methods that govern the provision of services, use of vendors and sale of merchandise. These provisions require that franchisees purchase equipment only from an approved list of vendors, and may generally provide products, classes and services only from us or an approved list of suppliers. We reserve the right to charge a penalty fee for each day that a franchisee offers or sells unauthorized products or services from the studio.
 Our franchise agreements require franchisees to pay an initial, nonrefundable franchise fee per studio.
 Beginning on the day that a studio starts generating revenue from its business operations, franchisees are required to pay us a monthly royalty fee based on gross sales.


Attractive Franchisee Return Profile
 The Xponential Playbook is designed to help franchisees achieve compelling AUVs, strong operating margins and an attractive return on their invested capital. Studios are generally designed to be between 1,500 and 2,500 square feet in size, depending on the brand, which contributed to a relatively low weighted average initial franchisee investment of approximately $350,000 in 2022 and 2021, including all leasehold improvements and required studio furniture, fixtures and equipment. We believe that our scale and vendor relationships enable us to offer equipment and merchandise to franchisees at a significantly lower cost than if they were to acquire it on their own. By utilizing the Xponential Playbook, our model is generally designed to generate, a weighted average AUV of approximately $500,000 in year two of operations and studio-level operating margins ranging between 25% and 30%, resulting in an unlevered cash-on-cash return of approximately 40%.
New Studio Development
 Our small-box format studios have the flexibility to be located in a variety of retail buildings and shopping centers, and we consider locations in both high- and low-density markets. We seek out locations with (i) our target customer demographics, (ii) high visibility and accessibility and (iii) favorable traffic counts and patterns. We use internal and third-party analytic tools to access demographic data that we use to analyze potential new and existing sites and markets for franchisees. We assess population density, current tenant mix, layout and potential competition, among other factors. As a result of boutique fitness consumers’ affinity for trying multiple workout types, we have the ability to place our different brands within close proximity to each other. Our team follows a detailed approval process to review potential sites and seek to ensure that each site aligns with our strategic growth objectives and the Xponential Playbook.
 We guide franchisees through the site selection, build-out and design processes during the development of their studios, ensuring that the studios conform to the physical specifications for their respective brands. Prior to opening, we offer franchisees a list of designated territories in which they may open a new studio. Each franchisee is responsible for selecting, acquiring and leasing a site, but they must obtain site approval from Xponential.
 Franchise Development Team
 We have a dedicated sales team to help promote and coordinate sales and resales of franchises at the corporate level. We have created a scalable and sustainable model through which we identify potential franchisees. In addition, we have a team dedicated to training and supporting franchisees in lead generation, sales conversion and customer retention support.
 We also work with third-party brokers to generate sales leads for potential new franchisees.
 Studios
 As of December 31, 2022, franchisees operated 2,301 studios across 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, 28 studios in Canada and 312 studios internationally. In 2022, franchisees opened 375 studios across North America as well as 136 studios internationally. As of December 31, 2021, franchisees operated 1,932 studios across 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, 22 studios in Canada and 176 studios internationally.
 Operating company-owned studios is not a component of our business model. Following the significant disruption to the global fitness industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we took ownership of a greater number of studios than we would expect to hold in the normal course of our business. While operating studios is not a component of our business model, we currently hold a small number of strategic transition studios as, on occasion, we take ownership of such studios for a limited time while facilitating the transfer of these studios to new or existing franchisees ("company-owned transition studios"). As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we had 55, 25 and 40 company-owned transition studios, representing 2.1%, 1.2% and 2.2% of the global studio base, respectively.

The map below shows open studios by U.S. state as of December 31, 2022:
 



Note: The 55 company-owned transition studios are included in the count of total franchised studios. As we are in the process of refranchising these studios, we expect that they will be owned and operated by franchisees in the future.
 

Brand | Club Pilates | | Pure Barre | CycleBar | StretchLab | | Row House | YogaSix | AKT | | Stride | Rumble | BFT | 
Number of U.S. states | | 44 | | 47 | | 40 | | 39 | | 25 | | 32 | | 15 | 10 | 17 | 2

 We continue to drive the international expansion of our studio base. We currently have in place master franchise and international expansion agreements that grant master franchisees the right to sell licenses to potential franchisees in 14 countries that we have targeted for near-term expansion. As of December 31, 2022, there were 312 studios open internationally, and the master franchisees were contractually obligated to sell licenses to franchisees to open an additional 1,094 studios, of which master franchisees have sold 236 licenses for studios not yet open as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, franchisees were contractually committed to open an additional 1,939 studios in North America under existing franchise agreements.


Fitness Equipment
 Our franchised studios contain state-of-the-art fitness equipment from an array of suppliers. We believe that the quality of the equipment enriches the customers’ in-studio experience and thereby enhances their brand loyalty. To ensure consistency across the studio base, we require franchisees to order equipment and supplies directly from us or approved vendors. Franchisees are required to order replacement or upgraded equipment within five to ten years depending on the manufacturers’ guidelines. Franchisees also must use our approved vendors for equipment maintenance, who provide warranties on certain equipment purchased from them. As the largest franchisor in the industry, we have significant scale that enables us to negotiate competitive pricing from our suppliers. As a result, we believe that we offer equipment at more attractive pricing than franchisees could otherwise procure on their own, lowering the build-out cost and improving unit economics.
Our Digital Offering
 We believe there is an opportunity to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for digital and at-home fitness solutions by providing a digital platform that complements and enhances the attractiveness of our in-studio offerings. In addition to increasing engagement with and retention of our existing in-studio members, our digital platform enables us to reach new consumers in markets without a physical footprint and generate incremental revenue for both us and franchisees with limited incremental cost. As a result, our brands can deliver high-quality fitness content and maintain strong levels of member engagement both in the studio and at home. Our digital offering is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and delivers highly engaging live streamed and on-demand fitness classes from all of our brands. We cover the cost of production for our digital content. Currently, Pure Barre members who purchase an unlimited membership, as well as StretchLab and BFT members that purchase any membership, receive full access to our digital library at no extra charge during the life of their membership. Other members across our brands may purchase a digital subscription from a studio or directly from us. We receive a platform fee from franchisees for each digital subscription that is purchased from a studio.
 As of December 31, 2022, our digital platform had over 117,800 users, of which over 46,600 were paid subscribers and the balance received digital subscriptions as part of an unlimited Pure Barre membership. We offer digital subscriptions on an individual brand basis, as well as an all-access package for eight of our brands. Our digital platform encompasses over 4,500 digital workouts with multiple class formats within each brand, and we expect to continue to grow that content. Our digital platform is attractive for franchisees as it allows them to upsell a better value proposition to their members. It also allows us to market local studios to standalone digital members based on their geographic location. We believe that our digital platform builds significant brand awareness and enhances cross-sell opportunities across our brands and between in-studio memberships and digital subscriptions.
Marketing
 Marketing Strategy
 Our marketing strategy is designed to highlight our leading brand portfolio, the compelling value proposition of our brands and the unique attributes and benefits of boutique fitness workouts. Each brand has a dedicated marketing team that is focused on building brand awareness, generating new customer leads and increasing studio traffic at the national and local level. We leverage our corporate platform and marketing expertise to develop tailored marketing strategies to capitalize on each of our brands’ potential.
Marketing Spending
 National advertising. We manage a marketing fund for franchisees, with the goal of building national awareness for our brands. We focus our marketing efforts on national advertising and media partnerships, developing and maintaining creative assets to support local sales throughout the year, and building and supporting the Xponential Fitness community via digital and social media for each of our brands. Our franchise agreements require franchisees to contribute 2% of their monthly gross sales to the marketing fund of their respective brand. Our marketing funds have enabled us to spend approximately $17.3 million, $13.0 million and $7.1 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to increase national awareness of our brands. We believe this is a powerful marketing tool as it allows us to increase brand awareness in new and existing markets.


Local marketing. Our franchise agreements require franchisees to spend at least $1,500 per month on approved local marketing to support promotional sale periods throughout the year and continue to build the brand in local markets. All franchised studios are supported by our dedicated franchisee marketing team, which provides guidance, tracking, measurement and advice on best practices. Franchisees spend their marketing dollars in a variety of ways to promote business at their studios on a local level. These methods typically include media vehicles that are effective on a local level, including direct mail, outdoor (including billboards), social media and radio advertisements and local partnerships and sponsorships.
 Social media. We have an engaged social media platform for each of our brands, which we believe further raises brand awareness and creates a community among our members. Each brand has a dedicated social media page run by us, and we also maintain a corporate social media page where we seek to engage personally with customers. In addition, franchisees operate social media accounts at the local level. We provide franchisees with social media consulting during the pre-opening phase in order to help them maximize their social impact. We believe that local social media pages are additive to the studio-level community and deepen our brands’ connection with consumers.
 Digital. We utilize digital advertising at the corporate level to drive awareness for our digital platform offerings. For example, in March 2021, we launched an Apple Watch integration designed to offer an enhanced member experience across all our brands. The integration allows Xponential members and guests who own an Apple Watch to view upcoming classes, check-in to a class and track real-time workout performance data. Each brand’s app integrates directly with Apple Watch. Members at participating studios also have the option to join our “Earn Your Watch” challenge, earning back the value of their Apple Watch when they purchase their device through an Xponential brand website and complete a set number of workouts per month. We believe that our partnership with Apple Watch will further drive excitement and enthusiasm across the Xponential consumer base, while also helping to increase membership engagement and retention.
 Competition
 Although we offer boutique fitness experiences, we believe we compete with both fitness and non-fitness consumer discretionary spending alternatives for consumers’ time and resources.
 Franchisees compete with other health and fitness club industry participants, including:
 •other national and regional boutique fitness offerings, some of which are franchised and others of which are owned centrally at a corporate level;
 •other health and fitness centers, including gyms and other recreational facilities;
 •individually owned and operated boutique fitness studios;
 •personal trainers;
 •racquet, tennis and other athletic clubs;
 •at-home fitness offerings;
 •online fitness services and health and wellness apps;
 •participants in the home-use fitness equipment industry; and
 •businesses offering similar services.
 The health and fitness club industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Some of our competitors may have greater name recognition nationally or locally or an established presence in local markets and some have corporate relationships that facilitate their acquisition of new consumers. These risks are more significant internationally, where we have a limited number of studios and brand recognition. Please also see “Business-Our Competitive Strengths.”


We also compete to sell franchises to potential franchisees who may choose to purchase franchises from other boutique fitness operators, but who may also consider purchasing franchises in other industries such as restaurants and personal care. We compete with other franchisors on the basis of the expected return on investment of franchisees and the value propositions that we offer for franchisees.
 Our competition continues to increase as we expand into new markets and add studios in existing markets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors.”
 Suppliers
 We require franchisees to make most purchases related to the build out and operation of their studios from us or our approved vendors. This helps us ensure the timelines of build outs and the maintenance of consistent studio quality within each brand. We sell equipment purchased from third-party equipment manufacturers to franchised studios in North America. Franchisees outside North America must purchase equipment from third-party equipment manufacturers approved by us. We also have various approved suppliers of fitness accessories and apparel.
 Vendors arrange for delivery of products and services either directly to our warehouse or to franchisee studios. We continually re-evaluate our supplier relationships to ensure we and franchisees obtain competitive pricing and high-quality equipment, merchandise and other items.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 400 employees at our corporate headquarters, of which approximately 140 were part-time employees. We also had approximately 970 employees at our company-owned transition studios as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately 920 were part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
 Xponential franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of franchisees are not employees of Xponential Fitness.
 Information Technology and Systems
 We recognize the value of enhancing and extending the uses of information technology (“IT”) in virtually every area of our business. Our IT strategy is aligned to support our business strategy and operating plans. We maintain an ongoing program to monitor, replace or upgrade key IT services and infrastructure.
 The studios use a uniform third-party hosted studio management system for enrolling members and managing member database information including personally identifiable information and payment processing. In addition, this management system tracks and analyzes key operating metrics such as membership statistics, cancellations, cross-studio utilization, member tenure and demographics profiles.
 We continue to create a more customizable and efficient experience for members through updated digital tools, including enhanced websites and mobile applications. These digital tools enable consumers to search studio locations, browse class schedules and sign up for classes. We continue to enhance the accessibility of our digital tools to increase our online presence and member engagement.
Through our third-party hosted studio management system, we provide franchisees access to an informational management system to receive informational notices, operational resources and updates, training materials and other franchisee communications.
 Our back-office computer systems are comprised of a variety of technologies designed to assist the operation of our business. These include a third-party hosted accounting and financial system, a SaaS solutions system to manage franchisees’ leases and franchisee agreements, a third-party hosted payroll system, an inventory and online store management system and a customer relationship management system.


Intellectual Property
 At December 31, 2022, we own approximately 72 registered trademarks and service marks in the United States and approximately 341 registered trademarks and service marks in other countries, including “Xponential,” “Pure Barre,” “StretchLab,” “Row House,” “YogaSix,” “Club Pilates,” “CycleBar,” “Rumble,” “AKT,” “Stride” and “BFT.” We believe the Xponential name, and the marks associated with our ten brands are of value and are important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we pursue registration of our marks in the United States and select international jurisdictions, monitor the use of our marks in the United States and internationally and oppose any unauthorized use of our marks.
 We license the use of our marks to franchisees and third-party vendors through our franchise agreements and vendor agreements. These agreements restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of our marks. Our franchise agreements impose brand standards requirements and require franchisees to inform us of any potential infringement of our marks.
 We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such registered copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
 We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our franchised studios. Such licenses, including our music licenses, are not material to our business. Franchisees also license certain intellectual property for use in their studios, including music in some cases.
 Government Regulation
 We and franchisees are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations affecting our business.
 We are subject to a trade regulation rule on franchising, known as the FTC Franchise Rule, promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), that regulates the offer and sale of franchises in the United States and requires us to provide to all prospective franchisees certain mandatory disclosure in a Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”). In addition, we are subject to state franchise sales laws in approximately 19 U.S. states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to make a business opportunity exemption or franchise filing or obtain franchise registration prior to making any offer or sale of a franchise in those states and to provide a FDD to prospective franchisees.
 We are subject to franchise sales laws in six provinces in Canada that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to provide a FDD in a prescribed format to prospective franchisees and that further regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship. We are also subject to franchise relationship laws in at least 22 U.S. states that regulate many aspects of the franchise relationship, including renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the applicable law and venue in which franchise disputes must be resolved, discrimination and franchisees’ right to associate, among others. In addition, we and franchisees may also be subject to laws in other foreign countries where we or they do business.
 We and franchisees are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, similar state laws in certain jurisdictions, and various other laws in the United States and Canada governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions. A significant number of our and franchisees’ employees are paid at rates related to the U.S. federal or state minimum wage, and past increases in such minimum wages have increased labor costs, as would future increases.
 Our and franchisees’ operations and properties are subject to extensive U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building and zoning requirements. Our and franchisees’ development of properties depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.
 We and franchisees are responsible at the studios we operate for compliance with state laws that regulate the relationship between health clubs and their members. Nearly all states have consumer protection regulations that limit the collection of monthly membership dues prior to a studio opening, require certain disclosure of pricing information, mandate the maximum length of contracts and “cooling off” periods for members (after the purchase of a membership), set escrow and bond requirements, govern member rights in the event of a member relocation or disability, provide specific member rights when a health club closes or relocates, or preclude automatic membership renewals.


We and franchisees primarily accept payments for our memberships through electronic fund transfers from members’ bank accounts and, therefore, are subject to both federal and state legislation and certification requirements, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Some states, such as New York, Massachusetts and Tennessee, have passed or considered legislation requiring gyms and health clubs to offer a prepaid membership option at all times and/or limit the duration for which such memberships can auto-renew through electronic fund transfers, if at all. Our business relies heavily on the fact that our memberships continue on a month-to-month basis after the completion of any initial term requirements, and compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. States that have such health club statutes provide harsh penalties for violations, including membership contracts being void or voidable.
 Additionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by us, or franchisees are regulated at the federal, state and provincial levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry, Security Standards Council, the National Automated Clearing House Association and the Canadian Payments Association. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time to time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to us or franchisees and may impose further restrictions on our or their collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our or their databases. These security requirements and further restrictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), grant protections and causes of action related to consumer data privacy and the methods in which it is collected, stored, used, and disposed by us, our franchisees, and applicable third parties.
