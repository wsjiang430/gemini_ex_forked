ARCALYST is an interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine trap. In 2017, we licensed ARCALYST from Regeneron, who discovered and initially developed the drug. Our exclusive license to ARCALYST from Regeneron includes worldwide rights, excluding the Middle East and North Africa, for all applications other than those in oncology and local administration to the eye or ear. 
​
We received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older in March 2021. Recurrent pericarditis is a painful inflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated U.S. prevalent population of approximately 40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. ARCALYST is commercially available across the United States through a network of distributors. ARCALYST is also approved in the United States for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (“CAPS”) specifically Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome in adults and children 12 years and older, and the maintenance of remission in Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (“DIRA”) in adults and children weighing 10 kg or more. We are responsible for sales and distribution of ARCALYST in all approved indications in the United States, and evenly split profits on sales as well as third-party proceeds with Regeneron. 
​
In February 2022, we granted Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Huadong”) exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan. 
KPL-404 is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD40-CD154 interaction. In 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding securities of Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. (“Primatope”), the company that owned or controlled the intellectual property related to KPL-404. In connection with our acquisition of Primatope, we acquired an exclusive world-wide license to KPL-404 from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. (“BIDMC”). 
The CD40-CD154 interaction is a key T-cell co-stimulatory signal critical for B-cell maturation, immunoglobulin class switching and Type 1 immune response. We believe disrupting the CD40-CD154 interaction is an attractive approach to address multiple autoimmune disease pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), Sjogren’s syndrome, Graves’ disease and systemic lupus erythematosus.
In May 2021, we announced positive final data from our Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of KPL-404 in healthy volunteers, which evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as receptor occupancy and T-cell dependent antibody response. In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of KPL-404 in RA, which is designed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy with subcutaneous administration. In January 2023, we announced that we had completed enrollment of the second and final cohort of the multiple ascending dose portion of such trial. Following completion of this portion of the trial, the proof-of-concept portion will begin. We expect data from the trial in the first half of 2024.
Mavrilimumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor targeting granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor alpha (“GM-CSFRα”). In 2017, we licensed exclusive worldwide rights in all indications to mavrilimumab from MedImmune, Limited (“MedImmune”). 
We are pursuing collaborative study agreements to evaluate the potential of mavrilimumab in rare cardiovascular diseases where the GM-CSF mechanism has been implicated. We previously evaluated mavrilimumab in giant cell arteritis (“GCA”), a chronic inflammatory disease of the medium-to-large arteries, and COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”). 
In February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan. 
Vixarelimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of signaling through oncostatin M receptor beta (“OSMRβ”), which was previously part of our portfolio of immune-modulating assets. In September 2022, we closed an agreement granting Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (collectively, “Genentech”) an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize vixarelimab. Pursuant to such agreement, we have agreed to complete our in-progress Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial of vixarelimab for the treatment of prurigo nodularis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition.

Our Products
ARCALYST
Overview
ARCALYST is an interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine trap. Cytokines are small proteins that play a role in cell signaling. 
We received FDA approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older in March 2021. ARCALYST is also approved in the United States for the treatment of CAPS, specifically Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome in adults and children 12 years and older, and the maintenance of remission in DIRA in adults and children weighing 10 kg or more. ARCALYST was sold by Regeneron in the United States for the treatment of CAPS from 2008 and DIRA from 2020 until we assumed responsibility for sales in such indications in March 2021.
Recurrent pericarditis is a painful autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated U.S. prevalent population of approximately 40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. We received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis in 2019, Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for ARCALYST for the treatment of pericarditis, which includes the treatment of recurrent pericarditis, in 2020 and FDA approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older in March 2021. Additionally, in 2021, the European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation to ARCALYST for the treatment of idiopathic pericarditis.
In June 2020, we reported final results from RHAPSODY, our global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal design, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY met its prespecified primary and all major secondary efficacy endpoints with statistical significance, showing that ARCALYST improved clinically meaningful outcomes associated with unmet medical need in recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY data were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously with a late-breaking scientific presentation at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2020. In November 2022, data from the long-term extension portion of the RHAPSODY trial were presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions which demonstrated, among other things, that continued ARCALYST treatment beyond 18 months resulted in continued treatment response. 
In February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan.

Mechanism of Action
ARCALYST is an inhibitor of IL-1α and IL-1β. IL-1α and IL-1β have been demonstrated to play a key role in inflammatory diseases. IL-1α and IL-1β provoke potent, proinflammatory events by engaging the IL-1α and IL-1β receptor. Following tissue insult, the release of IL-1α acts as the primary initiating signal to coordinate the mobilization of immune cells to the damaged area, while IL-1β is secreted mostly by macrophages and is a prototypical cytokine of the canonical NLRP-3 inflammasome. IL-1α and IL-1β signaling results in a dramatic increase in the production of cytokines that orchestrate the proliferation and recruitment of phagocytes to the site of damage, resulting in inflammation. Moreover, IL-1α and IL-1β signaling also affects other immune system cells, such as T-cells and B-cells.
IL-1β’s role in the inflammation process has been extensively studied, while, in comparison, much is still unknown about the independent function of IL-1α in disease pathology. Despite driving similar immunological outcomes, IL-1α and IL-1β differ substantially in their expression and regulation, and non-redundant roles for IL-1α or IL-1β have been demonstrated in multiple inflammatory diseases. There are disease states in which IL-1β inhibition alone does not appear to be sufficient for disease remission in the absence of IL-1α inhibition. Published studies suggest certain autoinflammatory diseases may, in fact, be pathologically driven primarily by IL-1α.
We believe that inhibiting both IL-1α and IL-1β signaling is important for treating recurrent pericarditis. In a published case study, a patient with a refractory form of recurrent pericarditis, who was well controlled on anakinra, was switched from anakinra to canakinumab, which inhibits only IL-1β, for tolerability reasons. The patient’s disease returned despite further dose escalation of canakinumab. When the patient was switched back to anakinra, which inhibits ILα and ILβ, the disease promptly went back into remission. These data, together with clinical data from our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST, indicate that IL-1α and IL-1β play unique roles in recurrent pericarditis and other autoinflammatory diseases in which the pathology may be driven primarily by IL-1α.
Beyond recurrent pericarditis, we believe there is significant potential for ARCALYST to address additional indications. For example, we believe there are other diseases of the cardiovascular system where tissue inflammation may be driven by IL-1α or IL-1β. More generally, we believe there may be many diseases characterized by painful serosal inflammation that may be driven by IL-1α, and we intend to consider development of ARCALYST in these indications and in others where we believe IL-1α and/or IL-1β plays a key role in disease pathophysiology.
Background and Market Opportunity for Recurrent Pericarditis
Pericarditis is the most common disorder involving the pericardium, the two-layered sac that surrounds the heart. Pericarditis is an inflammation of this sac and is typically characterized by significant chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing and fatigue and is often misconstrued by patients as a heart attack. In addition, typical signs of pericarditis include pericardial friction rub, electrocardiogram changes or pericardial effusion, which is a buildup of fluid around the heart. Pericarditis is described as recurrent if, following an initial occurrence of pericarditis, it recurs after a symptom-free period of about four to six weeks. Pericarditis is considered chronic if symptoms of any one episode last longer than three months, typically causing significant pain and frustration. If pericarditis is left untreated, patients can develop thickening and scarring of the pericardium, potentially requiring invasive surgical stripping. Pericardial effusion, if large enough, can compress the heart extrinsically, requiring emergent drainage.
In March 2021, we received FDA approval to market ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and we are exploring opportunities for potential expansion into other countries. Claims analysis, cross validated with published estimates, support a prevalent population of patients with recurrent pericarditis seeking and receiving medical treatment to be approximately 40,000 patients in the United States per year. Within this estimated diagnosed and treated recurrent pericarditis patient population, there are certain subgroups of patients totaling approximately 14,000 in the U.S. who suffer from persistent underlying disease, multiple recurrences and an inadequate response to conventional therapy who serve as our core target patient population.

Current Treatment Landscape for Recurrent Pericarditis and Our Solution
ARCALYST, a weekly, subcutaneously injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL-1α and IL-1β signaling, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for recurrent pericarditis. A patient’s initial acute episode of pericarditis is typically treated with over-the-counter or prescription NSAIDs or colchicine, both of which are used off-label. Prior to ARCALYST’s approval, episodes of recurrent pericarditis would usually have been treated in a similar manner or by adding systemic corticosteroids which were also used off-label. Both colchicine and corticosteroids often have deleterious effects when used at high doses or for long periods of time, including, for colchicine, gastrointestinal distress and neutropenia and, for corticosteroids, glaucoma, fluid retention, hypertension, mood changes, memory changes, other psychological effects, weight gain and diabetes. 
Clinical Trials
In June 2020, we reported final results from RHAPSODY, our global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal design, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY met its prespecified primary and all major secondary efficacy endpoints with statistical significance. Median [95% CI] time to pericarditis recurrence for ARCALYST recipients in the randomized withdrawal period could not be estimated due to the low number of recurrences in the ARCALYST treatment arm. The median time-to-recurrence for placebo recipients was 8.6 [4.0-11.7] weeks (Hazard Ratio = 0.04, p<0.0001). ARCALYST recipients experienced a 96% reduction in risk of recurrent pericarditis events. 81% of ARCALYST recipients maintained clinical response at Week 16 of the randomized withdrawal period, compared to 20% of placebo recipients (p=0.0002). Consistent results were observed at Week 8 and Week 24 and were also highly statistically significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.0022, respectively). The proportion of ARCALYST recipients with absent or minimal pericarditis symptoms at Week 16 of the randomized withdrawal period was 81% compared to 25% for placebo recipients (p=0.0006). Finally, consistent results were observed at Week 8 and Week 24 and were also highly statistically significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002, respectively). We believe these data show that ARCALYST demonstrates clinically meaningful outcomes associated with unmet medical need in recurrent pericarditis.
In November 2022, data from the long-term extension (“LTE”) portion of the RHAPSODY trial were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2022. LTE data included in the presentation demonstrated continued ARCALYST treatment beyond 18 months resulted in continued treatment response. The median [maximum at end of LTE] duration of continuous rilonacept therapy for all patients in RHAPSODY was 23 [35] months; the median [maximum at end of LTE] duration of continuous rilonacept therapy was 18 months [27] months for US patients (n=45) and 29 [35] months for non-US patients (n=29). The annualized incidence of pericarditis recurrences while on therapy for all patients (n=74) during the first 18 months of the LTE portion of the trial was 0.04 events per patient-year (compared to 4.4 events per patient-year prior to study entry). Patients (n = 52) were given the option at 18 months from their most recent pericarditis recurrence to continue or suspend rilonacept treatment for observation. There were 33 patients who elected to continue ARCALYST treatment, and the only recurrence in this group was associated with a treatment interruption of 4 weeks. Of the patients who suspended treatment (n=8), 75% (n=6) experienced pericarditis recurrences. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] time-to-event was 11.8 [3.7, Not-Estimable (NE)] weeks. The 98% reduction in risk of recurrent pericarditis events in patients who continued rilonacept treatment beyond 18 months (Hazard Ratio = 0.02, p<0.0001) was consistent with the results of the randomized withdrawal period.
Commercial Strategy for ARCALYST 
Since our commercial launch of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis in 2021, we have developed a focused and targeted commercial strategy that vertically integrates multiple key functions. Our specialty salesforce of approximately 50 representatives as of December 31, 2022 calls on high-volume accounts and prescribers. Our salesforce is complemented by our medical affairs, payor and patient services teams who work to ensure broad patient access to ARCALYST, educate communities, collaborate with patient advocacy groups and drive scientific understanding of recurrent pericarditis. Further, we have established an efficient marketing effort intended to help spread awareness of ARCALYST and recurrent pericarditis among prescribers and patients. 

11



Through a data-driven market assessment, we have developed what we believe to be an efficient commercial model built around four key strategic imperatives. The first strategic imperative is establishing the unmet need for recurrent pericarditis patients and working to ensure recurrent pericarditis is viewed as a serious, debilitating disease that is driven primarily by IL-1. The second strategic imperative is working to ensure ARCALYST is viewed as the product of choice for the treatment and reduction in risk of recurrent pericarditis in patients over 12 years of age. The third strategic imperative relates to reimbursement and working to ensure broad patient access at a price that reflects ARCALYST’s value as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for recurrent pericarditis. The fourth and final strategic imperative is building robust patient support programs to optimize patient experiences with ARCALYST and Kiniksa. Overall, our efforts are focused on programs and tactics to help with uptake and adoption of ARCALYST as well as ensuring a positive patient experience.
Our Product Candidates
KPL-404
Overview
KPL-404 is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD40-CD154 interaction. CD40-CD154 interaction is a key T-cell co-stimulatory signal critical for B-cell maturation, immunoglobulin class switching, and Type 1 immune response. 
In May 2021, we reported positive final data from our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of KPL-404 in healthy volunteers which evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as RO, and TDAR in these subjects. KPL-404 showed dose-dependent increases in concentration across cohorts. All dose escalations occurred as per protocol with no dose-limiting safety findings. KPL-404 was well-tolerated, and there were no serious adverse reactions. Subjects dosed with KPL-404 10 mg/kg IV showed full RO through at least Day 71 and complete suppression of TDAR after keyhole limpet hemocyanin (“KLH”), challenge and re-challenge through at least Day 57. Subjects dosed subcutaneously with KPL-404 5 mg/kg showed full RO through Day 43 and suppression of TDAR after KLH challenge through at least Day 29.
​
We are enrolling and dosing participants in a Phase 2 clinical trial of KPL-404 in rheumatoid arthritis, which is designed to enable its potential development in a spectrum of autoimmune diseases believed to be mediated by the CD40-CD154 co-stimulatory interaction. In January 2023, we announced that we had completed enrollment of the second and final cohort of the multiple ascending dose portion of such trial. Following completion of this portion of the trial, the proof-of-concept portion will begin. We expect data from the trial in the first half of 2024.
​
Mechanism of Action 
KPL-404 is designed to block CD40-CD154 interaction by binding to and inhibiting signaling through the CD40 receptor. CD40 is a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor superfamily which is constitutively or inducibly expressed on the surface of a variety of immune and non-immune cell types including B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes and can also be upregulated on other cell types in the context of autoimmune disease. Interactions between B cell-expressed CD40 and its binding partner, CD40L, mainly expressed on activated CD4+ T cells, play a critical role in promoting germinal center formation and the production of class-switched antibodies. The role of CD40 in B cells has been extensively characterized and has been shown to be essential for productive primary and secondary humoral immune responses to T dependent antigens. External clinical data that point to the broad potential power of the mechanism has been established in RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren’s syndrome and Graves’ disease. Ongoing Phase 2 trials from competitors implicate additional indications for potential development, including type 1 diabetes, prevention of liver transplant rejection, hidradenitis suppurativa, lupus nephritis and multiple sclerosis. 

12



Our Solution
KPL-404 inhibits CD40-CD154 interaction with low-single digit nanomolar affinity in vitro. The presentation of KPL-404 is as a high-concentration, liquid formulation, which we believe may allow for a higher delivered dose in one subcutaneous injection than all other competitors whose formulations are limited mainly to high dose IV or lower-dose subcutaneous administration. We believe some competitor assets do not fully antagonize signaling as evidenced by efficacy failures and the generation of anti-drug antibodies even at maximum delivered and/or attainable dose levels.
Clinical and Preclinical Trials
Preclinical Development
​
In preclinical development, KPL-404 has been observed to have a favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicology profile and has shown activity in multiple non-human primate models of organ transplant rejection, as well as in multiple TDAR models. The data in the graphs below show in a non-human primate TDAR model that KPL-404 had linear pharmacokinetics with low variability which translated into complete suppression of antibody responses to a novel antigen (KLH) at drug levels achieving 100% receptor occupancy.
​
Phase 1 Clinical Trial
We previously conducted a Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial of KPL-404, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose, first-in-human study that was divided into two parts: a single dose of KPL-404 0.03 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV and a single dose of KPL-404 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg subcutaneously administered to separate cohorts of healthy volunteers. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of KPL-404. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, CD40 RO, the immune response to the novel test antigen KLH in clinically relevant dose cohorts, and the anti-drug antibody response.
In May 2021, we reported final results from this Phase 1 trial of KPL-404, which met both its primary objective and secondary endpoints. Results from the trial included the following:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 2 Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
In December 2021, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial of KPL-404 in RA. The Phase 2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to provide pharmacokinetic data and early signal of efficacy with chronic administration, and optionality to evaluate KPL-404 across a range of other autoimmune diseases. The trial is expected to enroll participants with active RA who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant to a Janus kinase inhibitor (a “JAKi”) or at least one biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (a “bDMARD”). Subjects who have failed both bDMARD and JAKi are excluded from the study. Cohorts 1 and 2 will each sequentially randomize eight participants in a 6:2 ratio to receive KPL-404 (2mg/kg or 5mg/kg, respectively) or placebo as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints for Cohorts 1 and 2 will be to evaluate pharmacokinetic data across dosing levels and to collect the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. In November, 2022, we disclosed that we had amended the trial to (a) eliminate a 10 mg/kg biweekly subcutaneous dose arm from the multiple-ascending dose portion of the trial (i.e., removing the original Cohort 3 from the trial) and (b) replace the 10 mg/kg biweekly subcutaneous dose arm of the proof-of-concept portion of the trial with a 5 mg/kg weekly subcutaneous dose arm (the revised Cohort 3). Cohort 3 will randomize up to 75 participants in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive KPL-404 5 mg/kg or placebo as a subcutaneous injection every week or 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The participants receiving KPL-404 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks will receive weekly administrations of alternating active investigational product and matching blinded placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for Cohort 3 will be the change in baseline in DAS28-CRP at Week 12. Secondary endpoints for Cohort 3 will be the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and to evaluate pharmacokinetic data across dose levels. We expect data from the trial in the first half of 2024.
Mavrilimumab
Overview
Mavrilimumab is a fully-human monoclonal antibody that is designed to antagonize GM-CSF signaling by binding to the alpha subunit of the GM-CSF receptor. 
We are pursuing collaborative study agreements to evaluate the potential of mavrilimumab in rare cardiovascular diseases where the GM-CSF mechanism has been implicated. 
​

We previously evaluated mavrilimumab in COVID-19-related ARDS. Following the announcement that the Phase 3 portion of our global, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of mavrilimumab in COVID-19-related ARDS did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint in December 2021, we decided not to progress mavrilimumab in such indication at that time.
We also previously evaluated mavrilimumab in GCA, a chronic inflammatory disease of the medium-to-large arteries with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 75,000 to 150,000 patients. In October 2020, we announced that our global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the study of mavrilimumab in GCA achieved both the primary efficacy endpoint of time-to-first adjudicated GCA flare by Week 26 in all treated participants and the secondary efficacy endpoint of sustained remission at Week 26 in all treated participants with statistical significance. Additionally, while the trial was not powered for individual disease cohorts, there was a consistent trend of efficacy across the new onset and relapsing/refractory cohorts. In September 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for mavrilimumab for the treatment of GCA. In February 2022, we announced that we do not plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial of mavrilimumab in GCA.
Before we licensed mavrilimumab in 2017, MedImmune was developing mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA. MedImmune had received authorization to conduct clinical trials for RA in Europe and executed an extensive Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical program in which the company studied mavrilimumab in over 550 participants with RA through Phase 2b. MedImmune’s clinical trials in RA through Phase 2b achieved their prospectively defined endpoints of efficacy or safety.
In February 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan.
Mechanism of Action
Literature data implicate GM-CSF as a key player in the immune system: enhancing trafficking of myeloid cells through activated endothelium of blood vessels and contributing to monocyte and macrophage accumulation in blood vessels during inflammation; promoting activation, differentiation, survival and proliferation of monocytes and macrophages, as well as resident tissue macrophages in inflamed tissues; promoting the differentiation of effector T cells at inflamed sites and draining lymph nodes; and regulating the phenotype of antigen presenting cells in inflamed tissues by promoting the differentiation of infiltrating monocytes into M1 macrophages and monocyte derived dendritic cells (“MoDCs”). These studies have demonstrated that with GM-CSF overexpression, pathological changes almost always follow.
Our Solution
Mavrilimumab is designed to inhibit the signaling of GM-CSF, a growth factor that stimulates the production of certain types of white blood cells. In an ex vivo GCA artery culture model, mavrilimumab inhibited inflammatory molecules characteristic of GCA pathophysiology: Inhibition of the GM-CSFR pathway was confirmed by significant decreases in PU.1 mRNA levels; inhibition of related immune pathways was demonstrated by significant decreases in mRNA for TNFα and CXCL10 mRNA as well as decreases in CXCL10 protein and mRNA levels. The observed significant decrease in IL-6 protein levels was consistent with the decrease in IL-6 mRNA levels observed with mavrilimumab treatment in RA participants in Phase 2.
Discovery Activities
We conduct internal discovery activities directed toward wholly owned molecules for the treatment of debilitating disease targets where we believe there to be a strong mechanistic rationale and potential for clear differentiation from existing approved agents or those in development.

Out-Licensing Agreements
Genentech Agreement
In August 2022 we entered into a license agreement (the “Genentech License Agreement”) with Genentech, pursuant to which we granted Genentech exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize vixarelimab and related antibodies (each, a “Genentech Licensed Product”). The Genentech License Agreement became effective in September 2022 following termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act.
Under the Genentech License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $80.0 million for the license. In the first quarter of 2023, following our last delivery of certain drug supplies to Genentech, Genentech became obligated to make an additional cash payment of $20.0 million. In addition, we will be eligible to receive up to approximately $600.0 million in contingent payments, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, before fulfilling our upstream financial obligations. We will also be eligible to receive tiered percentage royalties on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product basis ranging from low-double digits to mid-teens on annual net sales of each Genentech Licensed Product, subject to certain customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor, before fulfilling our upstream financial obligations. Royalties will be payable on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of certain patents that cover a Genentech Licensed Product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such Genentech Licensed Product, or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such Genentech Licensed Product in such country.
Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech has the exclusive worldwide right to conduct development and commercialization activities for Genentech Licensed Products at its sole cost. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are responsible, at our sole cost, for continuing to conduct and finalize our Phase 2b clinical trial assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of vixarelimab in reducing pruritis in prurigo nodularis. We and Genentech participate in a joint transition committee, which coordinates and oversees the technology and inventory transition activities relating to the development of the Genentech Licensed Products and our conduct and finalization of the Phase 2b clinical trial.
Genentech has the right, for a specified period of time, to purchase an additional batch of vixarelimab drug substance under the Genentech License Agreement at cost plus a markup. Under the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech has the right to assume manufacturing responsibilities for Genentech Licensed Products.

Genentech has the right to terminate the Genentech License Agreement at its discretion with prior written notice and either party may terminate the Genentech License Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency of the other party. In addition, the Genentech License Agreement will terminate upon termination of the Biogen Agreement (as defined below).
Huadong Collaboration Agreements
In February 2022 we entered into two collaboration and license agreements (each, a “Huadong Collaboration Agreement” and together, the “Huadong Collaboration Agreements”) with Huadong, pursuant to which we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST and develop, manufacture and commercialize mavrilimumab (each, a “Huadong Licensed Product” and together, the “Huadong Licensed Products”) in the following countries: People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, Taiwan Region, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, The Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam (collectively, the “Huadong Territory”). We otherwise retain our current rights to the Huadong Licensed Products outside the Huadong Territory.
Under the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, we received a total upfront cash payment of $22.0 million, which includes $12.0 million for the Huadong Territory license of ARCALYST and $10.0 million for the Huadong 

16



Territory license of mavrilimumab. We will be eligible to receive up to approximately $70.0 million in payments for ARCALYST, and up to approximately $576.0 million in payments for mavrilimumab, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. Huadong will also be obligated to pay us tiered percentage royalties on a Huadong Licensed Product-by-Huadong Licensed Product basis ranging from the low-teens to low-twenties on annual net sales of each Huadong Licensed Product in the Huadong Territory, subject to certain reductions tied to ARCALYST manufacturing costs and certain other customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor. Royalties will be payable on a Huadong Licensed Product-by-Huadong Licensed Product and country-by-country or region-by-region basis until the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, (ii) the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim of our patent rights or any joint collaboration patent rights that covers the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, and (iii) the expiration of the last regulatory exclusivity for the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such country or region in the Huadong Territory.
Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, Huadong has the exclusive right to conduct Huadong Territory-specific development activities for the Huadong Licensed Products in the Huadong Territory, the first right to support global development of the Huadong Licensed Products by serving as the sponsor of the global clinical trials conducted in the Huadong Territory and the exclusive right to commercialize the Huadong Licensed Products in the Huadong Territory. Huadong will be responsible for all costs of development activities and commercialization in the Huadong Territory. We and Huadong participate in a joint steering committee, which coordinates and oversees the exploitation of the Huadong Licensed Products in the Huadong Territory.
We will supply certain materials to support development and commercialization activities for both mavrilimumab and ARCALYST. Under the Huadong Collaboration Agreement for mavrilimumab, Huadong has the right to assume manufacturing responsibilities for materials in the Huadong Territory. Under the Huadong Collaboration Agreement for ARCALYST, Huadong does not have rights to perform manufacturing activities in the Huadong Territory.
Absent early termination, each Huadong Collaboration Agreement will continue on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis until there are no more royalty payments owed to us in such country or region for the applicable Huadong Licensed Product. Huadong has the right to terminate each Huadong Collaboration Agreement at its discretion upon 12 months’ notice and either party may terminate the applicable Huadong Collaboration Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the applicable Huadong Collaboration Agreement if Huadong or its affiliates or sublicensees challenges the scope, validity, or enforceability of our patent rights being licensed to Huadong. If Huadong and its affiliates do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities with respect to a Huadong Licensed Product in the People’s Republic of China for a continuous period of longer than six months, then, subject to certain exceptions, we may terminate the Huadong Collaboration Agreement applicable to such Huadong Licensed Product with 60 days’ prior written notice. In addition, Huadong’s rights under each Huadong Collaboration Agreement in certain regions within the Huadong Territory may be subject to termination upon failure by Huadong to perform certain clinical, development or commercialization activities, as applicable, with respect to the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such regions.
In-Licensing Agreements
License Agreement with Regeneron
In September 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Regeneron (the “Regeneron Agreement”). Pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement, we have an exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by Regeneron to develop and commercialize ARCALYST worldwide, excluding the Middle East and North Africa, for all indications other than those in oncology and local administration to the eye or ear. Upon receiving positive data in RHAPSODY, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST, Regeneron transferred the biologics license application (“BLA”) for ARCALYST to us. In March 2021, when the FDA granted approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older, we assumed the sales and distribution of ARCALYST for CAPS and DIRA in the United States.
17



Under the Regeneron Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $5.0 million. In addition, we made a $7.5 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2020 in connection with the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone event and a regulatory milestone payment of $20.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. We evenly split profits on sales of ARCALYST with Regeneron, where profits are determined after deducting from net sales of ARCALYST certain costs related to the manufacturing and commercialization of ARCALYST. Such costs include but are not limited to (i) our cost of goods sold for product used, sold or otherwise distributed for patient use by us; (ii) customary commercialization expenses, including the cost of our field force, and (iii) our cost to market, advertise and otherwise promote ARCALYST, with such costs identified in subsection (iii) subject to specified limits. In addition, should there be a transfer of technology related to the manufacture of ARCALYST, then, to the extent permitted in accordance with the Regeneron Agreement, the fully-burdened costs of each of us and Regeneron incurred in performing (or having performed) such technology transfer shall also be deducted from net sales of ARCALYST to determine profit. We also evenly split with Regeneron any proceeds received by us from any licensees, sublicensees and distributors in consideration for the sale, license or other disposition of rights with respect to ARCALYST, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties.
Regeneron has a right of first negotiation over our engagement of any third party to support our promotional activities in excess of a specified level and over the assignment or sale of our rights to any product we develop under the Regeneron Agreement to a third party. In addition, we will need Regeneron’s prior written consent for the sublicense of certain rights to a third party, provided that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to the sublicensing of rights outside of the United States. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we will need Regeneron’s prior consent to assign our rights under the Regeneron Agreement.
The Regeneron Agreement will expire on the date on which we, our affiliates or sublicensees are no longer developing or commercializing any product containing ARCALYST. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time with one year’s written notice. We may also terminate with three months’ written notice if we reasonably determine that ARCALYST is unsafe in the indications we are pursuing. Regeneron may terminate the agreement if there is a consecutive twelve month period during which we do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities or we do not grant a sublicense to a third party to do so, or if we challenge Regeneron’s patent rights in any country in our territory. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment-related breaches), or by either party due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
We have also entered into a commercial supply agreement with Regeneron (the “Supply Agreement”). Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, Regeneron has the exclusive right to manufacture and supply all of our requirements of ARCALYST for development or commercialization activities. The Supply Agreement terminates upon the termination of the Regeneron Agreement or the date of completion of the transfer of technology related to the manufacture of ARCALYST.
License Agreement with MedImmune
In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with MedImmune (the “MedImmune Agreement”), pursuant to which MedImmune granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights to make, use, develop and commercialize mavrilimumab and any other product containing an antibody to the GM-CSF receptor alpha that is covered by certain MedImmune patent rights for all indications. We also acquired non-exclusive licenses to other MedImmune technology for use in exploiting licensed products. We also acquired reference rights to relevant manufacturing and regulatory documents, and MedImmune’s existing inventory of mavrilimumab drug substance and product. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products.
Under the MedImmune Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $8.0 million. In addition, we made a $5.0 million pass-through payment and a $10.0 million milestone payment in the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the achievement of specified clinical milestone events achieved during the year ended December 31, 2018. We are also obligated to make future clinical, regulatory and initial sales milestone payments of up to $57.5 million in the aggregate for the first two indications. In addition, we are also obligated to make future clinical and regulatory milestone payments 

18



of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate for each subsequent indication. In July 2020, we entered into an amendment to the MedImmune Agreement to establish a new coronavirus field and defer the payment of certain development and regulatory milestones as applied to the new coronavirus field. We are obligated to make milestone payments to MedImmune of up to $85.0 million upon the achievement of annual net sales thresholds up to, but excluding, $1.0 billion in annual net sales as well as additional milestone payments aggregating up to $1.1 billion upon the achievement of additional specified annual net sales thresholds starting at $1.0 billion and higher. Commencing on the first commercial sale of licensed products, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products starting in the low double-digit percentages and ending at twenty percent. We must pay such royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of licensed patents, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Royalty rates are subject to reductions upon certain events.
The MedImmune Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the royalty term in the last country for the last indication, as defined in the agreement. Either party may terminate the MedImmune Agreement upon the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy or for material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days. MedImmune has the right to terminate the MedImmune agreement if we challenge any of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. 
Biogen Asset Purchase Agreement
In September 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Biogen Agreement”) with Biogen MA Inc. (“Biogen”) to acquire all of Biogen’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets used in or relating to vixarelimab and other antibodies covered by certain patent rights, including patents and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, know-how and inventory (the “Acquired Biogen Assets”). In addition, Biogen granted us a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain background patent rights related to the vixarelimab program. Under the Biogen Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the Acquired Biogen Assets.
Under the Biogen Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $11.5 million and a technology transfer payment of $0.5 million to Biogen. In addition, we made a milestone payments in each of 2017 and 2019 totaling $14.3 million and are obligated to make additional milestone payments for each antibody product that includes the Acquired Biogen Assets (each, a “Biogen Antibody Product” and, together, “Biogen Antibody Products”), of up to $315.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified milestones. These milestone payments relate to multiple indications for a Biogen Antibody Product, and are comprised of up to $165.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestone events and $150.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified annual net sales milestones. Commencing on the first commercial sale of a Biogen Antibody Product, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products starting in the high single-digit percentages and ending below the teens. We must pay such royalties on a Biogen Antibody Product-by-Biogen Antibody Product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of patents that cover a Biogen Antibody Product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such product in such country. We have also agreed to pay certain obligations under third-party contracts retained by Biogen that relate to vixarelimab.
Under the Biogen Agreement, Biogen has a time-limited right of first negotiation to purchase the assets we acquired from Biogen or obtain a license to exploit Biogen Antibody Products, in each case, in the event we decide to sell the Acquired Biogen Assets, including through the sale of our company, or out-license the rights to the Biogen Antibody Products.
The Biogen Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all payment obligations in all countries related to the last Biogen Antibody Product subject to the Biogen Agreement. The Biogen Agreement may be terminated by us with 90 days’ prior notice, by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment-related breaches) or by both parties upon mutual consent. In the event of a termination, the Acquired Biogen Assets, including certain licenses and rights related thereto, will revert to Biogen, and, upon written request by Biogen, we are required to grant to Biogen an exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable license to certain of our intellectual property related to the Acquired Biogen Assets, including know-how and patent rights.

19



In July 2017, we and Biogen entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Biogen Agreement, which clarified the scope of the antibodies subject to the Biogen Agreement.
In August 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Biogen Agreement (the “Second Biogen Amendment”). Pursuant to the terms of the Second Biogen Amendment, commencing on the effective date of the Genentech License Agreement, certain defined terms in the Biogen Agreement were amended, including “Net Sales”, “Indication”, “Product”, “Combination Product” and “Valid Claim”. In addition, the tiered royalty rates to be paid by us to Biogen increased by an amount equal to less than one percent.
Upon the termination or expiration of the Genentech License Agreement, the amendments to the terms of the Biogen Agreement, as set forth in the Second Biogen Amendment, will terminate and all terms of the Biogen Agreement will revert to the version of such terms in effect as of immediately prior to the effective date of the Genentech License Agreement.
Primatope Stock Purchase Option Agreement
In September 2017, we entered into a stock purchase option agreement (the “Primatope Agreement”) with Primatope, pursuant to which we were granted a license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Primatope to research, develop, and manufacture the preclinical antibody, KPL-404, and an exclusive call option through April 2018 to purchase all of the outstanding securities of Primatope with up to three extensions periods through mid-January 2019. Upon execution of the agreement, we made $0.5 million in upfront payments for the initial option period and we made payments totaling $0.8 million for extending option period through mid-January 2019. During the option periods, we conducted research and preclinical work to assess the viability of the program.
In January 2019, we exercised the call option and in March 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding securities of Primatope (the “Primatope Acquisition”). The aggregate amount of upfront and contingent payments we paid to the former Primatope shareholders to acquire Primatope was comprised of (i) $15.0 million paid at closing in March 2019, comprised of upfront consideration of $10.0 million and milestone payments of $5.0 million which had been achieved as of the closing date, and (ii) $3.0 million paid in June 2019 for the final milestone payment, which was achieved following the closing during the six months ended June 30, 2019, each paid in a combination of cash and our Class A common shares (inclusive of escrow and holdback share amounts) in accordance with the Primatope Agreement. We released the escrow and issued Class A common shares that were held back at closing in June 2020 and issued the Class A common shares that were held back at the final milestone payment in September 2020.
As a result of the Primatope Acquisition, we acquired the rights to an exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights controlled by BIDMC to make, use, develop and commercialize KPL-404 under the BIDMC license agreement (the “BIDMC Agreement”). Under the BIDMC Agreement, we are solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. We are also responsible for costs related to filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patent rights. Under the BIDMC Agreement, we are obligated to pay an insignificant annual maintenance fee as well as future clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $1.2 million to BIDMC. We are also obligated to pay a low single-digit royalty on annual net sales of products licensed under the agreement, if approved.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate any late-stage manufacturing facilities. Although we have built a development and manufacturing facility to produce drug substance to support certain research, preclinical and other clinical development for our product candidates, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our late-stage product candidates and certain of our early-stage product candidates for the majority of our clinical development efforts, as well as for the commercial manufacture of ARCALYST and our future products and product candidates, if approved. We have entered into a Supply Agreement with Regeneron pursuant to which Regeneron has the exclusive right to manufacture and supply all of our requirements of ARCALYST for development and commercial activities. The Supply Agreement terminates upon the termination of the Regeneron Agreement or the date of completion of the transfer of technology related to the manufacture of ARCALYST. Regeneron, in turn, relies 

20



upon a third-party CMO to conduct fill/finish operations for ARCALYST. Under certain circumstances, we or Regeneron could initiate a technology transfer to either us or another CMO to manufacture ARCALYST. For example, Regeneron could unilaterally initiate a technology transfer to us as early as March 2023.
We also have engaged CMOs to produce mavrilimumab drug substance and drug product and have qualified CMOs to produce KPL-404 drug product. We currently remain the sole producer of KPL-404 drug substance. We intend to use CMOs for development and scale-up work for any future clinical trials and eventual commercialization of mavrilimumab and KPL-404, if approved. 
We require our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice or similar foreign requirements (“cGMP”). We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight of our CMOs. We currently perform most process development internally but are reliant on CMOs for late-stage clinical manufacturing, process qualification and validation and commercial supply. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any of these CMOs to cover commercial production. We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of drug substance and finished drug product in the future.
Our reliance on third-parties to manufacture certain of our products and product candidates exposes us to risks, and any technology transfer of our products or product candidates may be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties.”
Commercial Operations
Our commercial team combines dozens of years of pharmaceutical commercial leadership experience with a passion for helping patients with significant unmet need. Since March 2021, we have marketed ARCALYST, our only commercial product, in the United States for recurrent pericarditis, a debilitating disease, and have established our own specialty salesforce to expand our commercialization efforts nationwide. Our salesforce is complemented by our current medical affairs, payor and patient services teams. We have also built an efficient digital marketing effort by targeting prescribers currently treating recurrent pericarditis. 
We intend to expand our capabilities in parallel with the development path of our product candidates. For each product candidate, we intend to establish commercialization strategies as we approach potential marketing approval and, due to the specialization among physicians treating the indications we are targeting, we expect to be able leverage our then-existing medical affairs, payor and patient services teams, and marketing organization. 
Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our products and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, including ARCALYST, KPL-404 and mavrilimumab, may compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of ARCALYST, KPL-404 and mavrilimumab and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be our product candidates, including their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Competition, Executing our Strategy and Managing Growth—We face 

21



substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than we do.”
We are aware of the following products currently marketed or in clinical development for the treatment of the diseases that we are initially targeting:
ARCALYST
Recurrent Pericarditis: We are not aware of any FDA-approved therapies for recurrent pericarditis, but we are aware of two programs being developed in this indication. One is by R-Pharm International (RPH-104), which inhibits IL-1α/IL-1β-induced signaling and is in Phase 2 development; the other is an oral cannabidiol being developed by Cardiol Therapeutics in an open label Phase 2 setting. 
Dual IL-1α and IL-1β Inhibition: Anakinra (KINERET), marketed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, is currently approved for use in RA, CAPS and DIRA. We are not aware of any active, industry sponsored development programs using anakinra seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis.
IL-1β Inhibition Alone: Canakinumab (ILARIS), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, is currently approved for use in CAPS, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS), Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), Still’s Disease and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). We are not aware of any active, industry sponsored development programs using canakinumab seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis. Additionally, Novartis is also developing gevokizumab for use in oncologic indications. In addition, there are several molecules in development designed to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular sensor of a broad range of danger signals, that leads to the release of IL-1β and IL-18. Clinical stage development programs include: VTX2735 and VTX3232 (Ventyx Biosciences, Inc.), ZYIL-1 (Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.), HT-6184 (Halia Therapeutics, Inc.), OLT1177 (Olatec Therapeutics LLC), DFV-890 (Novartis A.G.), Selnoflast (Roche), NT-0167 and NT-0796 (NodThera Ltd.), Somalix and Onzomelid (Roche).
IL-1α Inhibition Alone: There are other therapies which modulate IL-1α in preclinical and clinical development for diseases other than recurrent pericarditis from Johnson & Johnson and XBIOTECH USA, INC. We are not aware of any active, industry sponsored development programs for these programs seeking a label for recurrent pericarditis.
KPL-404
There are various programs in clinical development antagonizing the CD40 / CD154 costimulatory pathway, however we believe the high concentration liquid formulation of KPL-404 enables chronic subcutaneous dosing, which could be a key differentiator. 
​
Subcutaneous Administration: Novartis A.G. is developing CFZ-533, or iscalimab (anti-CD40) for subcutaneous administration for the treatment of Sjögren's Syndrome.
​
Intravenous Administration Only: Horizon Therapeutics plc (in the process of being acquired by Amgen Inc.) is developing the Tn3 fusion protein, dazodalibep (anti-CD40L); Biogen, Inc. and UCB S.A. are developing dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) for the treatment of moderately to severely active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; and Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing AT-1501 (anti-CD40L) for use by patients undergoing kidney transplantation.
​
Potential Subcutaneous Administration: Certain other programs present the potential for subcutaneous administration. Sanofi S.A./ImmuNext Inc. are developing SAR441344 (anti-CD40L) for the treatment of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Bristol Myers-Squibb is developing BMS-986325 (anti-CD40) for the treatment of Primary Sjögren's Syndrome; and H. Lundbeck A/S is developing Lu AG22515 (bi-specific, anti-CD40L & Albumin (scFv)2-Fab).

22



Mavrilimumab
GM-CSF Antagonists: There are programs in clinical development in various indications that modulate GM-CSF signaling from I-MAB Biopharma (plonmarlimab), Roivant Sciences Ltd. (gimsilumab and namilumab) and Humanigen, Inc. (lenzilumab). All of these competitive programs target the GM-CSF ligand itself versus targeting the GM-CSF receptor like mavrilimumab.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We plan to protect our proprietary position using a variety of methods, which include pursuing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, including compositions of matter, drug product formulations, methods of use and methods of manufacture, that are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we or our licensors have or are pursuing patents covering the composition of matter for each of our product candidates and we generally pursue patent protection covering methods of use for each clinical program. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
​
ARCALYST
​
We have a field-specific exclusive license under the Regeneron Agreement to granted patents and pending applications in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions relating to ARCALYST. As of December 31, 2022, the patent rights in-licensed under the Regeneron Agreement relating to our program include two granted patents in the United States and 25 patents granted in other jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In addition, the patent rights in-licensed under the Regeneron Agreement relating to our program include patent applications that are pending in the United States, Canada, Europe and selected countries in Asia. A U.S. patent covering ARCALYST as a composition of matter expired in 2020, and relevant composition of matter patents issued outside of the United States are expected to expire in 2023, not including any patent term extensions. Two patents covering methods of using ARCALYST in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis have issued in the U.S. and have a statutory term that expires in 2038, not including any patent term adjustment. In March 2021, the FDA granted approval for ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years of age and older, which granted us seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States. See “—License agreement with Regeneron” above for additional information on our rights under the Regeneron Agreement.
​
KPL-404
​
We own, via our acquisition of Primatope, granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions relating to KPL-404.

Mavrilimumab
​
We have an exclusive license under the MedImmune Agreement to granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions relating to mavrilimumab. These patents and patent applications cover mavrilimumab as a composition of matter and its use. As of December 31, 2022, the patent rights in-licensed under the MedImmune Agreement relating to our program include three granted patents in the United States and 109 patents granted in other jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In addition, the patent rights in licensed under the MedImmune Agreement relating to our program include patent applications that are pending in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, and selected countries in Asia and Latin America. The composition of matter patents for mavrilimumab generally have statutory expiration dates in 2027, although the term of some U.S. patents may be longer due to patent term adjustment to compensate for delays during the patent prosecution process. Patent term extension could extend the expiration date of one patent in the United States and patents in certain other jurisdictions, each in accordance with applicable law. See “—License agreement with MedImmune” above for additional information on our rights under the MedImmune Agreement.
​
There can be no assurances that patents will issue from any pending patent applications or that any existing patents may be extended. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, or if the terms of our patents are insufficient to protect our product candidates for an adequate amount of time, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be materially impaired.”
​
In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions (as applicable, “regulatory authorities”), provided the legal requirements are met, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
​
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Government Regulation of Biological Products
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | Completion of extensive preclinical studies and tests in accordance with applicable regulations, including Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




● | Submission to FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approval by an independent institutional review board (an “IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of preclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A determination by FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and CMC Evaluations
Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of the chemistry, formulation and stability of the product candidate, as well as trials to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with chemistry manufacturing and controls (“CMC”), information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to CMC issues, preclinical issues, or one or more issues in the proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not necessarily result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA also may place the IND on partial clinical hold, and a proposed study may only be partially executable, including due to FDA restrictions.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or participants under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each 

25



clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, commonly known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to participants. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy participants with the target disease or condition who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in participants with the target disease or condition to determine the optimal dose and dosing schedule. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of participants at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of participants in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

26



BLA Review and Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must contain substantial evidence supporting the safety, purity, potency (or efficacy) of the product candidate and may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product candidate’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency (or efficacy) of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews all BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an BLA for filing. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the 60-day filing date for an application with priority review. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic candidates which present challenges in interpretation of the safety or efficacy data to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric population for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a 

27



marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (a “iPSP”) within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial iPSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the iPSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial iPSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical or other data, additional clinical trial(s) or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the re-submitted BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the label. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs, or new safety findings after market introduction. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. 
However, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.

28



A designated Orphan Drug may not receive Orphan Drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any BLA submitted to the FDA for approval, including a BLA for a product candidate with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review original BLAs with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months under its standard review goals.
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug and biologics intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. A product that receives accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails conduct the required confirmatory trials in a timely manner or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be 

29



shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Post-approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall.
Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30




● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biosimilars and Exclusivity
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the “BPCIA”) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “ACA”). 
Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. 
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Foreign Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, post-marketing requirements and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates.
As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained whether or not product candidates obtain FDA approval for a pharmaceutical product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can start clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Regulatory Framework in the European Union
Non-Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
​
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union (the “EU”) are subject to significant regulatory controls.
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (the “ICH”) guidelines on GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (the “CTR”) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (a “CTA”) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. One of the main aims of EU CTR is to increase transparency about clinical trials, which is done by making documents and data from the CTA publicly available through CTIS at time of decision about the clinical trial. There are few exceptions to this, and release of personal data and company confidential information is controlled through redaction and through requesting a trial-phase dependent deferral of disclosure.
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the Clinical Trials Directive, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of the Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials (including those which are ongoing) will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.

Marketing Authorization
​
In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (an “MA”). To obtain a MA of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit a MA application (an “MAA”). The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:

● | “Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”) of the EMA, and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicines, such as (i) medicines derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) products designated as orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered products) and (iv) products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases or autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.

● | “National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, in order to grant the MA, the competent authorities of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
Under the centralized procedure and in exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) scheme, a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.

33



Moreover, in the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions. Once the pending studies are provided, it can become a “standard” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved to medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
​
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. New products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon receiving MA. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
Orphan Medicinal Products
​
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The application for Orphan Drug designation must be submitted before the application for MA. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a MA, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, the competent authorities cannot accept another MAA, or grant an MA, or accept an application to extend a MA for a similar product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by 

34



two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (a “PIP”). No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Pediatrics Development
​
In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a PIP agreed with the EMA's Pediatric Committee (the “PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.
Post-approval Requirements
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU member states. The holder of MA for a medicinal product must also comply with pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance (a “QPPV”) who is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of that system and oversees the safety profiles of medicinal products and any emerging safety concerns. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The RMP must be updated any time new information on the medicinal product becomes available which has a significant impact on the content of the RMP. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
In addition, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.

35



Failure to comply with EU and national laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) (comprised of the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
Since the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1, 2021, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) has not been directly subject to EU laws, however under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, EU laws generally apply to Northern Ireland. The EU laws that have been transposed into United Kingdom (the “UK”) law through secondary legislation remain applicable in Great Britain. However, under the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022, which is currently before the UK parliament, any retained EU law not expressly preserved and “assimilated” into domestic law or extended by ministerial regulations (to no later than June 23, 2026) will automatically expire and be revoked by December 31, 2023. New legislation such as the EU CTR or in relation to orphan medicines will not be applicable to Great Britain. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. Whilst Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. 
The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore after Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAs. In order to obtain a UK MA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be established in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new (centralized procedure) MA when determining an application for a GB authorization (the so-called “EC Decision Reliance Procedure”); or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in GB (the so-called “MRDC Reliance Procedure”).
There will be no pre-MA orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB, rather than the EU, must not be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period or market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, or Japan, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and 

36



reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare Laws 
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other U.S., federal, state and foreign healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals. Similar laws exists in foreign jurisdictions, including the EU, as well. 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, or to self-pay patients.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several biopharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off-label), and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that 

37



apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year and the reported information is publicly made available on a searchable website. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Moreover, analogous state and foreign laws and regulations may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. These laws and regulations may differ from one another in significant ways, thus further complicating compliance efforts. For instance, in the EU, many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medicinal products, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on pharmaceutical companies. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.
Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, individual imprisonment of executive officers and employees of such companies, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional 

38



reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. The United States government, state legislatures and governments outside the United States have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded drug and biologic products. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or a substantial part of the associated healthcare costs. Providers and patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a substantial portion of the cost of our products. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. If approved, sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage and the related coverage criteria for a biological product typically is separate from, but related to, the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the level of reimbursement that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. With respect to biologics, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels, which results in higher cost-sharing financial obligation imposed on patients. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates, or to impose coverage criteria the limiting situations in which our product candidates are covered, could reduce physician utilization of a product. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage, coverage criteria, and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific, clinical and health economic support for the use of their products to each payor separately, which is a time-consuming process.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. The increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-benefit of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third-party payors do not consider a product to offer a favorable cost-benefit compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit.
In addition, in many countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the EU, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Member states are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate 

39



positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Member states may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Government Price Reporting
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”), as a condition of federal funds being made available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and for certain drugs or biologicals under Medicare Part B, we pay a rebate to state Medicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and paid for by the state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare programs. For the MDRP, these data include the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for each drug and, in the case of innovator products, best price. If we become aware that our MDRP price reporting submission for a prior period was incorrect or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the revised data for up to three years after those data originally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions, including termination from the MDRP, in which case payment would not be available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid or, if applicable, Medicare Part B.
Federal law requires that a manufacturer that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program (the “340B program”) in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) and requires us, as a participating manufacturer, to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs when used in an outpatient setting. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. A drug that is designated for a rare disease or condition by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not subject to the 340B ceiling price requirement with regard to the following types of covered entities: rural referral centers, sole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and free-standing cancer hospitals. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA publishes them to 340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities for 340B-eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through which 340B covered entities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges, and through which manufacturers may pursue claims against 340B covered entities for engaging in unlawful diversion or duplicate discounting of 340B drugs. 
In order to be eligible to have drug products paid for with federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we must also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. Under the VA/FSS program, we must report the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no more than the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula.

These four agencies are the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service). We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If we fail to provide timely information or are found to have knowingly submitted false information, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties.
Individual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are considering implementation of drug price transparency legislation. Requirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states may impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers who fail to comply with drug price transparency requirements.
Healthcare Reform and Potential Changes to Healthcare Laws 
The FDAs and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDAs user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended manufacturer Medicaid rebate obligations to utilization by individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. More recently, in March 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which eliminates the statutory cap on the Medicaid drug rebate, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers and will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by Congress; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment 

41



centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years; and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP, beginning January 1, 2024.
More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, and the impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug and biologic pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs and biologics under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
On December 13, 2021, the EU adopted Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (the “HTA”). While the HTA entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from January 2025 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once the HTA becomes applicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products. The HTA intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The HTA will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governments and third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services.
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In 

42



addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Human Capital
​
We aim to cultivate a highly-skilled and passionate team determined to strive to deliver transformative therapies to the patients who need them most. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 220 full-time employees, of which approximately 210 were located within the United States and approximately 10 were located outside of the United States. 
​
We believe that the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel at all levels of our company. To do that, we employ a number of measures, including competitive compensation and benefits, fostering a culture that values diversity and inclusion, maintaining an ethical workplace and focusing on employee safety and wellness. These measures help form our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following actions, programs and initiatives:
​
Competitive Pay and Benefits. We provide our employees with competitive fixed salaries, cash bonus opportunities designed to incentivize achievement of our goals and individual objectives, equity awards and opportunities for equity ownership through our employee share purchase plan as well as a robust benefit package designed to promote well-being across different aspects of our employees’ lives, including comprehensive health insurance, dental and vision plans, life and other employment related insurance, retirement planning through a 401(k) plan with partial company match, and paid time off.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We value diversity and inclusion at all levels of our company. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives that a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having an inclusive culture. In 2021, we launched our diversity statement as a way to formally express our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) goals and initiated a monthly DEI dashboard for our employees. This initiative is part of our broader effort to establish a systematic approach towards DEI. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines our aim of cultivating a diverse and inclusive work environment. We mandate that our employees train annually on non-discrimination, antiracism, and promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace. As an additional demonstration of our focus on DEI, we signed the MassBio’s CEO Pledge for a More Equitable and Inclusive Life Sciences Industry to recognize racial inequity in our industry and to work towards a more equitable and inclusive life sciences industry.
​
Ethics in the Workplace. We aim to run a compliant and ethical business, which we believe attracts and maintains the highest caliber of executives and employees. Each employee of our company is required to confirm in writing that they understand and will comply with our policies, including but not limited to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our insider trading and compliance policy, our policies against bribery and corruption and our policies regarding interactions with healthcare professionals. Employees are required to participate in periodic and as-needed trainings in order to refresh their understanding of our policies and provide additional instruction for new issues as and when they arise. For the clinical and manufacturing activities that we perform and oversee, we adhere to operating within the accepted GCP, cGMP and other similar regulatory guidelines. Overall, we believe that our commitment to quality and ethics throughout our business makes us a stronger, compliant and competitive organization.
​
Health and Safety. Health and safety principles are firmly rooted across our company through the integration of health and safety processes throughout our business and risk management. To foster a safe and healthy culture, we have implemented a comprehensive safety program and emergency response plan, driving to understand and mitigate against health and safety incidents. As part of our employee health and safety program, we have a number of safety policies that employees are required to train on, conduct periodic on-site safety drills at our offices and perform periodic internal and external safety audits.
​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and measures introduced by state and federal governments in the United States, we have implemented COVID-19-specific workplace safety protocols at our facilities. We currently 

43



require all employees entering our workplaces in the United States to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, subject to a reasonable accommodation process. We have also established additional safety measures at our facilities, including providing personal protective equipment and recommending that employees stay home while feeling unwell. We continue to monitor the developments, restrictions and requirements in jurisdictions where we have offices, and plan to update the protocols for our offices, as applicable.
