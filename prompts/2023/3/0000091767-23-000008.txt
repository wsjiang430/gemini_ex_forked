Item 1. Business
(a) General Development of Business –
Sonoco Products Company ("Sonoco," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a South Carolina corporation founded in Hartsville, South Carolina, in 1899 as the Southern Novelty Company. At its beginnings in 1899, a team of 12 people worked from a rented warehouse to produce the Company’s first product, a cone-shaped paper yarn carrier used for winding and transporting yarn. Since most of the textile cones of that day were wooden, paper cones were a novelty. The Company soon became the leading producer of cones in the United States. The Southern Novelty Company continued to diversify its product line and add new operations around the country. In 1923, the Southern Novelty Company name was changed to Sonoco Products Company, or "Sonoco," using the first two letters from each word of its original name.
Sonoco is now a multi-billion dollar global designer, developer, and manufacturer of a variety of highly-engineered and sustainable packaging serving multiple end markets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 310 locations in 32 countries, serving some of the world’s best-known brands in some 85 nations. Sonoco is committed to creating sustainable products, services and programs for our customers, employees and communities that support our corporate purpose: Better Packaging. Better Life. Our goal is to bring more to packaging than just the package by offering integrated packaging solutions that help define brand personalities, create unique customer experiences, and enhance the quality of products. We seek to help our customers solve their packaging challenges by connecting insights to innovation and developing customized solutions that are tailored to the customer’s goals and objectives.
(c) Description of Business –
Segment Reporting
The Company currently reports its financial results in two reportable segments – Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with all remaining businesses reported as All Other. Further information about the Company’s reportable segments is provided in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Consumer Packaging
The Consumer Packaging segment accounted for approximately 52%, 42% and 43% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The operations in this segment consisted of 87 plants throughout the world as of December 31, 2022. Products within the Consumer Packaging segment consist of rigid packaging (paper, metal, and plastic) and flexible packaging, primarily serving the consumer staples market focused on food, beverage, household, and personal products.
Our rigid paper containers are manufactured from 100% recycled paperboard provided primarily from Sonoco global paper operations. These paper products are primarily used in the food and beverage markets including snacks, baked goods, powdered drinks, and confectionary goods. With the Ball Metalpack acquisition in 2022, we expanded our manufacturing capability in steel and aluminum metal fabrication beyond our existing metal ends and closures products to include metal packaging products for food and household products including vegetables, tomatoes, fruit, spray cleaners, paint, and other products. Our rigid plastic products are comprised of thermoformed plastic trays and enclosures for fresh produce, condiments, and pre-packaged foods. Our flexible packaging is comprised primarily of plastic packaging serving a variety of food and personal product applications where high-barrier properties are critical for freshness and shelf-life.
Within the Consumer Packaging segment, Sonoco’s rigid paper containers are the Company’s largest revenue-producing group of products and services, representing approximately 21% of consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022. This group comprised 24% and 25% of consolidated net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Industrial Paper Packaging
The Industrial Paper Packaging segment accounted for approximately 37%, 44% and 38% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This segment served its markets through 182 plants on five continents as of December 31, 2022. Sonoco’s paper operations provide the primary raw material for the Company’s fiber-based packaging. Sonoco uses approximately 49% of the paper it manufactures, and the remainder is sold to third parties. This vertical integration strategy was supported by 23 paper mills with 29 paper machines throughout the world as of December 31, 2022.The Company also operates 23 recycling facilities in the United States capable of recycling old corrugated containers, paper, plastics, metals, and other recyclable materials that can be processed back through the Sonoco manufacturing ecosystem. In 2022, Sonoco had the capacity to manufacture approximately 2.2 million tons of recycled paperboard per year. Products within the Industrial Paper Packaging segment consist primarily of goods produced from recycled fiber including paperboard tubes, cores, and cones, paper-based protective materials and uncoated recycled paperboard for high-end applications such as folding cartons, can board, and laminated structures.
Products across this segment support multiple end markets in industrials (construction and building products, and industrial distribution), consumer staples (food and beverage, food distribution, household and personal products), and consumer discretionary (home building, appliances, apparel, and home furnishings), as well as various other end markets.
In 2022, Sonoco’s tubes and cores products were the Company’s second largest revenue-producing group of products, representing approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022. This group comprised 21% and 19% of consolidated net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
All Other
The businesses grouped as All Other accounted for approximately 11%, 14%, and 19% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The operations in this segment consisted of 39 plants throughout the world as of December 31, 2022. Products within the All Other businesses consist of a variety of packaging materials including plastic, paper, foam, and various other specialty materials. All Other businesses serve a wide variety of end markets including consumer staples, consumer discretionary, industrial, and pharmaceuticals. Prior to their divestitures in 2020 and 2021, the Company's global display and packaging businesses, which included point-of-purchase displays, fulfillment operations, and contract packaging, were reported in All Other.

Other Aspects of the Company's Business
Product Distribution – Each of the Company’s operating units has its own sales staff and maintains direct sales relationships with its customers. Some of the units have service staff at the manufacturing facility that interact directly with customers. The Industrial Paper Packaging segment and certain operations within the Consumer Packaging segment have customer service centers located in Hartsville, South Carolina, which are the main contact points between their North American business units and their customers. Divisional sales personnel also provide sales management, marketing, and product development assistance as needed. Typically, product distribution is directly from the manufacturing plant to the customer but, in some cases, product is warehoused in a mutually advantageous location to be shipped to the customer as needed.
Raw Materials – The principal raw materials used by the Company are recovered paper, paperboard, steel, aluminum, and plastic resins. Raw materials are purchased from a number of outside sources. After a number of global supply chain challenges in the past several years, the Company considers the supply and availability of raw materials to be adequate to meet its needs.
Patents, Trademarks, and Related Contracts – Most inventions and product and process innovations are generated by Sonoco’s development, marketing and engineering staff, and are important to the Company’s internal growth. Patents have been granted on many inventions created by Sonoco staff in the United States and in many other countries. Patents, trademarks and proprietary technology are also acquired through acquisitions. During 2022, proprietary technology was acquired as part of the Ball Metalpack (renamed Sonoco Metal Packaging) acquisition and both proprietary technology and trademarks were acquired as part of the Skjern acquisition. Patents are managed globally by a Sonoco intellectual capital management team through the Company’s subsidiary Sonoco Development, Inc. ("SDI"). SDI globally manages patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and license agreements. Some patents have been licensed to other manufacturers, and Sonoco also licenses a few patents from outside companies and universities. U.S. patents expire after about 20 years, and patents on new innovations replace many of the abandoned or expired patents. A second intellectual capital subsidiary of Sonoco, SPC Resources, Inc., globally manages Sonoco’s trademarks, service marks, copyrights and Internet domain names. Most of Sonoco’s products are marketed worldwide under trademarks such as Sonoco®, SmartSeal®, Sonotube®, Sealclick®, Sonopost® and UltraSeal®. Sonoco’s registered web domain names provide information about Sonoco, its people and its products. Trademarks and domain names are licensed to outside companies where appropriate.
Seasonality – Although demand for the majority of the Company's products is not seasonal to any significant degree, the Company's Metal Packaging operations (acquired in January 2022) generally experience higher sales and operating profits during the second and third quarters of the year as demand for certain of its products increases during the peak of the food packaging season. 
Dependence on Customers – On an aggregate basis during 2022, the five largest customers in the Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging segments accounted for approximately 26% and 12%, respectively, of each segment’s net sales. The five largest customers in the All Other group of businesses accounted for approximately 14% of the group’s net sales.
None of the Company’s customers represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues in 2022 or consolidated trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.
Additional information regarding Sonoco's customers is provided in Item 1A - Risk Factors under the caption "Risks Related to Competition, Customers and Suppliers."
Backlog - The Company provides a wide variety of products to multiple end markets and relies on its customers' forecasts to position raw materials for manufacturing within its facilities. The Company does not carry a significant backlog and, in general, aligns its customer deliveries on a build-to-order basis.
Competition – The Company sells its products in highly competitive markets, which include paper, textile, film, food, packaging, construction, and wire and cable. All of these markets are influenced by the overall rate of economic activity, and their behavior is principally driven by supply and demand. Because we operate in highly competitive markets, we regularly bid for new and continuing business. Losses or awards of business from our largest customers, customer changes to alternative forms of packaging, and the repricing of business can have a significant effect on our operating results. The Company manufactures and sells many of its products globally. The Company, having operated internationally since 1923, considers its ability to serve its customers worldwide in a timely and consistent manner a competitive advantage. The Company also believes that its technological leadership, reputation for quality, and vertical integration are competitive advantages. Expansion of the Company’s product lines and global presence is driven by the rapidly changing needs of its major customers, who demand high-quality, state-of-the-art, environmentally compatible packaging, wherever they choose to do business. It is important to be a low-cost producer in order to compete effectively. The Company is focused on productivity improvements and other cost-reduction initiatives utilizing the latest in technology. Additional information regarding competition is provided in Item 1A - Risk Factors under the caption "Risks Related to Competition, Customers and Suppliers."
Compliance with Government Regulations and Laws – The Company must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries where it conducts business with respect to a variety of matters. Information regarding compliance with government regulations, including environmental laws, is provided in Item 1A - Risk Factors, in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption “Risk Management,” and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Culture – At Sonoco, our purpose is ingrained in our culture. In fact, it drives our culture. It drives our product development. It drives how we work with our customers and each other. It drives what we do, and the decisions we make. Our purpose isn’t just a collection of words. It represents the collective spirit of an organization focused on one thing: Better Packaging. Better Life.
Sustainability - Packaging plays a fundamental role in providing safe and hygienic delivery systems for food, medicines and other essential products around the world. However, we believe the importance of packaging extends beyond its functionality to also include its impact on the planet. During 2020, we established a new corporate team, led by a vice president directly reporting to our CEO, to champion our global sustainability efforts. This team has expanded and leads the Company’s global sustainability programs for all our Consumer- and Industrial-related packaging businesses, including driving efforts to meet our climate change related goals. 
In partnership with our employees, we are committed to protecting the natural environment and our communities through sustainable practices. We emphasize a culture of accountability and strive to conduct our business in a manner that is fair, ethical, and responsible to earn the trust of our employees. Additionally, we continue to convene our Corporate Sustainability Council to provide oversight, guidance, and direction on social, community, and environmental issues that impact the reputation and economic performance of the Company and to help address the concerns of our stakeholders. The Council meets quarterly and reports to and is sponsored by Sonoco’s President and CEO. The Council reports on Sonoco’s sustainability activities, quarterly, to the Board of Directors. We have committed to reporting in line with the Global Reporting Initiative standards.
Our sustainability goals include the following key elements:
5 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 


Greenhouse Gas Emissions - While we estimate that we have reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions intensity by approximately 25% since 2009, we are committed to further improving our environmental impact by setting ambitious new targets to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, which is aimed at limiting the warming of global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Specifically, Sonoco aims to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from a 2020 base year. We have also set a goal to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 13.5% by 2030 from a 2019 base year by working with our customers and suppliers to develop innovative packaging solutions that reduce packaging waste and improve recyclability. These goals were validated by the Science-Based Target initiative in June 2021. In addition, we are actively studying necessary operational changes, technology developments and market changes that would be required to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.
Energy Usage - We strive to manage, mitigate and reduce our GHG emissions where possible. In support of our GHG emission reductions, Sonoco aims to continue energy efficiency improvements in our manufacturing plants targeted to reduce total energy use by at least 8% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline in addition to investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and alternative power projects. 
Water Usage - Reducing our water consumption is part of being responsible stewards of our planet’s resources. Many of our actions to reduce water usage involve our global paper mills, which account for the majority of our global water usage. We have conducted initial water risk studies at these manufacturing facilities using the WRI Aqueduct water risk tool.
Single Use Plastics - We are committed to reducing the use and impact of virgin plastics on the environment. As such, we are working to ensure we can make relevant on-pack recyclability claims for at least 75% of our global rigid plastic product portfolio, while also ensuring we are closing the loop through continued use of post-consumer recycled content. We are also committed to responsibly managing resins use at our facilities and are implementing "Operation Clean Sweep", a program focused on preventing discharge of plastic pellets and nurdles into the environment. 
Recycling - We also serve as a valued partner to our customers to reduce the environmental impact of their packaging. We continue to develop a range of products made from renewable materials and materials that can be recycled or composted at the end of their life. 
We engage in activities and make investments that we believe will enable us to innovate our products and improve our operational infrastructure as well as drive end-of-life solutions for our products and develop partnerships with key stakeholders across our value chain to help deliver sustainable solutions.
People Management - Sonoco’s core belief in “People and Packaging with a Purpose” underlies our efforts to attract, acquire and retain talented employees for our global businesses. We bring more to packaging than just the package. 
We depend on our employees to achieve our mission of creating sustainable packaging solutions that help build our customers’ brands, enhance the quality of their products and improve the quality of life for people around the world. We work towards this goal by establishing a foundation for actions that support sustainability; health and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; and talent development. Integrity is a hallmark of the Sonoco culture.
We seek to engage, develop and reward our employee base so they can successfully pursue our purpose of Better Packaging. Better Life. The Company believes that a strong focus on human capital through the talent we hire and retain is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. This focus on human capital is reinforced by our Policies on Business Conduct and through increasing employee awareness and education, communication and training.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 22,000 full-time equivalent employees, with the majority concentrated in the United States. We consider our employee relations to be strong.
People Objectives
We rely on the personal relationships and service provided by employees. As such, we believe attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent is vital to our success. The Company is focused on supporting our employees, and we consider the management of our talent to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. Our Board of Directors, and the Executive Compensation and Employee & Public Responsibility Committees of the Board, provide oversight of our human capital management strategy.
Health and Safety 
We take the health and safety of our employees seriously. Protecting the health and safety of our employees is a top priority, and we are committed to providing a safe working environment for all our associates. We expect each employee to follow our safety standards and protocols. 
We use global and local incident data along with identifying leading indicators to create program and safety improvement action plans to reduce conditions and behaviors that lead to at-risk situations. Sonoco tracks safety performance and training indicators with a goal of reducing safety incidents and improving upon the previous year’s performance. Overall injuries in 2022 were slightly up from 2021, but remained lower than 2020 and 2019, despite the effects of acquisitions. To promote the prevention of more significant injuries or incidents that cause or have the potential to cause permanent disabilities or the loss of life, we continue to engage with outside experts to conduct assessments of high-risk activities and to leverage learnings from such engagement globally. In addition, we evaluated our safety systems to improve focus and resources. Globally, we achieved completion of 99% of all safety improvement action plans, which are site level improvement plans designed to reduce risk, in 2022. Finally, our operations leadership implemented a new safety playbook globally in 2022 to further train our employees. We believe tracking and reporting of Sonoco’s health and safety data increases accountability and provides important insights into processes that need improvement or enhancement. 
Other employee well-being resources include wellness courses and a variety of online training classes, as well as other programs to promote mental and physical health. We continue to utilize employee feedback and surveys to gather information to better serve our team members. Members of our human resources department annually review benefits to ensure we can support the well-being of our employees and their families. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") starts with our goal of developing a workforce that is diverse in background, knowledge, skill and experience. Sonoco engages in efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBT+ individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. We have implemented policies and training focused on non-discrimination and harassment prevention. We embrace DEI, which we believe fosters leadership through new ideas and perspectives. In 2022, we continued the evolution of our DEI strategy and objectives, an ongoing business imperative. In connection with its diversity initiatives, Sonoco periodically requests that its employees and Board members self-identify based on specified diversity categories. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 25.5% of our total work force and 17.0% of our senior leaders identified as female, while approximately 33.2% of our U.S. workforce and 13.6% of our senior leaders identified as a member of an underrepresented ethnic group. From our global workforce, our employees were located in the following geographic regions: 57% in North America; 18% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; 15% in Latin America; and 10% in Asia Pacific. 
We have labor unions in all regions of our operations, and in North America, approximately 12.5% of our employees are represented by unions. We rely on the unique qualities and talents of our employees to help us meet our strategic priorities. Our DEI goals are focused on increasing the representation of women and racial minorities into more salaried and senior leadership positions. We are working toward this goal by increasing hiring, focusing on development and promotions, as well as focusing on retention efforts. We made significant progress in talent acquisition during 2022, despite a challenging labor market. In the U.S., 29% of new employee hires were female and 42% a member of a minority group in 2022. 
6 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 


For the past 11 years, Sonoco’s employees have expanded and improved our Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (the "DEI Council"), which is chaired by our President and CEO. In 2022, the Company changed the name of the DEI Council, which was formerly known as the Global Diversity and Inclusion Council, to reflect the Company's increasing emphasis on driving equity as part of an inclusive employee environment. An important part of our DEI efforts includes Sonoco’s Business Resource Groups, which are groups of employees who support our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. In 2022, we continued to focus DEI Council activities on workforce representation (diversity and equity) and work environment (equity and inclusion) by addressing unconscious bias to promote an environment where diverse backgrounds are appreciated, and diverse ideas are heard. In 2022, the DEI Council hosted a global Diversity & Inclusion Leadership Summit at headquarters in Hartsville, South Carolina, with a primary focus of equipping global DEI leaders with tools and information to increase impact in their regions. 
We have continued to build our Supplier Diversity Program since 2004, integrating diversity and inclusion into our procurement process by laying a strong foundation with key internal and external stakeholders. We developed policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal opportunity and enable access. As part of Sonoco’s Supplier Diversity Program, supplier diversity progress is reported to the CEO, who in turn reports the progress to the Employee & Public Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors.
Talent Development
Attracting, developing and retaining talented employees is critical to our success and is an integral part of our human capital strategy. We have created a Global Talent Acquisition and Organization Development team to provide a more holistic approach to managing and enriching the employee lifecycle through continuous training and comprehensive succession planning. In 2021 and 2022, we significantly expanded Sonoco University, our internal learning resource that offers on-demand webinars, e-learning and in-person learning programs. Sonoco also provides employees access to self-directed e-learning courses taught by industry experts with curated learning paths designed for specific professional interests. In addition, we conduct regular talent succession assessments along with individual performance reviews in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual development plans to assist with individual career development.
We are also committed to pay equity and regularly review our compensation model to promote more fair and inclusive pay practices across our business. We offer competitive benefits packages that reflect the needs of our workforce. In the United States, we provide medical, dental, and vision benefits, life and disability coverage, education reimbursement, and paid time off. We provide retirement benefits including a 401(k)-match program. Our executive compensation program is designed to align incentives with achievement of the Company’s strategic plan and both short- and long-term operating objectives.
