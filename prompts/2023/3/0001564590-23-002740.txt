 GENERAL
 We design and market Skechers-branded lifestyle footwear for men, women and children, performance footwear for men and women under the Skechers Performance brand name, and work footwear for men and women under Skechers Work brand name. We design and market Skechers branded lifestyle apparel and license the Skechers brand to others for accessories, pet accessories, leather goods, eyewear and medical scrubs, among other categories. Skechers footwear reflects a combination of style, quality, comfort, innovation and value that appeals to a broad range of consumers. Our product offering is sold through wholesale distribution to department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers, and e-commerce retailers, and directly to consumers through Skechers brick and mortar and digital stores. Our objective is to profitably grow our operations worldwide while leveraging our recognizable Skechers brand through our diversified product lines, innovative advertising and various distribution channels.
 We believe that brand recognition is an important element for success in the footwear business. We aggressively market our brands through comprehensive marketing campaigns for men, women and children. The Skechers brand is supported by print, television, digital, radio, outdoor and press campaigns as well as donation events for BOBS from Skechers. To further drive recognition, we enlist numerous celebrities, former and current athletes, and influencers to appear in our campaigns. In 2022, our brand ambassadors included television personalities and entertainers Martha Stewart, Amanda Kloots, Brooke Burke, Willie Nelson and Chesca, athlete Clayton Kershaw, and former athletes Sugar Ray Leonard, Tony Romo, Howie Long, Cris Carter, Meb Keflezighi, and Rusty Wallace. More recently, culture and entertainment icon Snoop Dogg joined our stable of brand ambassadors. Additionally, athletes supporting our performance footwear included runner Edward Cheserek, elite golfers Matt Fitzpatrick, Brooke Henderson and Colin Montgomerie, and pro pickleball players Tyson McGuffin and Catherine Parenteau.
 Since 1992, when we introduced our first line, Skechers USA Sport Utility Footwear, we have expanded our product offering and grown our sales while substantially increasing the breadth and penetration of our account and customer base. Our men’s, women’s and children’s product lines benefit from the Skechers reputation for style, quality, comfort, and innovation all at a reasonable price. Our Performance lines benefit from our marketing, product development, technology, wins on the course or track, and feedback from athletes and wear testers.

 Skechers Apparel. Skechers designs and markets a collection of lifestyle apparel for men, women and kids. The collection features Skechers characteristics that consumers around the world have come to expect from the brand. The activewear garments are designed to directly coordinate with the brand’s footwear products. The Skechers apparel collection is sold at Skechers retail stores, on our websites and through wholesale customers.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
 Our principal goal in product design is to develop innovative, comfortable, stylish, quality footwear at a reasonable price for the entire family. Our performance products are for professional and recreational athletes who want a technical shoe that performs under the demands of competition. Our occupational footwear is designed to meet the specifications and demands of the service, medical and construction industries while also meeting testing specifications in the markets where the product is sold.
 We believe that our products’ success is related to our ability to recognize trends in the footwear markets and to design products that anticipate and accommodate consumers’ ever-evolving preferences. Lifestyle trend information is compiled and analyzed by our designers in various ways, including reviewing and analyzing pop culture, clothing, and trend-setting media; consulting with our customers for information on current retail selling trends; participating in major footwear trade shows to stay abreast of popular brands, fashions and styles; and subscribing to various fashion and color information services. In addition, a key component of our design philosophy is to continually reinterpret and improve our most successful styles.
 SOURCING
 Factories. Our products are produced by independent contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We believe that the use of independent manufacturers substantially increases our production flexibility and capacity, while reducing capital expenditures and avoiding the costs of managing a large production work force.
 When possible, we seek to use manufacturers that have previously produced our footwear, which we believe enhances continuity and quality while controlling production costs. To help avoid disruption of our product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, economic instability, changes in government policies or regulations, natural and manmade disasters, and other risks, we source product from multiple facilities across multiple countries. We believe that the existing production capacity at our third-party manufacturers’ facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume in the foreseeable future.
 Production Oversight. To safeguard product quality and consistency, we oversee the key aspects of production from initial prototype manufacture, through initial production runs, to final manufacture. Monitoring of all production is performed in the U.S. by our in-house production department and in Asia by staff working from our offices in China and Vietnam. We believe that our Asia presence allows us to negotiate supplier and manufacturer arrangements more effectively, decrease product turnaround time, and ensure timely delivery of finished footwear. In addition, we require our manufacturers to operate in a manner consistent with the Skechers Supplier Code of Conduct posted on our corporate website. We partner with factories that ensure humane conditions for their employees and we engage in routine auditing and monitoring procedures to ensure that those who contribute to our product are treated with civility and respect.
 Quality Control. We believe quality control is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products and brand. Our quality control program is designed to ensure finished goods meet our established design specifications and all goods bearing our trademarks meet our standards for quality. Our quality control personnel located in China and Vietnam perform an array of inspection procedures at various stages of the production process, including examination and testing of prototypes of key raw materials prior to manufacture, samples and materials at various stages of production and final products prior to shipment. Our employees are on-site at each of our major manufacturers to oversee production. For some of our lower volume manufacturers, our staff is on-site during significant production runs, or we perform unannounced visits to their manufacturing sites to further monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications.

Sustainability. We believe sustainability is an important responsibility in managing our business. In 2021, we introduced Our Planet Matters, a collection for men, women and kids that utilizes recycled materials. We partnered with a global conservation organization to help fund its organization’s global efforts which align with our interests and commitment to reduce tree harvesting and emissions through packaging. 
 We worked to make our packaging more sustainable for the more-than-225 million units of Skechers that consumers purchased in 2022. Since 2016, we have reduced our products’ packaging plastics by 99% down to less than 1%; all of which is recyclable. Many facilities can now recycle 93% of Skechers-branded shoeboxes, and all of our foot forms and tissue paper packaging are recyclable and printed with soy-or water-based ink. Further, 99% of our shoeboxes meet the FSC® standard for responsible resources, and we continually look for new ways to improve with green materials, regular assessments, and assurance that our items are FSC-certified, recycled or ethically harvested. Our shipping methods reflect our green-minded approach to sustainability: master cartons are printed with soy-or-water-based ink and are 100% recyclable, and at the distribution centers managing more than 90% of our business, our outbound shipping cartons are composed of 96%-100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable.
 Many of our facilities are designed and operated with sustainability in mind, including one of America’s largest LEED Gold certified facilities at our North America distribution center in Southern California. Our expanding corporate offices in Los Angeles, California are being designed and developed to qualify for LEED Gold certification. Our European Distribution Center in Liege, Belgium, has both a BREEAM Very Good rating and a Lean and Green certification.
 ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
 With a marketing philosophy of “Unseen, Untold, Unsold,” we take a targeted and 360-degree approach to marketing to drive traffic, build brand recognition and properly position our diverse lines within the marketplace. Senior management is directly involved in shaping our image and the conception, development and implementation of our advertising and marketing activities. Our marketing strategy has an omni-channel approach, and we utilize print, outdoor, television, radio, and digital, along with public relations, influencers and social media, promotions, and in-store events. In addition, we utilize celebrity and athlete endorsers in some of our advertisements. 
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION
 We have two reportable segments: Wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer. The Company’s collections are available in approximately 180 countries and territories through department and specialty stores, and direct to consumers through digital stores and approximately 4,540 Company- and third-party-owned physical retail stores. The Company manages its international business through a network of wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint venture partners, and distributors. 
 Our subsidiaries and joint ventures merchandise, market and distribute Skechers product to generate sales in their countries, and we consolidate their results in our financial statements. Our joint venture interests include China, Malaysia and Singapore (50%), Thailand and Israel (51%), Mexico (60%), and South Korea (65%). Where we do not sell directly through our international subsidiaries and joint ventures, our footwear is distributed through a network of distributors and licensees who sell our products to department, athletic and specialty stores. 
 
Wholesale. Our Wholesale segment primarily comprises sales to a vast network of partners. These include: department stores, family shoe stores, specialty running and sporting goods retailers, and big box club stores; franchisee and licensee third-party store operators representing approximately 3,100 Skechers branded stores worldwide; dedicated e-commerce retailers; and international distributors.
 Direct-to-Consumer. Our Direct-to-Consumer segment primarily comprises sales by Skechers directly to consumers through a combination of channels. These include approximately 1,450 company-owned retail stores in formats consisting of concept, factory outlet and big box; digital commerce sites and mobile applications; and hosted direct-to-consumer sales through marketplaces in select international markets 
 We pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy through our integrated retail formats, which enable us to promote the full Skechers product offering in an attractive environment that appeals to a broad group of consumers. 
  
• | E-commerce – Our company-owned e-commerce business enables consumers to shop, browse, find store locations, socially interact, post reviews, and immerse themselves in our brands.

LICENSING
 We believe that selective licensing of the Skechers brand name and our product line names to manufacturers broadens and enhances the individual brands without requiring significant capital investments or additional incremental operating expenses. Our multiple product lines plus additional subcategories present many potential licensing opportunities on terms that we believe will provide more effective manufacturing, distribution or marketing of non-footwear products. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 27 active licensing agreements in which we are the licensor. We license a variety of Skechers-branded products including apparel, accessories, socks and eyewear; medical scrubs; fitness and yoga accessories, and cold weather products. Additional category-specific collections include Skechers Sport apparel, bags, backpacks and headwear; Twinkle Toes backpacks and lunchboxes; BOBS from Skechers socks and backpacks; and Skechers Work socks. We also have BOBS from Skechers pet accessories in Petco.
DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
 We believe that strong distribution support is a critical factor in our operations. Our distribution network includes (i) an approximately 2.6 million square-foot North American distribution center located in California, (ii) an approximately 2.2 million square-foot European distribution center located in Belgium, (iii) an approximately 1.6 million square foot China distribution center, (iv) an approximately 0.3 million square foot United Kingdom distribution center, (v) company-operated distribution centers or third-party distribution centers in Central America, South America and Asia, and (vi) third-party manufacturers and other international third-party distribution centers.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 We own and utilize a variety of trademarks, including the Skechers trademark. We have a significant number of both registrations and pending applications for our U.S. trademarks. In addition, we have trademark registrations and trademark applications in 162 foreign countries. We have design patents and pending design and utility patent applications in both the U.S. and 39 foreign countries. We continuously look to increase the number of our patents and trademarks both domestically and internationally, where necessary to protect our intellectual property. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in marketing our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, including through the use of cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings and lawsuits.
COMPETITION
 The global footwear industry is a competitive business. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to its entire range of products, our products compete with other branded products within their product category as well as with private label products sold by retailers, including some of our customers. We also compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of footwear for the limited shelf space available for displaying such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows ease of access by new market entrants. Some of our competitors are larger, have been in existence for a longer period of time, have strong brand recognition, have captured greater market share and/or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 15,100 persons, of whom approximately 7,800 were employed on a full-time basis and approximately 7,300 were employed on a part-time basis, primarily in our retail stores.
 Social Responsibility. As a family-focused brand, Skechers was founded on inclusivity, diversity, respect and entrepreneurial spirit with the philosophy of putting people first – offering comfort and care to our employees and customers. In conjunction with our policy against discrimination, Skechers emphasizes that every employee, applicant, contractor and customer is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Human rights is a core value at the heart of how we conduct our business, at every level of the Company – including our factories and suppliers. All full-time and part-time corporate employees in the U.S. undergo harassment and diversity training, and 
 5


employees of our wholly-owned operations in other countries comply with their local laws regarding human rights, harassment and diversity training in the workplace. As it relates to our factories and suppliers specifically, we provide employee and management training to ensure that employees and companies who oversee our production and manufacturer auditing know the most current issues regarding human rights. Our Code of Ethics, Corporate Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct codify these values and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. These codes are in the Corporate Governance section of the Investor Relations page of our corporate information website located at https://investors.skechers.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. We intend to post any amendment to, or waivers of, these codes on our website. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through our website, is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of this annual report. 
 Skechers is focused on reducing its carbon footprint. We have made environmental advancements a top priority at our corporate facilities. Now under construction, our expanding corporate offices remain future-focused as we incorporate our earth-friendly philosophy into our growing footprint. All four corporate buildings are being designed to receive LEED Gold certification upon completion, and include solar panels.
 Community. Skechers encourages active participation in the greater community, with annual charity walks for children in the U.S. and around the world. We promote charitable giving and volunteering by sponsoring community service days along with blood drives, food drives, and shoe drives. Additionally, we regularly donate product to not-for-profit organizations. In 2022, the Company donated over 105,000 pairs of new shoes to those in need, more than $1.5 million to Petco Love Foundation to help save the lives of animals in need in the U.S. and Canada.
 Health and Safety. Skechers’ lifestyle and performance product offering has shaped our culture with a focus on wellness, and a commitment to providing a safe and healthful work environment for all employees. The Company offers healthy lunch options, an in-house fitness consultant and corporate exercise programs. We offer paid time off to get the COVID-19 vaccine and provided on-site vaccination clinics for our corporate employees and our domestic distribution center employees. We made changes to our corporate facilities, increasing cleaning protocols and distributing personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to employees; installing touchless doors and faucets in common areas.
 Talent. We offer competitive benefits in a casual, creative atmosphere and a fun, fast-paced environment where employees can always learn and grow. Employee benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, and help them balance their work and personal lives. Benefits include health and wellness programs, training and development programs, an employee stock purchase program, a childcare incentive program, on-site electric vehicle charging stations, and product discounts.
