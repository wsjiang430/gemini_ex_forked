Item 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our two lead product candidates are revumenib (SNDX-5613), and axatilimab (SNDX-6352). We are developing revumenib, a potent, selective, small molecule inhibitor of the menin-MLL binding interaction for the treatment of KMT2A rearranged, or KMT2Ar, also known as mixed lineage leukemia rearranged or MLLr, acute leukemias including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and NPM1 mutant AML. We are also developing axatilimab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the colony stimulating factor 1, or CSF-1 receptor, in chronic graft-versus-host disease, or cGVHD, as well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. We plan to continue to leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional therapeutics to expand our pipeline.
 Our Strategy
We are developing revumenib in acute leukemias and axatilimab for use in cGVHD and potentially other fibrotic-macrophage driven diseases, such as IPF, as single agents and in combination with approved drugs. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Develop revumenib for the treatment of genetically defined leukemias. We believe that revumenib has the potential to treat at least two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) KMT2Ar and (ii) mutations in NPM1, or NPM1c, AML. Our Phase 1/2 open-label AUGMENT-101 trial is ongoing. We have initiated the pivotal Phase 2 portion of the trial with relapsed/refractory, or R/R, patients to be enrolled in three indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine the efficacy, short- and long-term safety, and tolerability of revumenib in KMT2Ar ALL, KMT2Ar AML and NPM1c AML. We are also concurrently expanding into the frontline and maintenance settings with new trials.
 •Develop axatilimab for the treatment of cGVHD. We have completed enrollment in the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and, together with Incyte, plan to commence a clinical trial testing axatilimab in combination with ruxolitinib in steroid naive cGVHD. We are also exploring the use of axatilimab to treat other fibrotic diseases where monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play a role, such as IPF.
 •Leverage the technical, clinical, regulatory and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional cancer therapies to expand our pipeline. We licensed the global rights to axatilimab and revumenib and are working closely with our collaboration partner, Incyte, on the development and commercialization of axatilimab. We are continuing to leverage the collective talent within our organization and network of advisors to guide our pipeline expansion and development plans.
Our Pipeline
 
Revumenib
 
Our first clinical-stage product candidate, revumenib, is a potent, orally active inhibitor of the high affinity interaction site on menin with the protein MLL1. This specific interaction is a key driver for two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) KMT2Ar and (ii) NPM1c AML. The R/R settings of both diseases have a poor prognosis. In preclinical testing, revumenib has demonstrated benefit in leukemic models of disease. Initial clinical evidence with revumenib also supports the hypothesis that disruption of the menin-MLL interaction can lead to responses in acute leukemias.
 
Our near-term focus is to rapidly establish proof-of-concept that revumenib is a targeted therapy that can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefit to adult and pediatric R/R patients with mNPM1 and KMT2Ar, ALL

or AML. In 2019, we commenced AUGMENT-101, a clinical trial consisting initially of a Phase 1 dose escalation portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase 2 dose of revumenib in patients with R/R KMT2Ar or NPM1c acute leukemia. We are conducting the trial at multiple centers globally. As discussed below, we have completed the Phase 1 portion of the trial, and the pivotal Phase 2 portion of the trial is ongoing, enrolling R/R patients across each of three distinct trial populations: patients with NPM1 mutant AML, patients with KMT2Ar AML, and patients with KMT2Ar ALL to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of revumenib. Based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, AUGMENT-101 may serve as the basis for regulatory filings in each of the three populations.
On November 3, 2022, we announced updated data from the Phase 1 portion of the ongoing AUGMENT-101 trial of revumenib in patients with R/R NPM1 mutant or MLLr acute leukemia. As of the March 2022 data cutoff date, 60 patients with R/R mNPM1 or KMT2Ar acute leukemia were evaluable for efficacy, an increase of 9 patients from the 51 evaluable for efficacy at the 2021 ASH Annual Meeting. In the efficacy evaluable population, the overall response rate, which we define as CR, plus CRh, plus CRp, plus MLFS, was 53% (32/60), with CR/CRh rate of 30% (18/60), and 78% (14/18) of patients with CR/CRh attaining minimal residual disease, or MRD, negativity. Additional analyses from the trial indicate that at doses which met the protocol defined criteria for a recommended Phase 2 dose, the CR/CRh rate was 27% in both the KMT2Ar (10/37) and the mutant NPM1 (3/11) patient populations. A total of 38% (12/32) of responders proceeded to transplant. The median time to response in the trial was 1.9 months, and the median duration of CR/CRh response was 9.1 months in the efficacy evaluable population as of data cutoff. Revumenib was well-tolerated, and there were no discontinuations due to treatment related adverse events. This data was featured in two oral sessions at the 2022 ASH Annual Meeting.
 The data shows that revumenib has been well tolerated to date, and no new safety signals were identified in the trial, including in patients who proceeded to stem cell transplant. The only dose limiting toxicity observed was asymptomatic Grade 3 QT prolongation. No ventricular arrythmias or other clinical sequelae related to QTc prolongation were reported. All cases of differentiation syndrome were Grade 2 and readily managed with standard therapies. Grade 3 and greater treatment-related adverse events other than dose limiting toxicity included diarrhea (3%), fatigue (3%), anemia (3%), tumor lysis syndrome (2%), neutropenia (2%), thrombocytopenia (2%), hypercalcemia (2%) and hypokalemia (2%).
Two trials, BEAT-AML and AUGMENT-102, are ongoing and will assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-leukemic efficacy of revumenib and establish an appropriate Phase 2 dose when used in combination with other approved agents. BEAT-AML is a front-line combination trial of revumenib with venetoclax and azacitidine being conducted as part of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Beat AML® Master Clinical Trial. AUGMENT-102 is a trial assessing revumenib in combination with chemotherapy in patients with R/R mNPM1 or KMT2Ar acute leukemias.
In the first quarter of 2023, the Australasian Leukemia and Lymphoma Group initiated the INTERCEPT trial of revumenib as monotherapy in patients with AML who are minimal residual disease-positive following initial treatment. The trial is a part of the INTERCEPT AML Master Clinical Trial, a collaborative clinical trial investigating novel therapies to target early relapse and clonal evolution as pre-emptive therapy in AML. Revumenib is the first menin inhibitor to be included in the INTERCEPT AML Master Clinical Trial.
Also in the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a proof-of-concept clinical trial of revumenib in patients with unresectable metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, or CRC. We expect to report initial topline data from the trial by the end of 2023.
In January 2020, the FDA granted revumenib Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, for the treatment of adult and pediatric AML and in June 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to revumenib for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias harboring a MLLr or NPM1 mutation. In December 2021, we announced that the European Commission granted ODD to revumenib for the treatment of AML. On December 5, 2022, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, for

revumenib for the treatment of R/R acute leukemia harboring a KMT2A rearrangement, regardless of age or tumor type. Following the receipt of BTD, we will pool data from the AUGMENT-101 cohorts enrolling R/R KMT2Ar AML and R/R KMT2Ar ALL to file a single New Drug Application, or NDA, for the treatment of adult and pediatric KMT2Ar acute leukemia. We have completed enrollment of a sufficient number of KMT2Ar acute leukemia patients to support this filing strategy and expect to share topline data from the KMT2Ar cohort in the third quarter of 2023, and submit an NDA filing by the end of 2023. We also expect to complete enrollment of the NPM1 AML cohort in the second half of 2023.
 Revumenib
 Rationale for Targeting MLLr
 MLLr leukemias arise by rare, spontaneous translocations at the MLL1 locus (11q23). It is estimated that approximately 10% of AML and ALL harbor this MLL-re-arrangement with a worldwide incidence of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 cases per year. These translocations generate oncogenic fusion proteins with more than 90 different MLL fusions currently known. All MLL fusion proteins bind with high affinity to the chromatin associated protein menin through a conserved N-terminal sequence. This specific interaction with menin enables an aberrant transcription program that drives leukemic transformation. In pre-clinical animal models, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated deep and durable single agent treatment effects in multiple leukemic xenografts harboring MLL fusions. Inhibiting the menin-MLL1 interaction represents a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of MLLr leukemias. Today, the first choice therapy for both MLLr AML and MLLr ALL still relies heavily on intensive chemotherapy, if a patient can tolerate such treatment. Despite these patients being routinely diagnosed, there are currently no targeted therapies approved to treat patients with MLLr acute leukemias. Currently there are several other clinical-stage menin-inhibitors in development for the treatment of MLLr AML and MLLr ALL.
Rationale for Targeting Nucleophosmin 1 Mutant AML
 NPM1 is among the most frequently mutated genes in AML, found in approximately 30% of AML cases for an incidence of approximately 20,000 cases per year. Mutations in NPM1, or NPM1c, lead to the aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the mutants. NPM1c lead to its aberrant cytoplasmic localization. Recent preclinical research has demonstrated that NPM1c works directly with the menin-MLL complex to induce a leukemic transcription program. As a result, NPM1c harboring cells are sensitive to menin-MLL interaction inhibitors. In NPM1c cells, inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction suppresses the leukemic transcription program, causing growth arrest, terminal differentiation and cell death. In animal models, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated deep and durable single agent treatment effects in multiple NPM1c xenografts. Based on these findings, blocking the menin-MLL1 interaction represents a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of NPM1c AML.
 Like MLLr, NPM1 is readily diagnosed as part of the standard AML patient work-up today, and yet there are no targeted therapies specifically approved to treat patients with NPM1c AML. There are several additional clinical stage agents currently advancing as potential treatments for NPM1c AML.

Rational for Targeting CRC


CRC is the second most lethal cancer, the third most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide, and the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. In 2022, over 150,000 new CRC cases arose, and 52,000 deaths were reported, accounting for nearly 10% of new cancer cases and deaths in the U.S. Meanwhile, the five-year survival rate for CRC is approximately 65% and drops to 15% for metastatic CRC. 
Today, physicians can choose from a number of approved chemotherapies (Stivarga,® Lonsurf®), immunotherapies (Yervoy®, Keytruda®, Opdivo®) and targeted agents (Avastin®, Cyramza®, Zaltrap®, Erbitux®, Vectibix®, Braftovi®) to treat CRC. Despite these advancements, there remains a critical need for more effective therapies to address metastatic CRC.
Nearly all colorectal tumors, harbor genetic mutations that lead to the hyperactivation of b-catenin signaling, which in turn initiate the expression of various downstream targets that promote proliferation and maintain a stem cell state, highlighting the potential value of developing treatments that target b-catenin signaling in cancer. b-catenin itself, however, is an intractable drug target and the mechanisms underlying b-catenin–driven transcription remain largely elusive, underscoring the need to identify therapeutically tractable components of b-catenin transcriptional output. Recently, several researchers have utilized functional genomic screens to uncover new targets of high relevance to the oncogenic property of b-catenin. Through this process they have validated the selective dependence of KMT2A for growth of b-catenin–active CRC cells and showed KMT2A expression to be associated with malignant CRC growth in vivo and shortened survival in patients with CRC. Targeting KMT2A using menin inhibitors has been shown to selectively reduce the viability of b-catenin–active cells and CRC organoids, but not b-catenin–inactive cells and normal organoids. 
Axatilimab
 We are also developing axatilimab a monoclonal antibody targeting the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. Axatilimab binds with high affinity to CSF-1R and blocks the binding of the two known CSF-1R ligands CSF-1 and IL-34. CSF-1R is expressed on the surface of specific immune cells known as macrophages and their precursor cells known as monocytes. CSF-1R signaling on these cells has been demonstrated in preclinical studies conducted in animal models of skin and lung cGVHD to be the key regulatory pathway involved in the expansion and infiltration of the macrophages that mediate fibrosis and the cGVHD disease process. Blocking CSF-1R activity with an experimental CSF-1R antibody in these studies was shown to prevent and treat the symptoms of cGVHD. We believe that by inhibiting CSF-1R activation on monocytes and macrophages, axatilimab has the potential to be used to treat cGVHD as well as other fibrotic diseases where monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play a significant role.
 

Our near-term focus is to rapidly establish that axatilimab can provide meaningful clinical benefit in patients with advanced cGVHD where prior therapies are no longer effective and to establish proof-of-concept of using axatilimab to treat other fibrotic diseases where monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play a role.
On November 3, 2022, we and Incyte announced completion of enrollment in the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with cGVHD following two or more prior lines of therapy. The trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of three dosing regimens of axatilimab. The primary endpoint will assess objective response rate based on the 2014 NIH consensus criteria for cGVHD, with key secondary endpoints including duration of response and improvement in modified Lee Symptom Scale score. Together with Incyte, we expect to report topline data in mid-2023, and if successful, expect to submit a Biologics License Application by the end of 2023.
In the first half of 2023, we plan to initiate a Phase 2b trial to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of axatilimab in patients with IPF. This 52-week, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial is expected to enroll approximately 170 patients. The primary endpoint will assess the change from baseline in forced vital capacity, which is the current registrational endpoint in IPF.
We are working with Incyte to initiate a trial testing axatilimab in combination with ruxolitinib in steroid naive cGVHD. The Phase 1 trial is expected to begin later this year.
In March and April of 2021, we announced that the FDA granted ODD to axatilimab for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and IPF.
 Axatilimab in GVHD
 cGVHD, an immune response of the donor-derived hematopoietic cells against recipient tissues, is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, that can last for years. cGVHD is estimated to develop in approximately 40% of transplant recipients and affects approximately 14,000 patients in the United States. cGVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with the skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue.
 The first line of therapy for cGVHD is typically corticosteroids, though approximately 50% of patients may require treatment with additional systemic therapies, such as extracorporeal photopheresis, cytostatic agents such as mycophenolate moftetil, methotrexate, and immunomodulators such as rituximab, IL-2. Imbruvica® (ibrutinib), a BTK inhibitor, was the first FDA-approved therapy for cGVHD and is indicated for use after one or more lines of therapy. Imbruvica received approval based on Phase 1/2 clinical trial data that showed a 68% overall response rate, with 48% of responses lasting 20 weeks or longer and reduced dependence on steroids for most patients. The FDA has approved two additional drugs, Rezurock® (belomosidil) and Jakafi® (ruxolitinib), for use in patients with cGVHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. While approved agents have shown a benefit in improving symptoms of this disease, none have demonstrated an improvement in long-term outcomes and a significant unmet medical need still remains for this patient population. Additionally, all currently approved agents are believed to exert their effect through T- and B-cells, with minimal impact on macrophages. By inhibiting the work of monocyte-derived macrophages, Axatilimab, provides a differentiated way to treat cGVHD, which we expect is ultimately expected to have a more pronounced impact on the fibrotic process. We also believe that shifting CSF-1R inhibition earlier in the treatment phase of cGVHD, to minimize formation of fibrotic tissue, could have a meaningful long-term impact on the disease process itself.
 Axatilimab in IPF
 IPF is a specific form of chronic, fibrosing, interstitial pneumonia limited to the lungs with a median survival of approximately three to five years after diagnosis. IPF is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 281,000 people among the seven major market countries. IPF incidence and prevalence increase with age and are higher

among males. Although rare, the incidence of IPF is increasing, likely due to an increasing understanding of the disease and the recent development of uniform diagnostic criteria.
 There are currently two approved therapies for IPF, nintedanib and pirfenidone. Despite these recent advances, the unmet medical need in IPF remains high, with a five-year mortality rate of 50% to 70% with deaths occurring mainly due to respiratory failure. Lung transplantation remains the only curative treatment option, but less than five percent of IPF patients undergo lung transplantation. There is an urgent need for new and more effective treatments for IPF that can address the limitations of current treatment options, improve mortality, and quality of life.
 Growing evidence suggests macrophages are critical regulators of lung fibrosis. Recent work has established a role for monocyte-derived macrophages as the pathogenic population of cells required for the development of fibrosis and that drive the fibrotic process. Reducing the circulating levels of pathogenic monocyte-derived macrophage precursors or inhibiting their activation in tissues provides an opportunity to therapeutically intervene and directly inhibit fibrosis. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the monocyte-derived, pro-fibrotic macrophages are CSF-1-dependent and CSF-1R inhibition through anti-CSF-1R antibody can block fibrosis in fibrotic disease models. We believe that using axatilimab to inhibit the work of monocyte-derived macrophages may provide a differentiated way to treat IPF, and could result in a more pronounced impact on the fibrotic process. 
Entinostat
Entinostat is our oral, small molecule product candidate that has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, potentially enhancing the body’s immune response to tumors. We have deprioritized the development of entinostat, but maintain a license, development and commercialization agreement with Eddingpharm International Company Limited, or Eddingpharm, under which we granted Eddingpharm an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize entinostat in China and certain other Asian countries.
Collaborations
 Incyte Collaboration and License Agreement
 In September 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, with Incyte for the development and commercialization of axatilimab. Additionally, in September 2021 we entered into a share purchase agreement with Incyte, or the Incyte Share Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, Incyte received exclusive commercialization rights outside of the United States, and we and Incyte will, subject to the exercise of our co-promotion option, have co-commercialization rights in the United States, with respect to axatilimab. Incyte is responsible for leading commercialization strategy and booking all revenue from worldwide sales of axatilimab, subject to its royalty payment obligations set forth below. The parties will share equally the profits and losses from the co-commercialization efforts. We and Incyte are co-developing axatilimab and sharing development costs associated with global and U.S.-specific clinical trials, with Incyte responsible for 55% of such costs and we are responsible for 45% of such costs. Each company is responsible for funding any independent development activities. All development costs related to the collaboration are subject to a joint development plan. A joint development committee between us and Incyte will govern future development of axatilimab.
 We are eligible to receive up to $220 million in future contingent development and regulatory milestones and up to $230 million in commercialization milestones under the Incyte Collaboration Agreement. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on potential net sales of the licensed product comprising axatilimab ranging from the low to mid double-digit percentages. In December 2021, we received an upfront cash payment of $117 million and we issued 1,421,523 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35 million, or $24.62 per share.
License Agreements
 Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 We have a license agreement with Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of AbbVie plc, or the AbbVie License Agreement, under which Vitae granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to, preclinical, orally-available, small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of menin with the MLL protein, or the Menin Assets.

The amount was paid in the first quarter of 2023.
 Each party may terminate the AbbVie License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the AbbVie License Agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to Vitae. Vitae may terminate the AbbVie License Agreement if we or any of its affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the AbbVie License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country.
UCB
We have a license agreement with UCB, or the UCB license agreement, under which UCB granted us a worldwide, sublicensable, exclusive license to UCB6352, which we refer to as axatilimab. The UCB license agreement permits us to use axatilimab or other licensed products for all human uses, including treatment, prevention and diagnostic uses, in all indications, diseases, conditions or disorders, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize a certain licensed product. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of axatilimab.
 Subject to the achievement of certain milestone events, we may be required to pay UCB up to $119.5 million in one-time development and regulatory milestone payments over the term of the UCB license agreement. In the event that we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees commercializes axatilimab, we will also be obligated to pay UCB low double-digit royalties on sales, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as well as up to an aggregate of $250.0 million in potential one-time, sales-based milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to share a percentage of non-royalty income from sublicensees, subject to certain deductions, with UCB. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we were required to pay $2.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, due to the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Additionally, in connection with its most recent amendment of the UCB License Agreement, in the second quarter of 2022 we paid UCB $5.8 million, which was recognized as a milestone expense.


Each party may terminate the UCB license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the UCB license agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to UCB. UCB may terminate the UCB license agreement if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the UCB license agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country.
Bayer Pharma AG
 We have a license agreement with Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize entinostat and any other products containing the same active ingredient. The Bayer license agreement, as amended, permits us to use entinostat or other licensed products for the treatment of any human disease, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products for all commercially reasonable indications. Initially, Bayer manufactured and supplied our requirements of entinostat, but effective May 2012, manufacturing rights and responsibility for entinostat was transferred to us, by mutual agreement of the parties.
We are obligated to pay up to approximately $50.0 million in the aggregate upon obtaining certain milestones in the development and marketing approval of entinostat, assuming that we pursue at least two different indications for entinostat or any other licensed product. We are also obligated to pay Bayer up to $100.0 million in aggregate sales milestones, and a tiered single-digit royalty on net sales by us, our affiliates and sublicensees of entinostat and any other licensed products under the Bayer license agreement. We are obligated to pay Bayer these royalties on a country-by-country basis for the life of the relevant licensed patents covering such product or 15 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, whichever is longer. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Bayer would expire because no commercial sales of entinostat have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering entinostat in a given country may change in the future.
The Bayer license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations under the agreement in all countries. Upon expiration of the agreement our licenses become fully paid-up and irrevocable. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement in its entirety or with respect to certain countries in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement if voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings are instituted against the other party, if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or upon the occurrence of other specific events relating to the insolvency or dissolution of the other party. Bayer may terminate the Bayer license agreement if we seek to revoke or challenge the validity of any patent licensed to us by Bayer under the Bayer license agreement or if we procure or assist a third party to take any such action.
Eddingpharm International Company Limited
 We have a license, development and commercialization agreement with Eddingpharm International Company Limited, or Eddingpharm, under which we granted Eddingpharm an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize entinostat in China and certain other Asian countries. This license includes a sublicense under the rights we received under the Bayer license agreement. If we acquire or develop any other anti-cancer drug that, like entinostat, is a selective inhibitor of Class I HDAC, such drug will be included in this license as well. Eddingpharm is manufacturing entinostat during the term of the agreement or through termination of the agreement for our breach. During the term of the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each party is prohibited from commercializing in China and certain other Asian countries any other selective inhibitor of Class I HDACs for the same indication as entinostat, with all forms of cancer being treated as the same indication.
 We are eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments as well as royalty payments based on revenue targets. Royalty payment obligations will be payable in each country in the Eddingpharm territory until the later to occur of (i) the date that all valid claims of the last effective license patent in such country expires or is abandoned, withheld or otherwise invalidated and (ii) 15 years from the date of first commercial sale of entinostat in such country. Any payments owed to Bayer as a result of Eddingpharm’s

development of entinostat in the Eddingpharm territory will be made by us out of the payments we receive from Eddingpharm.
 The agreement with Eddingpharm will expire with respect to each country in the Eddingpharm territory upon the expiration of all royalty payment obligations in such country. In addition, we may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice to Eddingpharm if Eddingpharm or any affiliate commences any action or proceeding that challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent in the Eddingpharm territory. Eddingpharm may terminate the agreement in its entirety for convenience at any time upon advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, or bankruptcy or related actions or proceedings. If we commit an uncured material breach of certain provisions of the agreement, Eddingpharm may, instead of terminating the agreement, elect to continue the agreement in full force and effect except certain payments to us will be reduced.
 Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have recently started building a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our product candidates in the United States. We expect that our targeted sales force will focus on a well-defined group of medical oncologists, primarily in the non-hospital and academic settings, who are responsible for the care and treatment of cancer patients. For revumenib, we expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. In accordance with our agreement, Incyte will lead the commercialization of axatilimab globally and we will elect whether to co-promote axatilimab in the United States. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we would also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Outside the United States, we plan to rely on our current partners and may seek additional pharmaceutical partners for sales and marketing activities.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of axatilimab, revumenib or entinostat, and we do not have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers as well as Incyte for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have any current contractual relationship for the manufacture of commercial supplies. If axatilimab, revumenib or entinostat is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of such product. Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval.
Intellectual Property
 Patents and Property Rights
 Through licensed intellectual property and our owned intellectual property, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as for other technologies, where appropriate. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad claiming our proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us or our licensors in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be granted to us or to our licensors in the future will protect our technology. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights.
Axatilimab Patent Portfolio
 We in-licensed from UCB a patent portfolio directed to axatilimab. As of December 31, 2022, the axatilimab composition-of-matter patent portfolio included two granted U.S. patents, 27 granted non-U.S. patents, including a granted EP patent which has been validated in 37 countries, and 16 non-U.S. pending patent applications. The in-licensed granted patents covering axatilimab, and any non-U.S. pending applications should they issue, will expire in August 2034 or later should patent term extension be granted.
 Our in-licensed patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications directed to methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of fibrotic disease by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, and liquid pharmaceutical compositions of anti-CSF-1R antibodies.

If any one of these applications were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire in May 2038 or later should patent term extension be granted. Our owned axatilimab patent portfolio also consists of one pending international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, directed to the treatment regimens and methods of using axatilimab includes one pending U.S. patent application and 18 non-U.S. patent applications. If this PCT application were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire in December 2040 or later should patent term extension be granted.
 Menin Asset Patent Portfolio
 We in-licensed from Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of AbbVie plc, a patent portfolio directed to a series of selective preclinical inhibitors targeting the binding interaction of menin with MLL-r. As of December 31, 2022, the in-licensed portfolio includes three granted U.S. patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 11,479,557, 10,683,302 and 10,899,758, 13 granted non-U.S patents, including a granted European patent, which was validated in 30 member states, four allowed non-U.S patent applications, two pending U.S. applications and 20 non-U.S. pending patent applications covering composition of matter and methods of treating, e.g., MLL. The granted patents based on the in-licensed applications are expected to expire June 2037 or later should patent term extension be granted. If the in-licensed application were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between June 2037 and September 2037.
 Our owned menin patent portfolio consists of eleven pending non-U.S. patent applications and one U.S. patent application, directed to combinations of a menin inhibitor and a CYP3A inhibitor for the treatment of various cancers. Our owned menin patent portfolio also consists of two U.S. provisional applications directed to menin inhibitors and combinations with various other compounds. If any applications arising from the provisional applications were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between April 2041 and May 2043 or later should patent term extension be granted.
 We also co-own with Vitae and Syngene International Limited two pending non-U.S. patent applications, one pending U.S. patent application, and one pending PCT, covering composition of matter and methods of treating cancer and other diseases mediated by the menin-MLL interaction.


Entinostat Patent Portfolio
 We strive to protect entinostat with multiple layers of patents. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio included four owned pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three owned granted U.S. patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 10,226,472, 11,324,822, and 11,397,184 which expire in August 2032, March 2036 and September 2036, respectively, or later should patent term extension be granted, directed to methods of treating a patient with combinations of entinostat and pembrolizumab or other therapeutic agents, nine granted non-U.S. patents (including two European patents validated in at least 5 countries), three allowed non-U.S. patent applications, and 39 owned non-U.S. pending patent applications. Our owned entinostat patent portfolio includes pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat and exemestane, methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat in combination with an HER2 inhibitor, treatments with entinostat combined with anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibodies, entinostat and CSF-1 or CSF-1R combination therapies (also discussed above in the Axatilimab Patent Portfolio) and patient selection for combination therapy comprising entinostat and a second therapeutic agent. If our owned pending U.S. applications and non-U.S. applications were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between August 2032 and May 2039 or later should patent term extension be granted.
The patent portfolio we licensed from Bayer contains a number of issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as patent applications pending outside the United States. A number of the patents and patent applications we licensed from Bayer are directed to entinostat while other patents and patent applications are directed to compounds other than entinostat. As of December 31, 2022, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer included seven issued U.S. patents, 62 granted non-U.S. patents and 17 patent applications pending in non-U.S. patent offices. For example, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer includes reissue U.S. Patent RE39,754, which covers a genus of benzamide compounds including entinostat or SNDX-275. RE39,754 is a composition of matter patent having an initial term which expired in September 2017.
The portfolio we licensed from Bayer also includes U.S. Patent 7,973,166, or the ’166- patent, which covers a crystalline polymorph of entinostat which is referred to as crystalline polymorph- B, the crystalline polymorph used in the clinical development of entinostat. Many compounds can exist in different crystalline forms. A compound which in the solid state may exhibit multiple different crystalline forms is called polymorphic, and each crystalline form of the same chemical compound is termed a polymorph. A new crystalline form of a compound may arise, for example, due to a change in the chemical process or the introduction of an impurity. Such new crystalline forms may be patented. By comparison, the U.S. Patent RE39,754, which expired in September 2017, covers the chemical entity of entinostat and any crystalline or non-crystalline form of entinostat. On March 7, 2014, our licensor Bayer applied for reissue of the ‘166 patent. The reissue application sought to add three additional inventors to the ‘166 patent. The reissue was granted as RE45,499 on April 28, 2015, at which time the original ‘166 patent was surrendered. The reissue patent has the same force and effect as the original ‘166 patent and the same August 2029 expiration date.
Of the unexpired foreign-granted patents we licensed from Bayer, there are 33 granted foreign counterparts of the ‘166 patent (now RE45,499) that cover crystalline polymorph B, including the European patent and Eurasian patent. The granted European patent comprises 37 national countries that have all been validated, and the granted Eurasian patent comprises nine countries that have all been validated. Likewise, there are 3 pending foreign counterparts of the ‘166 crystalline polymorph B patent. Other patents and patent applications in the licensed Bayer portfolio are expired and cover methods of treatment by administration of entinostat. For example, U.S. Patent 7,317,028, which expired in October 2017, covers methods of treating selected cancers by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 7,687,525, which also expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating autoimmune disease by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 6,320,078, which expired in July 2019, covers methods of manufacturing entinostat; U.S. Patent No. 8,026,239, which expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating certain malignant tumors by administration of a compound within a subgenus of benzamide compounds including entinostat; U.S. Patent RE40,703, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat; and U.S. Patent 6,794,392, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat.
Patent Term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the earliest non-provisional application or PCT application.
In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The term of a patent that covers an approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and regulatory review process. To obtain a patent extension in the United States, the term of the relevant patent must not have expired before the extension application, the patent cannot have been extended previously under this law, an application for extension must be submitted, the product must be subject to regulatory review prior to its commercialization, and the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product after such regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. If our future products contain active ingredients which have not been previously approved, we may be eligible for a patent term extension in the United States. In the United States, we expect to seek extension of patent terms under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent for patent claims covering a new chemical entity. If patent extensions are available to us outside of the United States, we would expect to file for a patent term extension in applicable jurisdictions.
 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements
We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting and service agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed for us.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and related regulations. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon, among other things, the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion, and postmarket surveillance of drugs and biologics.
Biopharmaceutical Product Development Process
The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceutical products may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP regulations; 
 •submission of an IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses; 


•submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for biologics; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the application for filing and review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of an NDA or BLA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biopharmaceutical product in the United States. 
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety, toxicity profile and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND must be submitted to the FDA, and the IND must become effective. A sponsor must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the submitted data or the conduct of the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND application must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and informed consent for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap:
•Phase 1—The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk ratio of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA. 
 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues.
Some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring board or committee. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include developed methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review and Approval Processes
In order to obtain approval to market a biopharmaceutical product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
The FDA will initially review an NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. After an NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Upon the filing of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at 6 months, rather than the standard 10 months. Priority review is given for drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA or BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the product is approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the application will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved.


Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study requirements. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of an NDA must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve an NDA without an approved REMS, if required.
Expedited Review Programs
Among other programs, the FDA may expedite the review of a product candidate designated as a breakthrough therapy, which is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a drug as a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND application for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may rescind a breakthrough therapy designation in the future if further clinical development later shows that the criteria for designation are no longer met.
Breakthrough therapy designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Post-Approval Requirements
If and when approved, any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences and submitting annual reports.
 Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports to have. The FDA and certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, fail to approve any application, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of an application, or we may recall the product from distribution. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures and injunctive action.
The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics. While doctors are free to prescribe any drug approved by the FDA for any use based on the doctor’s independent medical judgement, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In

addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such products, and patients may decline to purchase them. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies. Such pressure, along with the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union, will likely put additional downward pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions, governmental laws and regulations related to government healthcare programs, healthcare reform, and pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies.
The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement to the extent products for which we may receive regulatory approval are covered under a pharmacy benefit or are otherwise subject to a formulary. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The Affordable Care Act provides, and recent government cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers support, the view that federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may implicate the False Claims Act;
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private);
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that perform certain services on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, and their covered subcontractors;
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to: (i) payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals; and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
 •state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or to adopt compliance programs as prescribed by state laws and regulations, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers, state laws that require manufactures to report pricing information regarding certain drugs, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information, which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.


We may also be subject to federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of other personal information, including federal and state consumer protection laws, state data security laws, and data breach notification laws. A data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge, investigation or legal action under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
To the extent that any of our product candidates receive approval and are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, international data protection laws (including the General Data Protection Directive ((EU) 2016/679) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data as well as EU member state implementing legislation), and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our business, including, without limitation, our ability to commercialize, and the prices we may obtain for, any of our product candidates that are approved for sale, are the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
 •an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
 •expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
 •a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of- sale discounts off negotiated prices;
 •extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
 •new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;


•a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act’s mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain but may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products once commercialized.
Regulations Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country

and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of February 22, 2023, we had 107 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 68 were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 24 have an M.D. or Ph.D degree. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Compensation and Benefits
 We consider a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee engagement, development, and training, talent acquisition and retention, employee safety and wellness, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We provide our employees with salaries and bonuses intended to be competitive for our industry, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust benefits package to promote well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition, we have conducted employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of future focus for our human capital practices and benefits offerings.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
 We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success and we are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws. We understand that varied perspectives lead to the best ideas and outcomes. We believe that by creating a workplace where every individual can feel welcome and valued, we will be better able to achieve our corporate objectives. All employees must adhere to a code of business conduct and ethics and our employee handbook, which combined, define standards for appropriate behavior and are annually trained to help prevent, identify, report, and stop any type of discrimination and harassment. Our recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation, and advancement is based on qualifications, performance, skills, and experience without regard to gender, race or ethnicity.
 Environmental, Social and Governance Commitment
 We are highly committed to policies and practices focused on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, positively impacting our social community and maintaining and cultivating good corporate governance. By focusing on ESG policies and practices, we believe that we can affect a meaningful and positive change in our communities and continue to cultivate our open and inclusive collaborative culture. Some of the initiatives that we were most proud of in 2022 included continuing support for the scientific, medical, patient and local communities in which we operate, including disease awareness and supporting community needs through both participation in events as well

as charitable giving to the community at large. We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint. Electric car charging stations are available to employees at our Massachusetts office location. We have been methodically minimizing our use of paper records in favor of electronic records and have a robust recycling program in each office for paper, batteries and electronic equipment. We enable our employees to participate in various charity events, including walks, races and other events that impact change in the communities of the patients that we serve. This allows our employees to support causes that are meaningful to them and their families and aligns with our mission, goals and vision.
Corporate and Other Information
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2005. In 2011, we established a wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, in 2014 we established a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, and in 2021, we established a wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands. There have been no material activities for these entities to date. We currently operate in one segment.
Our principal office is located in Waltham, Massachusetts, where we lease approximately 12,000 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in February 2025. We also lease approximately 4,000 square feet of office space in New York, NY pursuant to a lease that expires in August 2025. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, although we may seek to negotiate new leases or evaluate additional or alternate space for our operations. We believe appropriate alternative space will be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
 We file electronically with the SEC, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We make available on our website at www.syndax.com, under “Investors,” free of charge, copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing these reports with the SEC.
