ITEM 1.    Business
General
Heartland Express, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Nevada, which directly or indirectly owns all of the stock of the following active legal entities: Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa, Heartland Express Services, Inc., Heartland Express Maintenance Services, Inc. ("Heartland Express"), and Midwest Holding Group, LLC and Millis Transfer, LLC ("Millis Transfer"), and Smith Transport, Inc., Smith Trucking, Inc., and Franklin Logistics, Inc. ("Smith Transport"), and Transportation Resources, Inc. and Contract Freighters, Inc. (collectively with certain Mexican entities, "CFI"). On May 31, 2022, Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa acquired Smith Transport, a truckload carrier headquartered in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania. On August 31, 2022, Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa acquired CFI's non-dedicated U.S. dry van and temperature-controlled truckload business located in Joplin, Missouri, and certain Mexican entities (collectively, "CFI 
Logistica") operations located in Mexico. We, together with our subsidiaries, are a short, medium, and long-haul truckload carrier and transportation services provider. We primarily provide nationwide asset-based dry van truckload service for major shippers across the United States, along with cross-border freight and other transportation services offered through third party partnerships in Mexico.
We, together with our subsidiaries, historically have been a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier with approximately 99.9% of our operating revenue was derived from shipments within the United States with the remainder being Canada and no operations in Mexico. With the acquisition of CFI on August 31, 2022, we significantly expanded our scale and our transportation services. We continue to provide nationwide asset-based dry van truckload service for major shippers from across the U.S. and now including cross border freight to and from Mexico and our consolidated average length of haul has increased to approximately 500 miles. We continue to focus on providing high quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in our regional operating areas. We also offer truckload temperature-controlled transportation services and Mexico logistics services, which are not significant to our consolidated operations. Through the acquisition of CFI, we now provide transportation logistics services across Mexico for our customers and provide cross-border freight services for customer loads moving from the United States into Mexico and loads originating from Mexico into the United States. We utilize third party service providers for all miles run in Mexico and to move freight across the US-Mexico border while leveraging terminal locations in the US and Mexico near the border to facilitate these moves. We generally earn revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered and the revenue per mile or per load paid. We operate our consolidated operations under the brand names of Heartland Express, Millis Transfer, Smith Transport, and CFI. We manage our business based on overall corporate operating goals and objectives that are the same for all of our brands. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), our CEO, evaluates the operational efficiencies of our transportation services, operating performance and asset allocation on a combined basis based on consolidated operating goals and objectives. We believe the keys to success are maintaining high levels of customer service and safety, which are predicated on the availability of experienced drivers and late-model equipment. We believe that our service standards, safety record, and equipment accessibility have made us a core carrier to many of our major customers, as well as allowed us to build solid, long-term relationships with customers and brand ourselves as an industry leader for on-time service.
Our headquarters is located in North Liberty, Iowa, in a lower-cost environment with ready access to a skilled, educated, and industrious workforce. Our other terminals are located near major shipping corridors nationwide, affording proximity to customer locations, driver domiciles, and distribution centers. Approximately 80% of our terminals are located within 200 miles of the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. We believe our geographic reach and terminal locations assist us with driver recruiting and retention, efficient fleet maintenance, and consistent customer engagement.
We were founded by Russell A. Gerdin in 1978 and became publicly traded in November 1986. Over the thirty-six years from 1986 to 2022, we have grown our revenues to $968.0 million from $21.6 million and our net income has increased to $133.6 million from $3.0 million. For the five year period 2018 through 2022 we had the highest net income, $429.3 million, and highest revenue, $3.4 billion, of any previous five year period. Much of our growth has been attributable to expanding service for existing customers, acquiring new customers, and continued expansion of our operating regions through new and existing customers as well as strategic acquisitions. More information regarding our total assets, revenues and profits for the past three years can be found in our “Consolidated Balance Sheets” and “Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income” that are included in this report.
We continue to focus on providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in our regional operating areas. Organic growth has become increasingly difficult for traditional over-the-road truckload carriers given a shortage of qualified drivers in the industry and availability of revenue equipment assets. We have completed two recent strategic acquisitions to combat these industry challenges. In addition, we continue to evaluate and explore different driving options and offerings for our existing and potential new drivers across our unique mix of driver offerings across Heartland Express, Millis Transfer, Smith Transport, and CFI.
In addition to past organic growth through the development of our regional operating areas, we have completed ten acquisitions since 1986 with the most recent and our fifth acquisition within the last nine years, CFI, occurring on August 31, 2022 following the acquisition of Smith Transport on May 31, 2022. These ten acquisitions have enabled us to solidify our position within existing regions, expand into new operating regions, expand service offerings to address longer length of haul needs from customers, pursue new customer relationships in new markets, as well as expand business relationships with current customers in new markets. We are highly selective about acquisitions, with our main criteria being (i) safe operations, (ii) high quality professional truck drivers, (iii) fleet profile that is compatible with our philosophy or can be replaced economically, and (iv) freight profile that will allow a path to a low-80s operating ratio upon full integration, application of our cost structure, and freight optimization, including exiting certain business that fails to meet our operating profile. We have historically been a debt free organization, with the acquisition of CFI we now have a significant amount of debt. We expect to continue to evaluate 
acquisition candidates presented to us, however, we do not expect to make any significant acquisitions while we are paying down debt. We believe future growth depends upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand, the available capacity in the trucking industry, our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions, our ability to integrate operations of acquired companies to realize efficiencies, and our ability to attract and retain experienced drivers that meet our hiring standards.
Operations
Our operations department focuses on the successful execution of customer expectations and providing consistent opportunities for our drivers, in conjunction with maximizing equipment utilization. These objectives require a combined effort of marketing, regional operations managers, and fleet management.
Our customer service department is responsible for maintaining the continuity between the customer’s needs and our ability to meet those needs by communicating the customer’s expectations to the fleet management group. Collectively, the marketing and operations groups (customer service and fleet management) are charged with developing customer relationships, ensuring service standards, coordinating proper freight-to-capacity balancing, trailer asset management, and daily tactical decisions to match customer demand with revenue equipment availability across our entire network. Fleet management assigns orders to drivers based on well-defined criteria, such as United States Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) hours of service ("HOS") compliance, customer requirements, equipment utilization, driver “home time” and other driver needs, limiting non-revenue miles, and equipment maintenance needs.
Fleet management employees are responsible for driver management, development, and retention. Additionally, they maximize the capacity that is available to meet the service needs of our customers. Their responsibilities include meeting the needs of the drivers within the standards that have been set by the organization and communicating the requirements of the customers to the drivers on each order to ensure successful execution.

Serving the short-to-medium haul market permits us to use primarily single rather than team drivers and dispatch most loads directly from origin to destination without an intermediate equipment change other than for driver scheduling purposes. During 2022, approximately 70% of our loads were less than 500 miles in length of haul. Substantially all of our revenue is, and for the last three fiscal years has been, generated from within the U.S. with immaterial revenue derived from Mexico and Canada. 
We operate thirty-three terminal facilities throughout the contiguous U.S. and one in Mexico, without driver fueling and maintenance facilities, following the CFI acquisition, in addition to our terminal and corporate headquarters in North Liberty, Iowa. These terminal locations are strategically located to concentrate on regional freight movements generally within a 500-mile radius of the terminals. This allows us to meet the needs of our customers in those regions while allowing our drivers to primarily stay within an operating region which provides them with more “home time.” This also allows us opportunities to service and maintain revenue equipment across all subsidiaries, at our facilities on a frequent basis.
Personnel at the individual terminal locations manage these operations based on the overall corporate operating and maintenance goals and objectives. Our CODM evaluates the operational efficiencies of the Company's transportation services and operating performance of terminals on a combined basis based on consolidated operating ratio and reports detailing all of the Company’s load movements, rate per mile, and non-revenue miles. Our reporting units operate centralized computer networks within their respective operations and regular communication to achieve enterprise-wide load coordination. We are actively working to better integrate computer networks across reporting units.
We emphasize customer satisfaction through on-time performance, dependable late-model equipment, and consistent equipment availability to meet the volume requirements of our customers. We also maintain a trailer to tractor ratio that allows us to position trailers at customer locations for convenient loading and unloading. The freight we transport is predominately non-perishable and does not require driver handling. These factors help minimize waiting time, which increases tractor utilization and promotes driver retention.
Customers, Marketing, Safety and Diversity
We seek to transport freight that will complement traffic in our existing service areas and remain consistent with our focus on short-to-medium haul, regional distribution markets, and cross-border freight to and from Mexico. Management believes that building lane density in our primary traffic lanes will minimize empty miles and enhance driver “home time.”
We target customers with multiple, time-sensitive shipments, including those utilizing “just-in-time” manufacturing and inventory management. In seeking these customers, we have positioned our business as a provider of premium service at 
compensatory rates, rather than competing solely on the basis of price. We believe our reputation for quality service, reliable equipment, and equipment availability makes us a core carrier for many of our customers. This past year we once again were recognized for customer service by several of our customers as a testament to our service standards. These awards include:
•FedEx Express Core Carrier of the Year (12 years in a row)
•FedEx Express Platinum Service Level Award (99.98% On-Time Delivery)
•Home Depot Carrier of the Year (CFI)
•United Sugars Carrier of the Year 
•Schneider Logistics Carrier of the Year
•Transplace National Truckload Carrier of the Year
•DHL Truckload Carrier of the Year
During 2022, we were also recognized with the following environmental, operational, safety, and community service awards:
•Newsweek's "America's Most Trustworthy Companies" (#18-Transport, Logistics, and Packaging)
•Top Company for Women to Work for in Transportation (CFI)
•Logistics Management Quest for Quality Award (18 out of the last 20 years)
•Commercial Carrier Journal Top 250 Award
•Wreaths Across America Honor Fleet
These awards are hard-earned and are a direct reflection upon our outstanding group of employees and our focus on excellence in all areas of our business.
Our primary customers include retailers, manufacturers and parcel carriers. Our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers accounted for approximately 61%, 41%, and 27% of our operating revenues, respectively, in 2022. Further diversification of customers was the result of the Smith Transport and CFI acquisitions in 2022. During 2021, our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers were approximately 75%, 52%, and 36%, of our operating revenues respectively. Our broad capacity network and customer base has allowed us to remain appropriately diversified as no customer accounted for more than 10% of our operating revenues in 2022. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our operating revenues in 2021 at 10.0%, while no customer accounted for more than 10% of our 2020 operating revenues.
Environmental and Sustainability
We have adopted an "Environmental and Sustainability Mission". This document portrays our commitment to the environment and sustainability through our long track record of successful business practices. Through equipment designs, equipment replacement strategies, idle reduction techniques, solar energy and battery usage, and practices at each of our terminals, we are focused on reducing waste and conserving energy. Heartland's sustainability efforts are endorsed and overseen by senior management throughout the Company. Our efforts have been recognized by the US EPA SmartWay Excellence Award in seven of the last nine years of award consideration.
Human Rights
We have adopted a "Human Rights Mission". This document portrays our commitment to human rights through diversity and inclusion, workplace safety and health, and prohibitions on forced labor and human trafficking. Heartland's human rights efforts are endorsed and overseen by senior management throughout the Company. The Company is a sponsor of the organization, “Truckers Against Trafficking” (TAT). TAT exists to educate, equip, empower and mobilize members of the trucking, bus and energy industries to combat human trafficking.
Seasonality
We operate in a cyclical industry, within any given year there is also seasonality to typical freight patterns. Our tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue can also be affected by bad weather, holidays, and the number of business days that occur during a given period, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling in extreme weather conditions, while harsh weather creates higher accident frequency, increased claims, and more equipment repairs. In addition, many of our customers, particularly those in the retail industry where we have a large presence, demand additional capacity during the fourth quarter, which limits our ability to take advantage of more attractive market rates that generally exist during such periods. Recently, the duration of this increased period of demand in the fourth quarter has shortened, with certain customers requiring the same 
volume of shipments over a more condensed timeframe, resulting in increased stress and demand on our network, people, and systems. If this trend continues, it could make satisfying our customers and maintaining the quality of our service during the fourth quarter increasingly difficult. We may also suffer from natural disasters and weather-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, and fires, which may increase in frequency and severity due to climate change, as well as other man-made disasters. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers.
Drivers, Independent Contractors, and Other Employees
We rely on our workforce in achieving our business objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we employed an average of approximately 4,710 people compared to approximately 3,180 people during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of the end of February 2023 we employed approximately 6,500 employees. The increase in employees as of December 31, 2022 was predominantly due to the acquisitions of Smith Transport and CFI in May and August, respectively. We also contracted with independent contractors to provide and operate tractors which provides us additional revenue equipment capacity, although not material to our operations. Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and highway use taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, independent contractors accounted for approximately 2.7% and 0.7% of our total miles, respectively. The increase in independent contractor miles is due to the CFI acquisition. We also utilize third party carriers to facilitate our Mexico logistics operations, following the CFI acquisition. These expenses are presented as rent and purchased transportation costs.
The trucking industry has been faced with a qualified driver shortage. During 2021, increased freight demand, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, intensified an already challenging qualified driver market. Competition for qualified drivers continued to be challenging in 2022 and is expected to be a challenge going forward due to the decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in our industry. However, driver availability began to change late in 2022 and to date in 2023, as a result of the changing freight and economic environments and we believe certain drivers have moved from smaller less financially stable carriers to more financially stable carriers and from independent contractors to company drivers. Although there has been some increased movement of drivers between companies in our industry, the issue of decreasing amount of qualified CDL drivers in our industry continues. We continually explore new strategies to attract and retain qualified drivers with changes in market conditions and demands. We hire the majority of our drivers with at least six months of over-the-road experience and safe driving records. As discussed below, the Company's driver training program provides an additional source of future potential professional drivers. In order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service, we have sought to solidify our position as an industry leader in driver compensation in our operating markets and for the services we provide. We have increased wages and enhanced the compensation for our drivers multiple times in the last three years. Further, we have continued to get more creative in providing better pay, benefits, equipment, and facilities for our drivers. Our comprehensive driver compensation and benefits program rewards drivers for years of service and safe operating mileage benchmarks, which are critical to our operational and financial performance. Certain driver pay packages include minimum pay protection provisions, future pay increases based on years of continued service with us, increased rates for accident-free miles of operation, detention pay, and other pay programs to assist drivers with unproductive time associated with circumstances outside of their control, such as inclement weather, equipment breakdowns, and customer issues. We believe that our driver compensation and benefits package is consistently among the best in the industry. We are committed to investing in our drivers and compensating them for safety as both are key to our operational and financial performance.
In response to the driver shortage in our industry, the Company continues to evaluate and pursue the expansion of driver training schools. Millis Transfer has operated a driver training school program, Millis Training Institute, since 1989. Millis Training Institute is a driver training program dedicated to identifying, training, and developing capable individuals into obtaining their commercial driving license and becoming professional truck drivers. This driver training program currently provides a source of qualified professional drivers for our Company. The driver training program offers an additional opportunity to hire professional drivers other than the traditional approach of hiring only experienced over-the-road drivers. During 2022, we rolled out the first Heartland Training Institute location in Phoenix, Arizona, modeled after the successful program in place at Millis Transfer. We will continue to evaluate this training program for future expansion. Further, CFI has partnered with training facilities as a source of driver trainees, but does not operate a driver training school program.
We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Driver Compensation
Our comprehensive driver compensation program rewards drivers for years of service and safe operating mileage benchmarks, which are critical to our operational and financial performance. Our driver pay package generally includes weekly base pay minimums for mileage based drivers, future pay increases based on years of continued service with us, increased rates for 
accident-free miles of operation, detention pay, and other pay programs to assist drivers with unproductive time. In addition to the scheduled pay increases based on years of continued service, we have increased the base pay package and enhanced the compensation for our drivers multiple times during the last three years. We believe that our driver compensation package, compared to others in our industry, is consistently among the best in the industry. We are committed to investing in our drivers and compensating them for safety as both are key to our operational and financial performance. We also invest a significant amount of capital in our terminal facilities as we strive to offer our driver employees up to date and convenient amenities throughout our terminal network across the country while they are away from home.
Revenue Equipment
Our industry is very capital intensive as it relates to tractors and trailers. One of our core operating goals is to maintain a modern fleet of tractor and trailer equipment. The overall performance and reliability of tractor equipment typically has increased with each new model year of tractors that we have acquired in the last 5 years. By maintaining late model year tractors, a low average age, we experience better operating performance. Our drivers, along with the Company, benefit from the latest safety technologies and features that we choose to equip our tractors with. The modern fleet appeals to new drivers and aids in the retention of current drivers. Deploying this core strategy, along with idle management and driver comfort technology, also allows us to reduce our carbon footprint. This is evidenced by us being awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay Excellence Award in seven of the last nine years of award consideration.
We have historically owned our tractors and trailers and do not lease revenue equipment, other than when we have acquired companies that have utilized leases. Historically, we have paid cash for the acquisition of new revenue equipment. These strategies allow us the flexibility to buy and sell tractors (and trailers) opportunistically to capitalize on new and used equipment markets, size our fleet to the volume of attractive freight, and manage cash tax expense. One method we use to accomplish these goals is to depreciate our new tractors (excludes assets acquired through an acquisition) for financial reporting purposes using the 125% declining balance method, in which depreciation is higher in early periods and tapers off in later periods. We believe this method more accurately reflects actual asset values and affords us the flexibility to sell tractors at most points during their life cycle without experiencing losses. In addition, the decline in depreciation during later periods is typically offset by increased repairs and maintenance expense as the tractors age, which keeps our total operating costs more uniform over the operating life of the equipment. Trailers are depreciated using the straight-line method.
Revenue equipment acquired through acquisitions is generally revalued to current market values as of the acquisition date. Assets obtained more than a year prior to the acquisition by the acquired company are depreciated on a straight-line basis aligned with the remaining period of expected use, whereas those obtained less than a year prior are depreciated consistent with newly purchased assets. As acquired equipment is replaced, our fleet returns to our base methods of declining balance depreciation for tractors and straight-line depreciation for trailers. We believe our revenue equipment strategy is sound over the long term. However, it can contribute to volatility in gain on sale of equipment and quarterly earnings per share.
At December 31, 2022, all of our operating tractor fleet was equipped with event recorders and accident avoidance technology. All over-the-road tractors are equipped with mobile communication systems that comply with the latest ELD regulations. These units are the base communication with our drivers. This technology allows for efficient communication with our drivers regarding freight and safety (e.g. weather shutdowns), as well as fueling decisions, and provides the ability to manage the needs of our customers based on real-time information on load status. Our mobile communication systems also allow us to obtain information regarding equipment for better planning and efficient maintenance time as well as information regarding driver performance and efficiency.
As of December 31, 2022 the average age of our tractor fleet was 2.0 years compared to 1.4 years at December 31, 2021. We have historically operated the majority of our tractors while under warranty to minimize repair and maintenance cost and reduce service interruptions caused by breakdowns. The average age of our trailer fleet was 6.3 years at December 31, 2022 compared to 3.4 years at December 31, 2021. The average age of our tractor and trailer fleets was impacted by the inclusion of the Smith Transport and CFI equipment obtained through our 2022 acquisitions.
We obtain a small portion of our tractor capacity through the use of independent contractors who own their own tractor equipment, although our use of independent contractors is not material to our overall operations, the portion of independent contractors has increased as a result of the CFI acquisition. Independent contractors are responsible for the maintenance of their equipment.
The "Regulation" section in this Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report discusses in detail several regulations that have impacted and could continue to affect our cost and use of revenue equipment.
Fuel
We mainly purchase diesel fuel ("fuel") over-the-road through a network of fuel stops throughout the U.S. at which we have negotiated price discounts. In addition, bulk fuel sites are maintained at twenty-five of our terminal locations. We strategically manage fuel purchase decisions based on pricing of over-the-road fuel prices, bulk fuel prices, and the routing of equipment. Both above ground and underground storage tanks are utilized at the bulk fuel sites. We believe exposure to environmental cleanup costs is minimized by periodic inspection and monitoring of the tanks. We also have insurance policies in place for the operation of our tanks located at terminal locations. Increases in fuel prices can have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations given the amount of fuel we consume. We have fuel surcharge agreements with most customers that enable us to pass through most long-term price increases. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, fuel expense was $194.6 million and $99.6 million, or 25.0% and 19.8%, respectively, of our total operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, fuel surcharge revenues were $169.2 million and $76.1 million, respectively. Department of Energy (“DOE”) average price of fuel increased 51.8% in 2022 compared to 2021, which had a corresponding negative impact on our net fuel cost, before the impacts of improved fleet efficiency, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Fuel consumed by empty and out-of-route miles and by truck engine idling time is not recoverable and therefore any increases or decreases in fuel costs related to empty and out-of-route miles and idling time will directly impact our operating results. During March 2022 DOE average fuel prices increased to over $5.00 per gallon. The DOE average fuel cost remained above this elevated threshold for the period from March through December 31, 2022, although the DOE weekly average for the last four weeks of December fell below $5.00 per gallon. The average DOE price was $4.99 for 2022, which is the highest annual average on record since tracking began in 1994. The trend of fuel prices below the $5.00 per gallon threshold has continued through the first eight weeks of 2023. While this is an improvement compared to the majority of 2022, the latest DOE diesel fuel price in February 2023 is up 6.0% compared to the same week of 2022.
Competition and Industry
The truckload industry is highly competitive and fragmented with thousands of carriers of varying sizes. We compete with other truckload carriers; primarily those serving the regional, short-to-medium haul market. Logistics providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, and private fleets provide additional competition but to a lesser extent. The industry is highly competitive based primarily upon freight rates, qualified drivers, service, and equipment availability. We specialize in time-sensitive shipments, including "just-in-time" and similar types of freight. We provide premium service at compensatory rates, rather than competing solely on the basis of price.
We operate in a cyclical industry. In early 2022, freight demand was initially strong, following an extended period of freight demand at peak levels that began in mid 2020 and continued throughout 2021 and into 2022. Freight demand began to soften in the back half of 2022. While the current levels are down compared against those unprecedented levels experienced during 2021, overall we continue to have more opportunities to haul freight than we are able to cover with our existing fleet and available drivers. We expect freight demand to remain challenged at lower demand levels in at least the first half of 2023 based upon the freight demand experienced in January and February of 2023 and expected normal seasonal trends. However, continued supply chain issues for tractors, trailers and related parts, general consumer product output and inventory volatility, consumer demand, and disruption in oil and diesel markets all could create additional volatility regarding freight demand during 2023.
We continue to focus on providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in our regional operating areas. Organic growth has become increasingly difficult for traditional over-the-road truckload carriers given a shortage of qualified drivers in the industry and availability of revenue equipment assets. We have completed two recent strategic acquisitions to combat these industry challenges. In addition, we continue to evaluate and explore different driving options and offerings for our existing and potential new drivers across our unique mix of driver offerings at Heartland Express, Millis Transfer, Smith Transport, and CFI.
The trucking industry has been faced with a qualified driver shortage. During 2021, increased freight demand, combined with lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, intensified an already challenging qualified driver market. Competition for qualified drivers continued to be challenging in the first half of 2022 as freight demand remained strong. However, driver availability began to change late in 2022 and to date in 2023, as a result of the changing freight and economic environments and we believe certain drivers have moved from smaller less financially stable carriers to more financially stable carriers. Although we expect driver availability and hiring to be a challenge going forward due to the decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in our industry. We continually explore new strategies to attract and retain qualified drivers with changes in market conditions and demands. We hire the majority of our drivers with at least three to six months of over-the-road experience and safe driving records. The Company's driver training program provides an additional source of future potential professional drivers. In order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service, we have sought to solidify our position as an industry leader in driver compensation in our operating markets and for the services we provide. We have

We believe that our driver compensation and benefits package is consistently among the best in the industry. We are committed to investing in our drivers and compensating them for safety as both are key to our operational and financial performance.
Safety and Risk Management
Our safety program is designed to minimize accidents and to conduct our business within governmental safety regulations. We communicate safety issues with drivers on a regular basis and also emphasize safety through equipment specifications and regularly scheduled maintenance intervals. Our drivers are compensated and recognized for achieving and maintaining a safe driving record.
The primary risks associated with our business include cargo loss and physical damage, personal injury, property damage, and workers’ compensation claims. We self-insure a portion of the exposure related to all of the aforementioned risks. Insurance coverage, including self-insurance retention levels, is evaluated on an annual basis. We actively participate in the settlement of each claim incurred.
We act as a self-insurer for auto liability, defined as including property damage, personal injury, or cargo. For Heartland Express, Millis Transfer and CFI insurance coverage has retention of $2.0 million for any individual claim based on the insured party, accident date, and circumstances of the loss event. There is an additional $1.0 million aggregate self-insurance corridor for claims between $2.0 million and $3.0 million. Liabilities in excess of these deductibles are covered by insurance up to $60.0 million including retention of 50% of exposure from $5.0 million to $10.0 million. We retain any liability in excess of $60.0 million. Smith Transport has the same insurance coverage except with a lower retention of $0.5 million for any individual claim. We act as a self-insurer for workers’ compensation based on defined insurance retention of $1.0 million. We act as a self-insurer for property damage to our tractors and trailers. We maintain a general insurance coverage policy for our terminal facilities with a $0.25 million deductible.
Regulation
Transportation Regulations
We are a common and contract motor carrier regulated by the DOT and various state and local agencies. We operate under DOT authorities respective to our four individual operating brands. The DOT generally governs matters such as safety requirements, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, insurance requirements, and periodic financial reporting. Our Company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and HOS. Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to U.S. regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers' HOS, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers.
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver HOS. Changes to such HOS rules can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our drivers may operate and/or disrupting our network. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers’ maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours. In June 2020, the FMCSA adopted a final rule substantially as proposed, which became effective in September 2020. Certain industry groups have challenged these rules in court, and while the FMCSA's final rule has been upheld, it remains unclear if industry or other groups will bring additional challenges against the FMCSA's final rule. Since that time, we have seen a slight increase in the productivity of our drivers. Any future changes to HOS rules could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.
There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. We currently have a 
satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, for each of our respective DOT authorities, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we received a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of "satisfactory," "conditional," and "unsatisfactory" would be replaced with a single safety rating of "unfit." Thus, a carrier with no rating would be deemed fit. Moreover, data from roadside inspections and the results of all investigations would be used to determine a carrier’s fitness on an ongoing basis. This would replace the current methodology of determining a carrier’s fitness based solely on infrequent comprehensive onsite reviews. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”) scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented. Additionally, the FMCSA is conducting a study on the causation of large-truck crashes, which is expected to gather data through 2024. Although it remains unclear whether such study will ultimately be completed, the results of such study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regards to safety and fitness.
In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Generally, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, (iii) subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, (iv) cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores or (v) increase our insurance costs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Under CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. We will continue to monitor our CSA scores and compliance through results from roadside inspections and other data available to detect positive or negative trends in compliance issues on an ongoing basis. A study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. In June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if, when and to what extent such changes to the CSA program will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
In May 2020 the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a crash in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier’s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program (“CPDP”). The CPDP expands the types of eligible crashes, modify the Safety Measurement System to exclude crashes with not preventable determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the not preventable determinations in the Pre-Employment Screening Program. Under the program, carriers with eligible crashes that occurred on or after August 2019, may submit a Request for Data Review with the required police accident report and other supporting documents, photos or videos through the FMCSA’s DataQs website. If the FMCSA determines the crash was not preventable, it will be listed on the Safety Measurement System but not included when calculating a carrier’s Crash Indicator Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Category measure in SMS. Additionally, any determinations of not preventable crashes will be noted on a driver’s Pre-Employment Screening Program report.
The FMCSA published a final rule in December 2015 that required the use of ELDs or automatic onboard recording devices (“AOBRs”) by nearly all carriers by December 2017 (the "2015 ELD Rule"). The use of AOBRs was permitted until December 2019, at which time the use of ELDs was required. We were compliant with both aspects of the 2015 ELD Rule within the 
requisite deadlines. We believe that more effective HOS enforcement under the 2015 ELD Rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to HOS requirements and may further reduce industry capacity.
In December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requiring motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements. Motor carriers are required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations that prohibit them from operating commercial motor vehicles. The final rule became effective in January 2017, with a compliance date in January 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver’s licensing agencies to comply with certain Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver’s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading, or transferring to a CDL. This new action allowed states’ compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. That being said, the FMCSA indicated it would allow states the option to voluntarily query Clearinghouse information beginning January 2020. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule, however. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market. Pursuant to a new rule finalized by the FMCSA, beginning in November 2024, states will be required to query the Clearinghouse when issuing, renewing, transferring, or upgrading a commercial driver's license and must revoke a driver's commercial driving privileges if such driver is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for one or more drug or alcohol violations.
In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral fluid test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. The proposal specifically requires that the second test be done simultaneously at the collection event or when directed by the medical review officer after review and verification of laboratory-reported results for the hair specimen. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in two prior court cases. In 2022, an industry group known as the Trucking Alliance sought an exemption from the FMCSA that would allow positive hair specimen tests to be uploaded into the FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. This request was denied by the FMCSA, however, noting they cannot act until the DHHS finalizes these guidelines. Additionally, in February 2022 the DOT issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would include oral fluid testing as an alternative to urine testing for purposes of the DOT’s drug testing program, with a goal of improving the integrity and effectiveness of the drug testing program, along with potential cost savings to regulated parties. Public comment on the proposed rule closed in April 2022, with industry participants generally being in favor. It is unclear if, and when, a final rule may be put in place, however. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers. We currently perform urine testing but are testing and monitoring the use of hair specimen testing at one of our subsidiaries. Finally, federal drug regulators have announced a proposal to add fentanyl to a drug testing panel that would detect the use of such drug among safety-sensitive federal employees, which would include truck drivers if adopted by the DOT. If the proposal is accepted, DHHS expects to add fentanyl to the testing panel as early as the first quarter of 2023. 
Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including: (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking certain endorsements, including a hazardous materials endorsement, known as the Entry-Level Driver Training regulations (the "ELDT Regulations"), which was made final in December 2016, with an initial compliance date in February 2020. However, in May 2020, the FMCSA approved an interim rule delaying implementation of the ELDT Regulations by two years, which extended the compliance date until February 2022. The ELDT Regulations, among other things, unify driver training curriculum nationwide by mandating certain theory and behind-the-wheel training standards prior to taking the skills test, and require commercial driving schools and other training programs (including ours) to implement such curriculum and register with the FMCSA’s Training Provider Registry, certifying that their curriculum meets the new standards. The rules generally do not apply retroactively, however, so current holders of commercial driver’s licenses will largely be unaffected. That being said, these rules could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations. They may also result in an increase in the time and expense required to operate or expand our driver training schools and programs, which could adversely affect our results and profitability. In February 2023, the FMCSA issued a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requesting additional information on automated driving systems (“ADS”) and seeking comment on regulatory approaches that would enable it to obtain relevant safety information and the current and anticipated size of the population of carriers operating ADS-equipped commercial motor vehicles. Public comment on the supplemental notice will remain open until March 2023, and it remains to be seen, what, if any, final rules will stem therefrom. Additionally, the FMCSA in conjunction with the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration ("NHTSA"), have announced their intention to propose a rule for performance standards and maintenance requirements for automatic emergency braking on heavy trucks. Such proposal is anticipated as early as March 2023, but it remains uncertain what exactly it may require, and whether a final rule will ultimately be put into place.
Our industry is also subject to a number of recently proposed rules which mandate the use of speed-limiting devices in certain commercial motor vehicles. In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. In May 2021, however, the Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act was reintroduced into the U.S. House of Representatives and would require commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiter that would limit the vehicle’s speed to no more than 65 M.P.H. Furthermore, in April 2022, the FMCSA issued a notice of intent to propose a rule during 2023 that will require certain commercial vehicles to be equipped with speed limiters. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
Among other things, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), signed into law by President Biden in November 2021, created an apprenticeship program for drivers aged 18 to 20 years old to eventually qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. The provision drew certain mechanics from the bills introduced in Congress in 2019 related to lowering the age requirements for interstate commercial driving. The FMCSA announced the establishment of this apprenticeship program in January 2022 in an effort to begin to help the industry’s ongoing driver shortage. This program, known as the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program, is open to 18 to 20-year-old drivers who already hold intrastate commercial driver's licenses and sets a strict training regimen for participating drivers and carriers to comply with. Motor carriers interested in participating must complete an application for participation and submit monthly data on an apprentice’s driver activity, safety outcomes, and additional supporting information. The Safe Driver Pilot Apprenticeship Program is limited to 3,000 driver-apprentices at any given time, with new driver-apprentices allowed into the program to replace those that leave or age out. It remains unclear whether any regulatory changes will stem from the apprenticeship program.
The IIJA also required that the FMCSA clarify the differences between brokers, bona fide agents, and dispatch services, and to further specify its interpretation of the definitions of “broker” and “bona fide agents.” As such, and in an attempt to rein in companies engaging in brokerage services without proper FMCSA authority, the FMCSA issued interim guidelines in November 2022, which, among other things, (i) contained a multitude of factors relevant to determining whether a dispatch service actually requires brokerage authority, (ii) clarified that operating as an unauthorized broker carries civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation, and (iii) clarified that the handling of funds in shipper-motor carrier transactions is an important consideration (pointing towards a broker designation) in the determination of whether someone is a broker or simply an agent. The FMCSA also clarified, however, that any determination will be highly fact specific and will entail determining whether the person or company is engaged in the allocation of traffic between motor carriers. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries currently hold FMCSA brokerage authority, so while the impact of this guidance remains to be seen, the Company does not currently anticipate an adverse impact on its operations. Additionally, in a January 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FMCSA proposed more oversight of truck brokers, freight forwarders, and the surety bond and trust companies that back them. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking considers regulatory modifications in five areas: (i) assets readily available, (ii) immediate suspension of broker/freight forwarder operating authority, (iii) surety or trust responsibilities, (iv) enforcement authority, and (v) entities eligible to serve as BMC-85 trustees. Among other changes, the proposal would allow brokers or freight forwarders to meet regulatory requirements to have “assets readily available” by maintaining trusts that meet certain criteria, including that they can be liquidated within seven calendar days of an event that triggers a payment from the trust. The proposal also stipulates that “available financial security” falls below $75,000 when there is a drawdown on the broker or freight forwarder’s surety bond or trust fund. Adoption of these changes could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations, operating costs, and related expenses.
In June 2022, the United States Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”) declined to review a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision involving a personal injury suit alleging that a freight broker had liability for an accident because it breached its duty to select a competent contractor to transport the load in question. In its petition to the Supreme Court, the broker unsuccessfully argued that the Ninth Circuit’s decision improperly disallowed federal pre-emption, and would expose freight brokers to a patchwork of state regulations across the United States. This development potentially calls into question freight brokers’ ability to rely on federal agency standards in selecting motor carriers, given the carrier involved in the accident was allegedly in good standing with the FMCSA when it was chosen to transport the load. It could also lead to primary (as opposed to contingent) liability being imposed upon freight brokers, and increased insurance premiums for brokerage operations generally. Although we are committed to selecting safe and secure motor carriers in carrying out our brokerage activities, if we are found to be negligent in the motor carrier selection process it could lead to significant liabilities in the event of an accident, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.
In September 2022, the FMCSA issued an advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would require fleets and owner-operators to equip their trucks with unique electronic identification systems designed to streamline roadside inspections and provide transparency and accountability in day-to-day trucking operations. The petition was generally disfavored by transportation industry participants, citing, among other things, the petition’s failure to address privacy and data security risks. It remains to be seen what rules, if any, may stem from this notice.
In November 2022 Senate lawmakers introduced legislation that would set aside grant funds over four years to expand truck parking across the United States. Such legislation would allow for the creation of new parking areas, the expansion of existing facilities, and the approval of commercial parking at existing weigh stations, rest areas, and park-and-ride facilities. It would also allow for truck parking expansion at commercial truck stops and travel plazas. Industry groups are generally in favor of the bill, as a lack of available parking has negatively impacted the industry as a whole, including the Company and its subsidiaries.
In December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the American Trucking Association and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision. In January 2021, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FMCSA's determination that federal law does preempt California's meal and rest break laws, as applied to drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles. Other current and future state and local laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws and lawsuits have recently been filed and/or adjudicated against carriers demanding compensation for sleeper berth time, layovers, rest breaks and pre-trip and post-trip inspections, the outcome of which could have major implications for the treatment of time that drivers spend off-duty (whether in a truck’s sleeper berth or otherwise) under applicable wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Company and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we, along with other companies in the industry, could become subject to an uneven patchwork of laws throughout the United States. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to preempt certain state and local laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire network or overhaul our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.
Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers' compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to heighten the penalties of companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees' overtime and/or wage requirements. The most recent example being the Protecting the Rights to Organize ("PRO") Act, which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and received by the Senate in March 2021 and remains with the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The PRO Act proposes to apply the "ABC Test" for classifying workers under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act claims. Additionally, in October 2022, the Department of Labor proposed a new rule regarding independent contractor classification, which if adopted, would evaluate an employer's relationship with workers under six categories to determine whether such worker should be classified as an independent contractor based on a totality of the circumstances and the economic realities of such relationship. It is unknown whether any of the proposed legislation will become law or whether any industry-based exemptions from any resulting law will be granted. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with these initiatives. 
Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 (“AB5”), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged “ABC Test” must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee, and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all three of the following criteria:
•the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; and
•the worker is performing work outside the usual course of business of the hiring company; and
•the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.
How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, however, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 2018. While AB5 was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (“CTA”) went forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the reasoning behind the injunction in April 2021, ruling that AB5 is not pre-empted by federal law, but granted a stay of the AB5 mandate in June 2021 (preventing its application and temporarily continuing the injunction) while the CTA petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision. In November 2021, the Supreme Court requested that the U.S. solicitor general weigh in on the case. The injunction remained in place until the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. As a result, the injunction was lifted and retroactively placed AB5 into law as of January 2020. While the stay of the AB5 mandate provided temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, the CTA and other industry groups are continuing to bring challenges against AB5 and it remains unclear whether the CTA or other industry groups will ultimately be successful in receiving future injunctions or in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. In addition, companies that utilize lease-purchase independent contractor programs have been more susceptible to reclassification lawsuits and several recent decisions have been made in favor of those seeking to classify as employees certain independent contractors that participated in lease-purchase programs. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. Our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. While we have been successful in continuing to classify our independent contractor drivers as independent contractors and not employees, we may be unsuccessful in defending that position in the future. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Independent contractors currently represent a small portion of our fleet.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. Our truck terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain facilities have waste oil, new oil, diesel exhaust fluid ("DEF"), or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. We do not know of any environmental regulations that would have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on us. We maintain a young fleet age of tractors to ensure we are using the most up-to-date technology deployed by manufacturers to reduce emissions. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.
In August 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors we employ (the "Phase 1 Standards"). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the "Phase 2 Standards"). In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. The final rule was effective in December 2016, but has since faced challenges and delays. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and 
pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposal is still undetermined. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In November 2021, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the association challenging the standards and vacated all portions of the Phase 2 Standards that applied to trailers, and consequently, the Phase 2 Standards will only require reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for tractors. The Company’s (or its subsidiaries', as applicable) new tractor purchases in 2022 complied with the emission and fuel consumption reductions required by the Phase 2 Standards. Even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards have been removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards (described in further detail below).
In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. In March 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule that included nitrogen oxide emission standards which are more stringent than the Phase 2 Standards for certain heavy-duty motor vehicles. In December 2022, the EPA adopted a final rule that reflected a compromise of the options previously proposed, with new emissions standards of nitrogen oxides for heavy-duty motor vehicles beginning with model year 2027 being more than 80% stronger than current emission standards, with the intent to reduce heavy-duty emissions by almost 50% from today’s levels by 2045. The EPA has indicated that the December 2022 rule is the first part of a multi part plan focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, which is commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” or the “Clean Trucks Plan.” The EPA has indicated that it plans to release proposals for the remaining steps in the Clean Trucks Plan by the end of March 2023 and is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect. The EPA has also previously indicated it is working on enacting additional, more stringent, greenhouse gas emission standards (beginning with model year 2030 vehicles) by the end of 2024. Compliance with these regulations could increase the cost of new tractors and trailers, impair equipment productivity, and increase operating expenses. These effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the operating results that will be produced by the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.
The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") also adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling, resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for model year 2011 equipment began in January 2010 and have been phased in over several years for older equipment. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that would generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. Thus, even though the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards were removed, we will still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards, which may result in increased equipment costs and could adversely affect our operating results and profitability. CARB has also recently announced intentions to adopt regulations ensuring that 100% of tractors operating in California are operating with battery or fuel cell-electric engines in the future. Whether these regulations will ultimately be adopted remains unclear. Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed a variety of other climate-change proposals, including those that contemplate regulatory limits on carbon emissions and fuel consumption. Compliance with such regulations could increase the cost of new tractors and trailers, impair equipment productivity, and increase operating expenses. These effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the operating results that will be produced by the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. In June 2020 CARB also passed the Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) regulation, which became effective in March 2021 and generally requires original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production and sales of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. The most aggressive ACT standards apply to Class 4-8 trucks, which range from 14,000-33,000 pounds, by requiring that 9% of such trucks be zero emission beginning in 2024 and increasing to 75% by 2035. Similar (albeit lower) increasing zero emission requirements apply to Class 2b-3 trucks, and Class 7-8 trucks between 2024 and 2035. Among other impacts, ACT could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors. It has also led to similar legislation in other states, with Oregon, Washington, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts already adopting ACT, and a number of other states either considering adoption of ACT or affirmatively conducting a preliminary rulemaking process to that effect. CARB is also in the process of considering and finalizing what is known as the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, also aimed at transitioning to zero emission vehicles beginning in 2024. ACF is a purchase requirement for medium and heavy-duty fleets to adopt an increasing percentage of zero emission trucks, designed to complement the sell-side obligations of ACT. The proposed ACF regulations, generally set to begin in January 2024, apply to three categories of fleet operators: (1) high priority fleets who meet certain thresholds of trucks or revenue (including fleets that operate 50 or more trucks, or generate $50 million or more in gross annual revenue), (2) drayage fleets, and (3) state and local government public fleets. For high priority fleets who meet the applicable thresholds, compliance can be achieved by either (i) ensuring that all new vehicles added to the fleet be zero emission, and removing older vehicles once their statutory useful life is reached, or (ii) meeting certain fleet composition requirements (e.g., percentage of zero 
emission vehicles in the fleet) by certain dates, with the percentage of zero emission vehicles increasing over time, and resulting in 100% zero emission fleets by 2042 (or earlier for certain classes of vehicles). As with ACT, adoption and implementation of ACF could materially and negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations, operating costs, and related expenses.
In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity or increase in driver turnover.
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (the "FSMA"). This rule sets forth requirements related to (i) the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food, (ii) the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety, (iii) the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices, and (iv) maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements, and training related to the foregoing items. These requirements took effect for larger carriers in April 2017 and are applicable when performing as a carrier or as a broker. We believe we are in compliance with these requirements. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
As the FDA continues its efforts to modernize food safety, it is likely additional food safety regulations will take effect in the future. In July 2020, the FDA released its “New Era of Smarter Food Safety” blueprint, which creates a ten year roadmap to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. This blueprint builds on the work done under the FSMA, and while it is still unclear what, if any, changes to the current governing framework may ultimately take effect, further regulation in this area could negatively affect our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses going forward.
Executive and Legislative Climate
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by President Biden. Amongst other considerations, the Inflation Reduction Act contains provisions relating to energy, climate change, and tax reform. In particular, the Inflation Reduction Act shifts timing for certain tax payments, imposes an excise tax on certain corporate stock buybacks, and creates a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax, which is generally applicable to corporations that reported over $1 billion in profits in each of the three proceeding tax years. Tax changes in the Inflation Reduction Act, together with changes to any other U.S. tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability. It is unclear what other legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo. However, adoption and implementation could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses.
The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) was entered into effect in July 2020. The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of freight we transport.
The IIJA was signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. The roughly $1.2 trillion bill contains an estimated $550 billion in new spending, which will impact transportation. In particular, it dedicates more than $100 billion for surface transportation networks and roughly $66 billion for freight and passenger rail operations. Provisions in the law specific to trucking are discussed above. It otherwise remains unclear how the IIJA will be implemented into and effect our industry in the long-term. The IIJA may result in increased compliance and implementation related expenses, which could have a negative impact on our operations. 
In January 2023, the Safer Highways and Increased Performance for Interstate Trucking Act (the “SHIP IT Act”) was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives. As proposed, the SHIP IT Act would allow states to issue special permits for overweight vehicles and loads during emergencies, allow drivers to apply for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act grants, attempt to recruit truck drivers to the industry through targeted and temporary tax credits, streamline the CDL process in certain respects, and expand access to truck parking and rest areas for commercial drivers. It remains unclear whether the SHIP IT Act will ultimately become law, however, and what changes it may undergo prior finalization. 
Given COVID-19’s considerable effect on our nation and industry, the FMCSA previously issued and/or extended various temporary responsive measures in response to COVID-19 pandemic. However, as additional tools, protective equipment, policies, practices, and medicines have been developed in response to COVID-19, in October 2022, the FMCSA ended the hours of service waiver previously issued with respect to certain types of shipments, such as, livestock, medical supplies, vaccines, groceries, and diesel fuel. Although to date these response measures have largely been enacted in order to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances, any further responsive measures or the lapsing of temporary measures previously enacted, remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations.
In November 2021 the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) published an emergency temporary standard (the “Emergency Rule”) requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require any employees who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work. The Emergency Rule has been blocked by the Supreme Court. This Emergency Rule was subsequently withdrawn by OSHA in January 2022. However, any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that are allowed to go into effect, could, among other things, (i) cause our unvaccinated employees to go to smaller employers, if such employers are not subject to future mandates, or leave us or the trucking industry, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (ii) result in logistical issues, increased expenses, and operational issues from arranging for weekly tests of our unvaccinated employees, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (iii) result in increased costs for recruiting and retention of drivers, as well as the cost of weekly testing, and (iv) result in decreased revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain drivers. Any future vaccination, testing or mask mandates that apply to drivers would significantly reduce the pool of drivers available to us and our industry, which could further impact the ongoing extreme shortage of available drivers. Accordingly, any vaccination, testing or mask mandates, if allowed to go into effect, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
