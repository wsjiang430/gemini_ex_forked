ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
V2X, Inc. (V2X or the Company), an Indiana Corporation, formerly known as Vectrus, Inc. (Vectrus), is a leading provider of critical mission solutions primarily to defense clients in 343 locations and 45 countries and territories worldwide. Our global footprint and ability to deliver full lifecycle converged solutions across the world enables us to support the success of our clients' missions rapidly and with precision. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 15,400 employees and 6,500 subcontract personnel. V2X offers clients around the world a broad suite of technology and services capabilities to support readiness and modernization initiatives. The Company delivers a comprehensive set of integrated solutions and critical service offerings across the operations and logistics, aerospace, training and technology markets to national security, defense, civilian and international clients.
Vectrus was incorporated in the State of Indiana in February 2014. On September 27, 2014, Exelis Inc, an Indiana corporation, spun-off (the Spin-off) Vectrus and Vectrus became an independent, publicly traded company. References herein to "Exelis" or "Former Parent" refer to Exelis Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than Vectrus). Exelis was acquired by a predecessor entity of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. in May 2015. 
On July 5, 2022 (the Closing Date), Vectrus completed its merger (Merger) with Vertex Aerospace Services Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (Vertex), thereby forming V2X. The fair value of the consideration transferred with respect to the Merger totaled $634.0 million as of the Closing Date. For a description of the Merger, see Note 3, Merger and Acquisitions. The Merger created a larger and more diversified company with the ability to compete for more integrated business opportunities and generate revenue across geographies, clients, and contract-types. We continue to operate under one reportable business segment post-Merger.
Unless the context otherwise requires or unless stated otherwise, references to "V2X", "we," "us," "our," “combined company”, "the Company" and "our Company" refer to V2X and all of its consolidated subsidiaries (including, subsequent to the Merger, Vertex and its consolidated subsidiaries), taken together as a whole. 
Significant Acquisitions
On December 31, 2020, we acquired Zenetex, LLC (Zenetex) and Higgins, Hermansen, Banikas, LLC (HHB). Zenetex is a leading provider of technical and strategic solutions focused on enabling mission readiness, performance, and enhanced protection for defense and national security clients globally and HHB delivers intelligence community solutions. These solutions were integrated into our existing business as additional services. The purchase prices for the Zenetex and HHB acquisitions of $117.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively, were funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Our Business Strategies
Our strategy is designed to deliver growth by providing converged solutions that fuse the digital and physical aspects of our clients' missions. This strategy also supports our goal to be a leader in the operational segment of the broader Federal services market. Our mission focus, innovation, and technology insertion into converged environments allow us to differentiate, drive value and expand client satisfaction across all geographies and client sets.
We seek to drive growth and deliver value through our strategic framework, which consists of the following strategies: Expand the Base, Capture New Markets, Deliver with Excellence, and Enhance Culture. Key components of these strategies, and our progress in executing these strategies, include:
•Expand the Base. We strive to enhance our business by strengthening our methods and approaches to deliver higher value, high-impact services to our clients, while growing our strong foundation in our core capabilities across the mission lifecycle. The expansion of scope on existing business, execution of our solution sell-through model, and client engagement initiatives are key components of this strategy.
•Capture New Markets. We are focused on creating a higher-value, technology-enabled and differentiated platform by strengthening our technology competencies and fusing the physical and digital aspects of our clients' missions. This strategy focuses on capturing new markets, organically and inorganically, introducing new clients, new capabilities, and new products / solutions, as well as international client expansion and targeted growth campaigns that leverage our strong foundation in aerospace solutions, advanced technology, and global mission training and sustainment. Additionally, we plan to build off of V2X’s enhanced capability set that includes rapid prototyping, platform modernization, 5G, predictive maintenance, software development, cyber asset hardening, and virtual reality training solutions to access new business opportunities, funding streams, and markets that are expected to drive incremental growth. 
•Deliver with Excellence. Our initiatives focused on delivery excellence are designed to improve client relationships and improve business performance. As part of this strategy, we are standardizing, improving,

and automating our core operational capabilities through enterprise systems excellence, as well as technology insertion and enablement. For example, we are leveraging our enhanced scale and footprint to further enable global supply chain as a core competency. This core competency is expected to drive efficiencies to both external clients and our core internal operations. Additionally, we incorporate continuous improvement and delivery excellence processes throughout all aspects of our business. Our initiatives, processes, and technology within Delivery Excellence also integrate into our Expand the Base, Capture New Markets, and Enhance Culture strategies, which further drives value creation and differentiation. 
•Enhance Culture. Our culture is foundational in our ability to connect people, technology, and capabilities globally across the mission lifecycle. Our ethical culture and people serve as the foundation for providing long-term value to our stakeholders. We strive to support our people to ensure they can bring their best selves to work. We will continue to build and leverage an inclusive business environment by developing leadership competency, increasing employee engagement, and building organizational capacity. For details on how we are striving to enhance our culture, see our Human Capital Management disclosure.

Customers
Our strong relationship with the Department of Defense (DoD) is attributable to our dedication to program performance, global responsiveness and operational excellence, as well as to the execution of our core values of integrity, respect, responsibility and professionalism. We treat sales to our U.S. government customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed.

Competition
Our competition varies depending on our service offerings. Our principal competitors in Aerospace Solutions include Amentum, IAP Worldwide Services, AAR, M-1 Support Services, Jacobs Technology, Marvin Engineering, divisions of Leidos Holdings, divisions of Northrop Grumman Services, and Akima Logistics Services, among others. Our principal competitors in Advanced Technology include divisions of Leidos Holdings, Inc., Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Peraton, and General Dynamics (GD) Technologies Segment. Within our Global Mission Training and Sustainment service offering, we see many of the same competitors such as Amentum, Leidos, SAIC, GD in addition to KBR, Valiant Integrated Services, PULAU Corporation and Lockheed Martin, Rotary and Missions Systems Segment. There are typically fewer competitors in the overseas market for each of our services capabilities and they vary from region to region.
The U.S. government has implemented policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. From time to time, certain U.S. government work in the U.S. has been restricted to small businesses, including Alaskan native companies. We participate with these small businesses as a subcontractor for select opportunities. In addition, we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services will help us win and perform the contract. Our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs. 
Competitive bids for the work that V2X pursues are based on technical qualifications and corporate experience in performing contracts of similar size and scope and can be highly price sensitive. While not every contract is procured via selection of the lowest priced bidder, customers are sensitive to cost based on their budget allocations. Acquisition cycles are long (generally 12 to 24 months), and contracts are typically multi-year contracts that include an initial period of one-year or less with annual one-year (or less) option periods for the remaining contract period. 
Some U.S. government customers have shown a strong preference for multiple award IDIQ contracts. These contracts offer awards to a pool of contractors, followed by competition within the pool for individual programs via task orders under each IDIQ over the period of performance. The period of performance under IDIQ contracts follows a traditional three-to-ten-year performance cycle. The governing IDIQ contracts often have multi-billion-dollar ceiling values. 
We closely monitor costs to foster highly competitive pricing and use an in-house business development model both to manage the cost of revenue and capture opportunities for future bids. 
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. However, various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of awards, product deliveries, customer acceptance of products and services, contract phase-in durations, contract completions, world events and the availability of customer funding. Weather and natural phenomena can also temporarily affect the performance of our services. 
The U.S. government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. U.S. government agencies may award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. 
Regulatory Environment
The U.S. government markets in which we serve are highly regulated. When working with U.S. agencies and entities, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the creation, administration and performance of contracts. Among other things, these laws and regulations: 
•Require compliance with government standards for contract administration, accounting and management internal control systems; 
•Define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced U.S. government contracts; 
•Require certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; 
•Require us not to compete for, or to divest ourselves of, work if an organizational conflict of interest exists related to such work that cannot be appropriately mitigated; and 
•Restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data. 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various rules regarding procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, allowable costs, contract performance, contract termination and adjustment, audits, and IT system security and privacy controls. In addition, as government contractors, we are subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review our performance, cost structure, incurred costs, forward pricing rates and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards under our contracts. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, and related government business systems. 
The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new or revised contract rules and regulations at any time. To help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance training relevant to their respective positions. 
We are subject to other U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the False Claims Act. When working overseas, we must comply not only with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, but also with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. laws, including regulations relating to import-export control, foreign tax considerations, data privacy, foreign labor and environmental law, and anti-corruption. 
Contracts
U.S. government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts to a prime contractor, which may utilize one or more subcontractors. Our Company usually is a prime contractor on long-term contracts that are of a finite duration of generally between three and ten years. We were the prime contractor on contracts representing 93%, 93% and 95% of our revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In other contracts, we team with the prime contractor as a subcontractor. The U.S. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as the U.S. Congress approves further appropriations. Prior to the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, it typically begins a competitive rebidding or recompete process. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or if they change. The U.S. government is required to equitably adjust a contract for additions to or reductions in scope or other changes, including price, which it directs. 
Generally, the sales price elements for our contracts are cost-plus, cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials or firm-fixed-price. We commonly have elements of cost-plus, cost-reimbursable and firm-fixed-price contracts on a single contract. 
On a cost-plus contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract’s fee arrangement, up to funding levels predetermined by our customers. On cost-plus contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts. Most of our cost-plus contracts also contain a firm-fixed-price element. Cost-plus contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship between total allowable and target cost. 
On most of our contracts, a cost-reimbursable element captures consumable materials required for the program. Typically, these costs do not bear fees.
On a time-and-materials contract, we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials, costs and expenses at cost. For this contract type, we bear the risk that our labor costs and allocable indirect expenses are greater than the fixed hourly rate defined within the contract. 
A firm-fixed-price contract typically offers higher profit margin potential due to a greater level of risk than a cost-plus contract. On a firm-fixed-price contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined contract price. Although a firm-fixed-price contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Although the overall scope of work required under the contract may not change, profit may be adjusted as experience is gained and as efficiencies are realized or costs are incurred.
The percentage of our total revenue generated from each contract type for the periods presented was as follows: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
Contract type | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Cost-plus and cost-reimbursable | 56 | % | | 71 | % | 68 | %
Firm-fixed-price | 40 | % | | 25 | % | 29 | %
Time-and-materials | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 3 | %
Total revenue | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Backlog
For a discussion of our backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Backlog in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and visitors. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change, the nature of which is inherently unpredictable, and the timing of potential changes is uncertain. Environmental, health and safety requirements affect all of our operations, and we have established a comprehensive program that is aligned with recognized standards for environmental and safety management, to address compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and the expectations of our customers. 
Human Capital Management
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. On December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 15,400 full-time employees, an increase of 7,300 employees from December 31, 2021 primarily due to the Merger. We also utilized approximately 6,500 subcontract workers, which remained substantially unchanged from the prior year. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 35% of our employees were represented by 54 collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. In the ordinary course of business, a number of collective bargaining agreements will be subject to renegotiation in a given year. We do not expect that any of the contracts subject to renegotiation in 2023 (individually or as a whole) present a significant risk to our business. We believe that relations with our employees and union representatives are positive.
We continue making significant investments in attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization to help understand and resolve barriers to retention. 
V2X routinely conducts annual employee engagement surveys. The results of those surveys are anonymized and shared with V2X employees and with management. Additionally, the results of the surveys are scored to form a benchmark 
against which the results of future surveys will be evaluated. In 2022, V2X engaged our larger, and recently merged, global workforce through structured surveys using a third-party platform to better understand concerns and expectations regarding Ethics, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I). Responses to the 2022 employee engagement surveys indicated that V2X employees generally find the company culture to be inclusive, a great place to work, and that managers’ behaviors were consistent with the V2X Code of Conduct.
Employment Benefits
We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry. Our employment benefits program includes a comprehensive benefits package, such as:
•flexible work options;
•education benefits, including tuition reimbursement program to select employees;
•wellness program;
•paid parental leave program;
•employee assistance program; and
•retirement savings plan.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
V2X’s DE&I philosophy calls for the intentional recruitment, retention, and growth of a diverse workforce, which includes employees, contractors, and Other Country National (OCN) staffing. In 2022, V2X renewed its certification to the International Stability Operations Association’s Women, Peace and Security Program for fiscal years 2023 through 2024. The DE&I Executive Council hosted over 150 V2X women leaders in the Middle East and Europe for a one-day professional and personal development networking event. The event highlights also included stories of women leaders who contribute every day to the success of V2X.
Our DE&I Executive Council, composed of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior leaders that sponsor our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), oversee our DE&I strategy and philosophy against our business practices. Our five ERGs are: Allies of Pride, Diverse Abilities, People of Color, Women at V2X and V2X Veterans.
In 2022, our five ERGs developed goals in three focus areas to foster awareness, respect, and inclusion:
•Business development and outreach;
•Employee engagement and retention and professional development; and
•Recruitment.
Annually, ERGs evaluate their performance against these goals and report them to the DE&I Executive Council, which in turn reports at least annually to our Board of Directors.
We are a leading employer of veterans and veteran spouses with more than 42% of our U.S employees voluntarily reporting a military background, and we have been recognized numerous times in recent years by veteran-focused organizations as a military-friendly employer, including recently by the National Organization on Disability as a Leading Disability Employer, by the Military Friendly Company as a Top 10 Diversity Supplier and as a Top 10 Military Spouse Employer, and by the Military Times as a Best for Vets Employer.
In 2022, the Company published its inaugural DE&I Annual Report. The report shares the Company’s diversity strategies, practices, policies and programs from across the business and includes our U.S. employee demographics for 2021.
Learning and Development
We provide learning and development opportunities to our employees to support a successful career at V2X. Our on-line V2X University gives employees access to more than 2,000 virtual courses that address such topics as leadership/management and information technology skills, along with the standard required compliance courses required for a defense contractor company. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of leaders by providing knowledge to help early-in-career employees develop the skills needed to advance within the organization. We also provide training programs to keep our supervisors current on best practices and ensure they focus on the success of their people. Also, we offer additional development opportunities to select employees to attend training and mentoring sessions.
Developing talent and ensuring a pipeline to leadership is a priority for the Company. To that end, the Company has a robust talent and succession planning process and has established a specialized program to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles. We conduct periodic reviews of succession plans and the individual development plans of our emerging talent. These sessions focus on high potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical roles, 
and are led by our Vice President and Chief Growth & Client Service Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, and Senior Vice Presidents.
We periodically hold senior leadership development events to continually develop leadership and management skills. In November 2022, we held our Leading into 2023 conference to bring together our leaders from both legacy companies to collaborate on the future of V2X.
Health and Safety
Our health and safety management system aligns with the ISO 45001 standard and includes the following elements:
•Setting annual program-level goals and objectives;
•Monitoring relevant legal and customer-specific requirements;
•Providing training to employees and contractors on health and safety provisions;
•Assessing environmental, health, and safety risks company-wide;
•Engaging with the workforce to identify health and safety risks and opportunities; and
•Conducting internal audits to evaluate compliance with the employee health and safety (EHS) Plan, legal and other requirements, and best practices. 
We track workforce safety metrics including Total Recordable Incident Rate, Days Away Restricted or Transferred Rate as well as Near Miss Frequency Rate. We initiated annual reporting of these metrics in 2021. Our robust EHS program promotes a safe and healthy workplace for all employees and subcontractors. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented public health and safety protocols in compliance with government agencies, health authorities and customer requirements. We continued to educate and keep the workforce informed on how to deploy the infectious disease response plan at the local level. In the third quarter of 2022, we conducted a review of our pandemic response actions, and lessons learned during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in workplace standards and regulations and are working toward updating our Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Action processes. 
Ethics and Compliance 
All employees must adhere to the V2X Code of Conduct (COC) that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination, unethical behaviors, and unacceptable conduct. The V2X Code of Conduct, and the standards of business conduct and ethics incorporated in the Code, apply to all employees, officers, and directors of V2X. V2X requires each employee to complete Code of Conduct training annually. Our COC was updated in 2022 for the combined entity post-Merger. We also sponsored our first Annual Corporate Compliance Ethics Week Program in 2022, which was open to all V2X employees, and was designed to shine a spotlight on Corporate Ethics by highlighting our Core Values, educating employees on our “Speak Up” culture and providing best practices resources for leaders in addressing employees’ concerns. 
Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) and OCN Compliance
V2X recognizes the risks of child labor, human trafficking and modern slavery associated with its global contracting activities and is committed to complying with internationally recognized human rights provisions and prohibitions against human trafficking and modern slavery established under the FAR CTIP and the laws and regulations of the countries in which it conducts business. This commitment is codified in our COC and our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
V2X monitors its subcontractors to verify that they are maintaining compliance with CTIP and other provisions in their contracts. Additionally, V2X maintains an active CTIP Awareness campaign at each program location, to reinforce our protection of human rights and to empower all employees to confidently report suspected violations without fear of retaliation. V2X quickly investigates reported or suspected CTIP violations, which if verified, are reported immediately to our Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary and the appropriate United States Government (USG) and program authorities.
V2X requires that corrective actions (CA) be put in place by subcontractors or employees for confirmed CTIP violations. If CTIP violations warrant, a subcontractor or employee unable to promptly execute or comply with approved CAs will be removed from the contract. V2X conducts regularly scheduled audits and inspections of employee housing and transportation, interviews employees hired through our subcontractors, and reviews employment contracts and related documentation to further validate our subcontractors' compliance with FAR 52.222-50 and both country of origin and host nation labor laws.
