Item 1. Business
Our Mission
VIZIO’s mission is to deliver immersive entertainment and compelling lifestyle enhancements that make our products the center of the connected home. 
Our Businesses
We operate two distinct but fully integrated businesses: Device and Platform+. 
Device
We offer a range of high-performance Smart TVs designed to address specific consumer preferences, as well as a portfolio of sound bars that deliver immersive audio experiences. We generate revenue from the shipment of these devices to retailers and distributors across the United States, as well as directly to consumers through our website, VIZIO.com.
Our broad Smart TV portfolio is designed to target specific consumer segments and their preferences for high picture quality, powerful processing and video performance, smart capabilities, a wide variety of content, streamlined connectivity and a stylish, modern industrial design. 
Our broad collection of high-performance sound bars delivers the home theater experience with immersive sound, powerful performance and modern designs optimized to fit the user’s room and television size. Our sound bars are voice assistant ready and include Bluetooth to allow consumers to easily pair and stream music by voice command or from their mobile device or personal computer, and every sound bar includes clear, quick-start instructions, mounting guides and common cables necessary for set-up, improving the out-of-box experience and reducing support calls. 
Platform+ 
Platform+ is comprised of SmartCast, our award-winning Smart TV operating system that enables our fully integrated entertainment solution, and Inscape, which powers our data intelligence and services. 
SmartCast delivers a compelling array of content and applications through an elegant and easy-to-use interface. It supports many of the leading streaming apps, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, discovery+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, and YouTube TV, and hosts our own free, ad-supported app, WatchFree+. SmartCast also supports Apple AirPlay 2 and Chromecast functionalities to allow users to stream additional content from their other devices to our Smart TVs. It provides broad support for third-party voice platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and Google Voice Assistant, as well as second screen viewing to offer additional interactive features and experiences. 
Inscape is our ACR technology which is able to identify the content displayed on the screen of our Smart TVs, tracking viewing data, regardless of input source. We aggregate this data to increase transparency and enhance targeting abilities for our advertisers, while adhering to our strict consumer privacy policies. The data we collect allows us to monetize our own ad inventory and provides the potential for a better user experience through more relevant advertisements and content recommendations. We also license a portion of this data to measurement companies, advertising agencies and other media and ad-tech companies. 
The VIZIO Value Proposition 
Consumers 
For consumers, we deliver a premium and interactive entertainment experience at an affordable price. We offer a large portfolio of Smart TVs and sound bars ranging in size, features and price to generate broad market appeal. Our SmartCast operating system provides many of the leading streaming apps and, by aggregating consumer viewing data, offers personalized recommendations through an easy-to-use interface. Together, our Smart TVs and SmartCast operating system create an immersive and individualized entertainment experience. 
Retailers 
For retailers, we provide quality, affordable and competitive products that attract consumers across a broad range of demographics, drawing additional consumers to these retailers and helping grow their revenue. We support these retailers with a dedicated and experienced sales management team, who work with retailers to ensure a joint business strategy, cross promotions and shelf space optimization. 
Content Providers 
For content providers, our large base of Smart TVs that are in millions of homes across the United States provides an additional avenue to increase viewership and subscriptions. SmartCast enables them to reach a growing audience that is shifting away from linear TV. VIZIO Account provides consumers with a centralized payment and subscription management system that allows for a seamless way to subscribe to streaming services. We facilitate a win-win relationship with our content providers by acting as another distribution channel for their content. Our WatchFree+ provides an avenue for content providers to gain additional viewership and increase monetization opportunities. Additionally, our homepage serves as valuable real estate for content providers to promote new shows in order to drive engagement on their platforms. 
Advertisers 
For advertisers, we offer truly incremental reach to linear TV advertising, as many VIZIO consumers either do not connect a cable or satellite box to their Smart TVs, or supplement their linear TV viewing with streaming content. Additionally, our ACR and DAI capabilities allow for more targeted advertising, including for those consumers who view linear TV on our Smart TVs. The combination of our significant reach, ability to target ads and data insights improve advertisers’ return on investment. 
Our Technology
We are focused on providing the best consumer experience and powerful solutions for content providers and advertisers to reach a broad and engaged audience. We have developed an array of technologies that seamlessly integrate our hardware and software. Our integrated offerings allow us to provide exceptional value for consumers, retailers, content providers and advertisers. 
SmartCast 
Our application experiences are powered by a vast media library brought together by the SmartCast operating system. Through feed ingestion, content matching and metadata merging services, the SmartCast home page aggregates content from major third-party OTT apps and our free, ad-supported streaming service, WatchFree+, to enable a content-centric user experience. SmartCast then leverages user data and behavior to optimize recommendations and search results using AI. 
Automatic Content Recognition 
We offer a cutting edge, screen-embedded ACR technology that increases transparency and enhances targeting abilities for advertisers on our platform. We also license our data to measurement companies, advertising agencies, media and ad tech companies. Our ACR technology leverages viewing data from millions of VIZIO Smart TVs to help content providers and advertisers understand their audiences.
Hardware and Chipsets 
Our approach to picture quality, including our use of advanced design and our own algorithms, creates high-quality panels and give us a competitive advantage in the market when it comes to user experience. We continue to invest in these technologies that power our high-performing TV picture quality, including product design and specifications of LCD Panels, LED backlights, chipsets, software and Quantum Dot Films. 
Research and Development 
We are passionate about designing cutting-edge products that drive consumer demand and enhance our brand. We believe that our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to develop innovative new products, make enhancements to our existing products, and improve functionality and ease of use. We continue to employ a consumer-focused design approach by providing innovative products that respond to, anticipate and even drive consumer desires for enhanced picture quality, audio quality, functionality, design and ease of use. 
Our strong relationships with our supply chain partners allow us to collaborate with these partners on research and development with a significant pool of research and development capabilities and experience. Although we design our products in-house and perform high-value research and development in-house, we are able to leverage the resources of our suppliers’ research and development functions to execute quickly on new product introductions. 
We design our products to be aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on premium picture quality and an intuitive user experience. Our products include next generation technology, such as full-array LED backlighting, which enhances the viewing experience. 
Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment 
While all of our products are designed in California, we outsource manufacturing to a diversified base of manufacturers including BOE, Foxconn, Innolux, KIE, Tonly, TPV and Zylux, which purchase components and assemble our Smart TVs, sound bars and other entertainment products in facilities in China, Mexico, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The parts for our 
products are procured directly by our manufacturers. We utilize our business planning team to obtain competitive pricing on certain components, and we leverage our manufacturers’ volume purchases for best pricing on common parts. Televisions, sound bars and accessories are typically manufactured and packaged for retail sale and shipped via ocean freighter from our manufacturers in Asia and by trucks from our manufacturers in Mexico to logistics hubs. From the hubs, our devices are shipped using our logistics network of hubs and carriers to more than 250 destinations. We typically take ownership of the products directly from these logistics hubs, and our logistics team manages this process as we deliver the products to our retailers. We utilize a vendor-managed inventory strategy that allows us to reduce costs across the supply chain and improve inventory flexibility. 
Distribution and Marketing of Our Smart TVs and Sound Bars 
While we sell to large and small retailers across the United States and directly to consumers through our website, we have historically focused on the large-scale distribution channels to drive the most efficient economies of scale and accelerate our market share. This approach enabled us to keep our fixed costs low and grow revenue rapidly. 
Our marketing programs focus on engaging the wide spectrum of consumers from first-time shoppers to premium home theater enthusiasts, and leverage traditional advertising, high-impact sponsorships, and public relations, as well as more innovative digital marketing, social media, and retail marketing strategies that drive consideration and purchase. 
Our in-store retail merchandising strategy focuses on engaging consumers with point of purchase displays that showcase the picture and audio quality of our products and explain the benefits of our Smart TVs’ smart capabilities, technologies and features. We believe our merchandising strategy helps streamline the final purchase decision with simple, consistent messaging at the point of sale, including packaging, fact tags, and other item level signage. Our merchandising programs are designed to target the key demographics of the shoppers in each channel and are optimized for effective deployment and compliance with retailers’ operations, from mass market to warehouse club to premium electronics retail environments. 
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. 
We own and utilize the trade name “VIZIO” and the VIZIO logo and trademark on all of our products. We believe that having distinctive marks that are registered and readily identifiable is an important factor in identifying our brand. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 644 active trademark registrations and applications throughout the world, including 44 active trademark registrations and applications in the United States. 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 351 issued patents and 90 pending, allowed or published but not yet issued patent applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and the United Kingdom. However, we cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Our issued U.S. patents will expire between 2023 and 2041. 
Historically, we have been contractually indemnified and reimbursed by our manufacturers for most intellectual property royalty obligations and commitments. We receive such funding from the manufacturers either through direct reimbursement or payment of net purchase price. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such indemnities and reimbursements on favorable terms or at all. 
Competition 
We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our devices are brand, price, features, quality, design, consumer service, time-to-market and availability. We believe that we compete favorably in these areas. The consumer electronics market in which we operate is highly competitive and includes large, well-established companies. Our Smart TVs face competition from large consumer electronics brands such as Amazon, Samsung, Sony, LG, Hisense, TCL and Onn, Walmart’s private-label brand. Our sound bars face competition from large consumer electronics brands such as Samsung, Sony, LG, Bose, Sonos and Onn. 
Our Platform+ business competes both to be the entertainment hub of consumers’ homes and to attract advertising spend. We expect advertising spend to continue to shift from linear TV to connected TV, and as such we expect new competition to continue to intensify for viewership and for advertising spend. In this respect, we compete against other television brands with Smart TV offerings, such as Samsung, as well as connected devices such as Roku, Amazon and Apple TV and traditional cable operators seeking to integrate streaming media into their existing offerings. We also compete with OTT streaming services such as Hulu and YouTube TV, as such services are able to monetize across a variety of devices and consumers may engage with 
their content through devices other than our Smart TVs. We compete with these devices and services in part on the basis of user experience and content availability, including the availability of free content. In addition, we compete to attract advertising spending on the basis of the size of our audience and our ability to effectively target advertising. 
Government Oversight, Regulation and Privacy Practices 
In February 2017, we stipulated to the entry of a judgment in federal district court with, and paid certain penalties to, the Federal Trade Commission, the New Jersey Attorney General and Director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs to settle alleged violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (the Order). The Order requires us to provide additional notices (separate and apart from our privacy policies) to consumers when our devices are collecting information about what consumers are watching on our devices (viewing data). Under the Order, VIZIO devices connected to the internet may only collect viewing data from devices which have expressly consented to this practice, after receiving notice of the collection, use and sharing of viewing data and we must provide instructions on how consumers may revoke such consent for our devices. 
The Order also required us to delete certain viewing data we collected, prohibits us from misrepresenting our practices with respect to the privacy, security or confidentiality of consumer information we collect and requires us to maintain a privacy program with biennial assessments of that program and maintain certain records regarding our collection and use of consumer information. The obligations under the Order remain in effect until 2037. 
We strive to provide a valuable, transparent, and user-directed Smart TV platform service. We maintain privacy policies, management oversight, accountability structures and technology processes designed to protect privacy and personal information. Our posted privacy policies are accessible to users of our devices or applications, and visitors to our websites. These privacy policies disclose how we collect, use, share and protect information we collect from or about consumers or their devices. We follow a documented privacy management program and strive to ensure that our posted privacy policies are complete, accurate, fully implemented and consistent with applicable legal requirements. 
We collect and use personal information to create online accounts, effect e-commerce transactions, provide customer service, support and product registration, advertise VIZIO and third party products and services and for other purposes. We collect information through internet connected devices, such as Smart TVs, and also through our websites or mobile applications. We do not collect information about what content is playing on an internet connected VIZIO unit unless that unit has agreed to this collection, through an affirmative acceptance following display of a “separate and apart” disclosure regarding collection, use and sharing of such data, which meets or exceeds the Order’s requirements for prominence. Consumers also have means to opt-out of (if previously having opted-in to) this tracking through user settings on the device. 
In addition to the Order, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, data security, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payment processing, environmental matters including product chemical contents and packaging, taxation including advertising related taxation, and other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current policies and practices in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in new and rapidly evolving industries. 
The regulatory framework for data protection, privacy and information security is evolving rapidly. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Additionally, a new privacy law that significantly modifies the CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) went into effect on January 1, 2023. Aspects of the CCPA, the CPRA and other laws and regulations relating to data protection, privacy, and information security, as well as their enforcement, continue to evolve, and we have been, and may in the future be, required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. Foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive or burdensome than those in the United States. The CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for federal and state privacy legislation. On January 1, 2023 the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) went into effect, the CDPA provides to Virginia consumers similar rights as those afforded under the CCPA and CPRA. Many other states have also passed privacy legislation that will soon go into effect, for example, on July 7, 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA); on March 24, 2022, Utah enacted the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA); and on May 10, 2022, Connecticut enacted the Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (CPOMA), all of which are comprehensive privacy statutes that share similarities with the CCPA, CPRA, and legislation proposed in other states. The CPA, UCPA, and CPOMA will become effective on July 1, 2023, December 31, 2023, and July 1, 2023, respectively. The U.S. federal government also is contemplating federal privacy legislation. The CPA, UCPA, and CPOMA will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply with these new laws before 
they become effective. The CDPA, CPA, UCPA, CPOMA and any other state or federal legislation that is passed, could increase our potential liability, add layers of complexity to compliance in the U.S. market, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. 
Violation of existing or future regulatory orders, settlements or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” 
Human Capital
At VIZIO, we consider our relationship with our employees to be of the utmost importance and we strive to develop talent and invest in our employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 900 full time U.S.-based employees. We have not experienced a labor-related work stoppage, and none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In our efforts to manage our human capital, we seek to identify, attract, and retain employees who are aligned with and will help us progress towards our mission. 
Culture and Ethics
We believe that our corporate culture starts with having a commitment to ethics and integrity. We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics for our organization. We encourage employees to raise concerns free from retaliation, providing multiple avenues for reporting concerns including online and telephonic hotlines and the ability to report concerns anonymously. 
In addition, we are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and have adopted their Code of Conduct for our manufacturing supply chain. As an RBA member, we are committed to complying with the RBA code of conduct and implementing the RBA’s approach and tools in the spirit of the industry’s common goals. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Having a diverse and inclusive workplace is important to us. We believe that having a corporate culture of inclusivity and respect for others is vital to the overall success of our business. As of December 31, 2022, 60% of our Board of Directors was from underrepresented communities as defined by California AB 979, and 40% of our Board of Directors are women.
In 2022, we strived to foster and build an inclusive culture within the company. We hired an Employee Communications and Engagement Program Manager focused on initiating and coordinating activities to build better avenues for collaboration and improved employee communication by increasing our in-person activities, office footprint, and access to our office locations across the United States. 
We also worked to celebrate diverse communities through our corporate marketing activities and employee communications including: 
•highlighting Black History Month and Women’s History Month internally through employee communications;
•creating content campaigns through our Platform+ team to highlight diversity events throughout the year, including featuring On Demand collections on SmartCast for Black History Month, Women's History Month, Pride, Hispanic Heritage Month; and
•hosting several charitable initiatives, including food drives for local food banks at our Dakota Dunes location.
In 2022, we also laid the foundational groundwork for employee affinity groups and had home grown affinity groups for diversity, equity and inclusion. We are pleased to announce that in 2023 we are relaunching our women’s networking group and Employee Resource Group Strategy. 
We are an equal opportunity employer committed to diversity in the workplace. We consider all qualified candidates for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, protected veteran status, disability, or any other basis protected by law.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation and benefits package is designed to attract the talent necessary to grow and build our business and contribute to the long-term success of the organization. Our compensation package typically includes base salary, annual profit-sharing bonus, annual equity incentive award including an initial grant of RSUs and recurring grants every year thereafter, health insurance, dental insurance, 401(k) with matching, employee stock purchase program, and paid time off including paid parental leave.
In addition, to help our employees continue to grow in their careers and expand their skill sets, we provide our employees with access to free training programs and online courses. In addition, we also offer a tuition reimbursement program that allows 
employees to participate in courses of study at accredited colleges and universities and to participate in courses with organizations specializing in job and career-related education and training. 
Employee Satisfaction
Employee satisfaction is a critical component to the ensuring the long-term success of an organization. We engage with our employees periodically throughout the year through Employee Pulse Surveys to ask key questions regarding the programs and services offered to our employees and solicit feedback for ways in which the organization can change to better align with the needs of our workforce. 
Employee Wellness
We recognize the health and well-being of our employees is an important aspect of every employee and their ability to thrive at work and at home. We provide several employee wellness programs, including Wellness Wednesdays, which include virtual wellness classes such as Pilates and meditation, and a virtual wellness program which includes wellness contents and rewards such as earning additional paid-time off work for completing wellness activities. Our wellness programs also include providing access to classes and educational resources covering topics such as financial wellness, mental well-being, nutrition, and sleep.
Community and Social Impact
Making meaningful contributions to society helps to foster a sense of community for our workforce and provides our employees with opportunities to support causes that are important to them. Throughout the year we sponsor several corporate philanthropic programs for our employees to participate in, with employee and employer-based contribution opportunities. Through these philanthropic programs, VIZIO and our workforce contributed to charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, Toys for Tots, and Feeding America. 
Sustainability
We understand the importance of sustainability and have taken steps to help mitigate our environmental impact. We operate an electronic waste recycling program that has been recognized multiple times by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In 2022, our electronic waste recycling program partnered with a third-party certified recycler to divert over 28 million pounds of electronic waste from landfills. These pounds were either recycled or refurbished and resold following applicable legal requirements. In addition, in 2022 we had team members serving in leadership capacities within the electronics recycling arena including the E-stewards Leadership Council, Electronics Recycling Representative Organization, and Washington Materials Management & Financing Authority. 
Corporate Information

In March 2021, VIZIO, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VIZIO Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, through a holding company reorganization.
