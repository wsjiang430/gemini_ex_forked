Item 1. Business
Our Mission
Our mission is to democratize law. We believe every business deserves the full protection of the legal system and a simple way to stay compliant with it. Our platform helps new businesses form. Once a small business is formed, we offer subscription services to protect the business, its ideas, and the families that create them. LegalZoom empowers small business owners to apply their energy and passion to their businesses instead of the legal and regulatory complexity required to operate them.
Our Business
LegalZoom is a leading online platform for legal and compliance solutions in the United States, or U.S. Our unique position at business inception allows us to become a trusted business advisor, supporting the evolving needs of a new business across its lifecycle. Along with formation, LegalZoom offerings include ongoing compliance and tax advice and filings, virtual mailbox solutions, trademark filings, and estate plans. We operate across all 50 states and over 3,000 counties in the U.S., and have more than 20 years of experience navigating complex regulation and simplifying the legal and compliance process for our customers.
Many small businesses operate without forming a legal entity, unintentionally introducing financial risk to the owners’ personal assets. The businesses that recognize that risk upfront often struggle to address it. Once they understand the need to be protected, they often do not know what to do, where to turn or how much it will cost to get help. Even when formed properly, small businesses often fail to comply with ongoing compliance requirements, thereby reintroducing personal liability or facing significant financial and operational risk. Furthermore, these difficulties are becoming more acute as the number of U.S. business formations increase, driven by various macroeconomic factors such as the rise of the gig economy and remote work, accentuating the need for a trusted, cost-effective, digital-first and simple legal and compliance solution.
Our platform combines the power of technology and people to demystify and simplify complicated processes, creating user-friendly experiences for our customers. Our proprietary technology enables us to automate many complex legal and compliance processes, allowing us to offer solutions at transparent, flat-fee prices that are at a significant discount to traditional offline alternatives. While the majority of our customers complete these transactions without human assistance, many prefer to have some guidance through the process. The combination of technology and people is at the heart of our unique customer experience. For our customers looking for general help, our customer care and sales organization is available for real-time guidance on how to use our services. For customers preferring credentialed assistance, we embed the option for them to retain attorneys and certified public accountants, or CPAs, from the beginning of the customer journey. In addition, our unique and trusted position at business formation gives us unparalleled knowledge of our customers’ needs prior to the business being operational or discoverable by other service providers. We leverage this valuable knowledge and our position as a small business’ first advisor to introduce our customers to the most relevant business solutions within our partner ecosystem to help them run other aspects of their business.
We believe we earn small businesses’ trust and drive significant organic traffic through our free proprietary educational content, which is often our first interaction with a potential customer. From there, our small business customers’ initial purchase is typically a formation product that streamlines the process of starting a business. Alongside and after this initial transaction, our customers generally purchase annual subscription services to solve additional legal, compliance and tax needs, deepening our relationship with our customers. With recurring revenue through subscription services and repurchases from existing customers, we continue to benefit from an increasing customer lifetime value.
Industry Trends
Millions of people start small businesses every year, a trend driven by digital enablement and the gig economy. Small business owners often do not know that they may face personal liability and tax consequences depending on their business formation decision and many try to figure out legal requirements on their own, often facing regulatory problems for noncompliance. It can be frustrating, time consuming and expensive to navigate multiple layers of legal and compliance requirements. There are structural impediments that make traditional offline attorneys unable to adapt to consumer behaviors and technology advancements. While service industries like accounting, tax, marketing and payments have rapidly transitioned online, legal offerings largely remain offline. Online adoption of legal services lags behind other comparable industries. The gap between a small business owner’s legal and compliance needs and available offline solutions is widening. The challenges associated with traditional offline “do it yourself” or “find an expert” options are becoming relatively worse as service level expectations increase as a result of small business 
enablement in other industries. Technological advances are transforming consumer expectations for professional services.
Our Competition
We operate in a very competitive industry. We face intense competition from offline law firms and attorneys, online legal document services, legal plans, secretaries of state, tax preparation companies and other service providers. Law firms and solo attorneys, who provide in-person consultations and are able to provide direct legal advice that we generally cannot offer due to laws and regulations regarding the unauthorized practice of law, or UPL, compete with us offline and have and may develop competing online legal services. However, we previously applied for and received a license to operate as an alternative business structure, or ABS, in Arizona, which allows corporate entities to become licensed providers of reserved legal activities in that jurisdiction. As a result, our Arizona ABS is able to compete directly with more traditional offline law firms and solo attorneys. We also compete in the registered agent services business with several companies that target small businesses. In addition, certain U.S. states, including Nevada, California and Louisiana, offer online portals where consumers may file their articles of organization for free, other than filing fees. 
Our direct and indirect competitors, whether they are online legal document providers, legal plan providers, law firms, accounting firms, solo attorneys or large internet providers, may also be developing innovative and cost-effective services that target our existing and potential customers. In recent years, we have seen certain online competitors target more price conscious customers by offering business formation transactions at little or no charge while cross-selling subscription compliance services. We expect to face increasing competition from offline and online legal services providers in our market, and our failure to effectively compete with these providers could result in revenue reductions, reduced margins, and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.
We believe competitive factors for our services include ease of use, breadth of offerings, brand name recognition, reputation, price, quality and customer service and that we compare favorably on all these bases.
Our Strategy
We are in the early stages of penetrating and growing the online market for small business legal and compliance services. We expect to continue to grow our customer base and retain and expand our customer relationships following formation with the following strategies:
Grow our customer base. We continue to grow the top of our funnel and improve our customer experience in order to grow our customer base. To accelerate growth, we intend to continue to invest in our brand to increase awareness of the protection that legal and compliance services offer small businesses, and the ease and affordability of our platform. We also intend to broaden our customer top of funnel through the introduction of lower-priced products and services targeting more price-sensitive customer segments. Finally, we continue to partner with leading brands that can help our small business customers and improve our partner ecosystem. As we attract more visitors to our website, we believe that we have a large opportunity to increase conversion of prospects into customers. 
Retain and expand our customer relationships following formation. As we innovate for small businesses, we aim to become their trusted partner for life. In order to do this, we intend to:
•Launch adjacent services. Our strategy is to meaningfully expand our product line to offer a solution for the majority of small business legal and compliance needs. 
•Partner to offer our customers broader ecosystem solutions. We plan to offer additional access to third-party solutions to further support small business needs in areas such as banking, payments, payroll, accounting, and website hosting. 
•Increase customer lifetime value. We plan to continue to improve the lifetime value of our customers, particularly by increasing retention of our small business subscribers through maintaining engagement post-purchase, adding new solutions to serve additional needs, and improving lifecycle marketing to increase retention rates. 
•Increase our market opportunity by introducing a new tier of higher-value assisted offerings. We aim to reduce peoples’ uncertainty and doubt about forming a business on their own by offering “assisted” solutions alongside our “do it yourself” offerings for their legal and compliance needs. We plan to provide more value to our customers from existing product lines by adding a tier of attorney assisted solutions and continuing to expand our professional-assisted offerings to complement our technology-enabled solutions.
Our Products and Services
We help customers form their businesses, protect their ideas, stay compliant and scale their operations. Our products and services include business formations, creating estate planning documents, protecting intellectual property, completing certain forms and agreements, providing access to independent attorney advice, and connecting customers with experts for tax preparation services. The primary driver of new customers is small business formation transactions, and at that moment we aim to start a deeper relationship reflected in bundled subscription services and 
partner offerings. This combination creates a suite of legal and compliance solutions that are relevant for our customers’ ongoing needs. We also have a partner ecosystem that enables us to offer third-party services to our customers and to offer our services to our partners’ customers.

Subscription services

Small Business Subscriptions | Consumer Subscriptions 
Registered AgentComplianceAttorney Advice through our Legal PlansTax Advice and PreparationAccounting and PayrollLegal FormsVirtual Mail and Check Deposit Services | Attorney Advice through our Legal PlansEstate Planning BundleLegal FormsVirtual Mail and Check Deposit Services

Registered agent subscriptions. In most states, a business entity, such as an LLC or corporation, is required to appoint and maintain a registered agent in its state of formation to receive service of process and official government communications. The entity must disclose the address of its appointed registered agent and, in many states, the registered agent must be available during business hours. This requirement can be burdensome for many small businesses to handle on their own. Our registered agent services receive, process, and forward served legal documents digitally or physically to the customer. 
Compliance subscriptions. Our compliance subscriptions provide assistance with state-mandated regulatory filings, such as tax returns and corporate annual reports that are required to keep a business entity in good standing. The subscription plans also monitor the status of our customers’ businesses with certain state agencies and provide alerts to notify them if they fall out of good standing as well as to stay abreast of important deadlines.
Attorney advice subscriptions. For small businesses and consumers seeking legal advice, we offer subscription legal plans that provide access to independent attorneys in all 50 states. These subscriptions also include other benefits, such as access to legal forms, discounts on additional legal services offered by the network attorney, and, in some cases, an annual checkup with the network attorney for estate planning purposes.
Tax subscriptions. We introduced our LegalZoom-fulfilled tax subscription, or LZ Tax, in October 2020. This subscription includes tax advice on essential tax matters at both state and federal levels with the option to add tax preparation, as well as advice from a tax expert, either a CPA or an enrolled agent. In addition, our customers receive 
a consultation included in their formation that includes guidance on their tax strategy, including how to maximize their deductions and income. Our tax services help small businesses get set up right from the beginning to minimize their tax bill. 
Legal forms and other subscriptions. We offer other subscriptions, including unlimited access to our library of legal forms, electronic storage of applicable LegalZoom documents, and document revisions. Through our acquisition of Revvsales Inc. in October 2022, we plan to enhance our forms library and legal template offerings and integrate e-signature capabilities into our platform. Additionally, we offer subscriptions that enable customers to monitor trademark applications, create meeting minutes for their board of directors’ meetings and monitor compliance calendar deadlines.
Our subscription agreements generally have annual terms, while some have monthly terms. They are generally non-refundable during their term, including any renewal term, after a 60-day refund period at the beginning of the initial term and any renewal term. They generally automatically renew at the end of each term unless notice of cancellation of the renewal is provided any time in advance of the renewal date. We generally do not issue pro rata refunds outside of the applicable 60-day refund period. Customers can cancel the automatic renewal on our website or by phone. In the case of our subscriptions for registered agent services, the customer needs to appoint a new registered agent for its business in order to complete a cancellation.
Partner ecosystem
We have unique insights into our customers and leverage our product as a channel to introduce small businesses to our partner ecosystem, solving even more of their needs. Our partnering arrangements include reseller models, revenue share, and flat fees earned by introducing small businesses to leading providers of small business services such as banking, credit cards, business licenses, website design, and payment processing. 
In addition to serving small businesses and consumers, we offer a developer platform, including APIs that enable external developers to co-brand or white-label business formation and compliance services with a highly integrated solution. Our enterprise segment customers include both large enterprises and small business platforms with a significant number of users. Our solutions provide large enterprises the ability to manage their multi-entity legal and compliance needs and small business platforms to offer business formation and compliance services to their own customers, either within their own customer experience or by referring the customer to us. 
New product development
Our product development strategy is focused on reducing friction and increasing conversion across our existing core products and services, expanding our portfolio of new products and services, gaining market share, and strategically deepening customer relationships, including in ways that will make legal and compliance expertise available to our customers and increase our recurring revenue through subscription offerings. 
Seasonality
Historically, our customers have tended to place a higher number of orders and entered into new or renewed subscriptions in the first quarter of the year, which is when we believe the demand for forming businesses is the highest. Further seasonality is reflected in the timing of our revenue recognition in the second quarter, when we have typically recognized a high amount of revenue from orders placed in the first quarter but fulfilled in the second quarter. Also, we have historically seen demand for our services decline around the beginning of the third quarter as a result of summer vacations and in the last two months of the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holidays. While the seasonality of our business was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020 and into 2021, we have since seen a return to more typical historical trends. 
Our Technology
We have developed a highly scalable and flexible technology platform that enables us to efficiently process thousands of customer orders daily and facilitate seamless interactions with our customers and the independent attorneys participating in our legal network. We devote substantial resources to consistently enhance our technology platform. Key components of our technology are described below.
Dynamic online questionnaire
Legal documents are populated by our platform through the use of our dynamic online questionnaires. Our customers complete a comprehensive yet intuitive questionnaire that is powered by a rules-based engine to pose questions based on the customer’s legal jurisdiction, location and prior responses to solicit the information needed to comply with local and state laws and regulations.
Document automation
Our technology platform includes complex automation systems that transfer customer responses into many state or county-specific templates to generate customized legal documents. Our automation unifies the various methods used by states and counties to form businesses into a single easy-to-understand customer experience. We use straight through processing for several products, which has enabled us to deliver the documents to the customer in near real-time. 
Compliance platform
We have built a system to notify our customers of upcoming compliance milestones and associated requirements. Additionally, for our registered agent subscribers, we have a system of receiving, scanning, sorting, and labeling documents from state agencies across the country that leverages technology to quickly deliver physical and electronic copies to our customer.
Robust CRM platform
Our account executives, customer care and sales organization, fulfillment specialists, and tax advisors leverage a multi-channel customer relationship management platform, powered by integrating a variety of tier one contact center technologies. The platform is integrated within our production and fulfillment systems and enables us to support customers through communications via multiple channels including our websites, email, text, phone, online chat, and our mobile applications. 
Scalable and secure infrastructure
Our platform resides on a combination of on-premises infrastructure and best-in-class public cloud-based platforms. Our platform is highly scalable to accommodate an increasing volume of customer orders. We have designed our websites to be highly intuitive and secure using proprietary software and commercially supported tools. 
Our website allows users to access the same content on our platform from their laptops, tablets, or smart phones. We also maintain apps on iOS and Android that make it easy for customers to access their documents, schedule consultations, and get status updates on their orders.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our proprietary technology is an important and valuable part of our business. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. We frequently file applications for trademarks and service marks in order to protect our intellectual property. 
We have various trademark registrations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, as well as pending trademark applications in the U.S. We have no issued patents. We also license intellectual property from third-parties, such as software used to support our technology and operations.
In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Our Attorney Advice Network
We offer attorney advice across all 50 states in the U.S. to our subscribers through a network of independent law firms that manage relationships with independent attorneys.
Our brand and marketing efforts allow the participating attorneys to focus more on the practice of law and less on business development. The initial consultation serves as a platform for business development, where the participating attorney can offer to provide billable legal services to our customers at discounted rates. In addition, participating law firms can leverage our brand awareness as well as the customer feedback and testimonials to market their own practice. Each firm receives a flat administrative fee from us for each legal plan participant in its area to cover the administrative costs associated with participating in our network.
Customer Care
Our customer care representatives provide assistance, support and account management to small businesses and individuals. Exceptional customer experience is central to our culture and we take pride in our customer care team.
Our customers have access to live help from customer care representatives by phone, online chat, text, email, or via our mobile applications. In addition, our website and mobile experience contain extensive educational content in an article center, FAQs and a knowledge center designed to assist customers in choosing the products and services that best suit their needs.
We actively monitor our service levels, fulfillment speed and quality to maintain a high level of customer care. Customer care team members have metrics-driven incentives that further align their goals and compensation with our focus on the customer while maintaining regulatory compliance. 
Sales and Marketing
We invest significantly to create a highly recognizable legal brand, online and offline and we attract a meaningful percentage of unpaid website traffic, underscoring our brand strength and unique content offering. Our content 
marketing includes educational initiatives such as our Article Center on our website, where we create content to better inform our customers on how they can plan for and protect themselves, their families, and their businesses.
We use a strategic mix of online and offline marketing in combination with inbound sales. Our largest customer acquisition media spend is in search engine marketing to capture demand generated by our other paid and organic channels. We also advertise from time to time across television, radio, podcasts, digital video, and social media. 
In taking customer calls, our sales team uses a conversational approach to introduce our services, explain features and recommend various partners. When our sales team becomes involved, the average order size frequently increases due to our team’s effectiveness in selling ancillary offerings. Our sales teams also proactively target qualified prospects, such as those who began a questionnaire in our customer experience journey but have yet to purchase.
Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2022, we, together with all our subsidiaries, had 1,383 employees worldwide. At December 31, 2022, we also engaged approximately 400 contractors and consultants in the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Our primary compensation strategy is to promote a pay-for-performance culture. Our guiding principles are anchored on the goals of being able to attract, incentivize, and retain talented employees who can develop, implement, and drive long-term value creation strategies. We’ve designed our compensation approach so that every U.S. based employee has a component of their compensation that is performance or incentive driven. We offer competitive compensation that we believe is aligned with the market and fair relative to our peers.
At LegalZoom, one of our core values is People First. By that, we not only mean caring for and protecting the millions of customers we have served since inception, but investing in, empowering and fostering trust and wellness among our employees. In order to better understand the needs of our employees, we launched a new employee feedback platform that allows us to survey our employees on a regular basis. We were able to establish baseline employee net promoter, or NPS, and employee satisfaction scores, along with other feedback that measures satisfaction in a variety of areas. We are now able to take very specific action based on the voice of the employee to better serve our organization.
We have remained agile to accommodate the ever-changing needs of our employees since the pandemic. In 2021, we announced the adoption of our remote first model, which required coordinated efforts across the organization to operationalize. Over the last year, our strategy has been focused on engaging employees virtually to support working from home by launching virtual productivity and collaboration tools, and driving engagement through virtual events. In addition, while they remain primarily remote, we engaged with corporate employees who are located near our existing offices to enable them to leverage offices for in-person meetings where live collaboration could help foster improved productivity and engagement. To facilitate this, in the summer of 2022, we re-opened our Glendale, California, and Austin, Texas, locations to our remote first teams, creating intentional collaboration spaces that would enable in-person working sessions and team engagement. We also opened a new location in Mountain View, California and Playa Vista, California, where we had a large cluster of employees residing, to have a space where our remote first teams could have the opportunity to engage with their co-workers in person. This approach has allowed us to build foundational infrastructure and establish a stronger culture both virtually and in-person.
We have also invested in employee engagement to help improve connectedness in our remote-first work environment. In 2022, we launched an employee recognition tool that rewards and provides visibility to our employees’ accomplishments. We also continue to fuel our organization’s passion for social good, and launched a new employee giving program and tool that provides dollar-for-dollar matching and paid time off or volunteering for causes our employees care about most. Finally, we continue to engage our employees in in-person and remote social impact events, like our second annual Impact Week, where we come together to volunteer and raise funds for various causes.
In 2022, we remained committed to our principles of taking care of our employees holistically while continuously looking for ways to improve our overall benefits offering. We offer competitive benefits including: 100% employer-paid medical, travel reimbursement for out-of-state procedures, dental and vision plans, fertility coverage, mental health coverage, physical wellness, and paid-time off, including a continuous week off, called Wellness Break for all employees. In addition, we made a number of meaningful enhancements in 2022’s November Open Enrollment for 2023, including increasing our offerings on mental health and parental leave for non-birthing parents, additional gender equality benefits, additional sick-time off and paid company holidays, and new lifestyle benefits for our employees to use in a way that represents them and expanding coverage on our dental and vision plans.
We believe we are thriving when every voice is nurtured and heard. We have six employee resource groups today, including Pride Zoomer Alliance Network, Lift Every Voice Black Network, RiseUp Women’s Network, Women in Tech Network, and Nos Unimos LatinX Network, each with dedicated internal funding, executive sponsorship and a focus on supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion within and outside of LegalZoom. These networks have built internal mentorship and development programs, and contributed to their broader communities outside of LegalZoom through their initiatives.
Government Regulation
We operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations, including those related to internet activities, UPL, the corporate practice of law, or CPL, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, data retention, consumer protection, content regulation, the processing of legal documents, legal plans, the provision of online payment services and other matters, which are continuously evolving and developing. 
Our business model includes the provision of services that represent an alternative to traditional legal services, which has subjected us to allegations of UPL in the U.S. UPL generally refers to an entity or person giving or offering legal advice who is not licensed to practice law. However, laws and regulations defining UPL, and the governing bodies that enforce UPL rules, differ among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment in the U.S. is evolving slowly with two states so far, Arizona and Utah, approving regulatory reform that permits non-lawyers to co-own law firms and other legal service operations. We applied for and received a license to operate as an Arizona ABS on September 30, 2021, through our U.S. subsidiary, LZ Legal Services, LLC. This Arizona ABS employs and contracts with licensed attorneys to provide limited scope legal services to U.S.-based consumers who purchase such services on our websites. While we believe this ABS structure is legally permissible, it is generally untested in U.S. courts and we cannot assure you that it will insulate us from claims of CPL or UPL. These laws and regulations are regularly evolving and tested in courts, and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. 
In addition, we are subject to numerous foreign and domestic laws, regulations, and standards regarding privacy and data security governing the personal information and other data that we may collect, store, use, or process. Such privacy and data security laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance.
 Our compliance with applicable government laws and regulations is not expected to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict what laws will be enacted in the future, or how existing or future laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced. We also cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims and lawsuits relating to, these various laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
