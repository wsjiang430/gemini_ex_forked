Item 1. Business
 Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. is a global sports and entertainment company. We own and operate premium sports properties, including the UFC, produce and distribute sports and entertainment content, own and manage exclusive live events and experiences, and represent top sports, entertainment and fashion talent, as well as blue chip corporate clients. Founded as a client representation business, we expanded organically and through strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in new capabilities, including sports operations and advisory, events and experiences management, media production and distribution, sports data and technology, brand licensing, and experiential marketing. Today, the integration of our broad range of capabilities, along with our owned and managed premium sports and entertainment properties, drives network effects across the Endeavor flywheel, which is the way we connect and utilize multiple divisions of Endeavor to maximize the power of our platform, creating value for our business, clients and employees. We measure these effects by evaluating the impact that activity in one business segment has on growth in another.
 We believe that our unique business model gives us a competitive advantage in the industries in which we operate. Our ownership of premium sports properties allows us to benefit from the generally rising value and increasing scarcity of ownable, scalable sports assets. Our dual role as an intellectual property owner and a trusted advisor to clients and rights holders allows us to make connections across the Endeavor flywheel, increasing the earnings of our clients and the value of our sports and entertainment properties. We generally participate in the upside related to the commercial success of content with limited risk and we benefit from demand from both traditional and next generation distributors. We own and manage a diverse mix of premium live events and experiences in the sports, entertainment, fashion, and art categories. The insights we gain from our connectivity across the sports and entertainment ecosystem may enable us to spot trends before they emerge and make strategic investments to enhance our growth.
We operate across three segments: (i) Owned Sports Properties, (ii) Events, Experiences & Rights, and (iii) Representation, which are covered in greater detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Overview.” Our segments are presented in the table below:

Beginning January 1, 2023, we created a fourth segment, Sports Data & Technology, which includes our IMG ARENA and OpenBet businesses.
We generate revenue in both a principal and an agency capacity and use risk mitigation strategies including pre-sales and licensing when we take on investment risk in content or sports rights. Our business has benefited from strong revenue visibility via sports rights fee payments, predictable client commissions, content rights payments, recurring annual, biennial or quadrennial events, corporate client retainers, licensing agreements, and annual tuition payments. We believe that visibility into our performance provides us with a stable and growing revenue base.
 
Our Integrated Global Business
 Across our segments, our global portfolio of premium owned assets and integrated set of capabilities, including client representation, media production & distribution, experiential marketing, and brand licensing drive revenue generation opportunities, improve client retention, and increase the flow of acquisition and investment opportunities.
Our integrated global business allows us to drive powerful network effects that reinforce the value of the Endeavor flywheel. We believe the greater the depth of our capabilities and global reach, the greater our ability to retain clients and drive new signings. The more top-tier clients we bring to market, the more relevant we become to streamers, linear networks, and corporate partners. The more premium sports, events, and experiences inventory we have, the more opportunity we can deliver to our global sponsors and media companies. We also believe that our growing global insights enhance our judgment on investments made, while the more we are able to learn from our clients, the more we can enhance the value and growth we deliver long term.
Owned Sports Properties
We believe that our Company is distinguished by our ownership of intellectual property, including UFC, a global sports property and the premier mixed martial arts sports organization, and PBR, the world's premier bull riding circuit. UFC was founded in 1993 and has grown in popularity, having now hosted more than 600 events and grown its fan base to more than 680 million fans. UFC has developed its global audience of over 900 million households through an increasing array of global broadcast license agreements and its owned FIGHT PASS streaming platform. PBR now features more than 800 bull riders competing in more than 200 bull riding events each year. PBR’s overall live event attendance has increased by more than 40% since PBR was acquired by Endeavor in 2015. In 2022, PBR entertained approximately one million fans across its tour events for the first time in its history and grossed its highest ever annual consumer ticketing revenue. We also have an up to 20-year strategic partnership with Euroleague, consisting of an initial 10-year term that began in 2016 with a 10-year renewal provision subject to certain conditions. As sports property owners, we retain control over the organization, promotion and marketing of UFC and PBR, and the monetization of their events and media distribution. At the end of 2021 and in January 2022, we acquired ten Major League Baseball Professional Development League clubs (the "PDL Clubs"), which were being operated under the Diamond Baseball Holdings, LLC ("DBH") umbrella. In September 2022, we sold the DBH business, including the PDL Clubs.
Events, Experiences & Rights
 We own, operate, or represent hundreds of global events annually, including live sports events covering more than 15 sports across more than 25 countries (e.g., ATP Tour Events, such as the Miami Open and Madrid Open), international fashion weeks (e.g., New York Fashion Week), art fairs (e.g., Frieze London and Frieze Seoul), music, culinary, and lifestyle festivals (e.g., The Big Feastival), and major attractions (e.g., Hyde Park Winter Wonderland and Barrett-Jackson). On Location, a leading provider of global premium live event experiences across sports and music, services more than 1,200 events and experiences built around major events, including the Super Bowl, the Aer Lingus Classic college football game, the Ryder Cup, the NCAA Final Four, Coachella and the next three Olympic Games. We also operate IMG Academy, a leading sports and education brand with an innovative suite of on-campus and online programming, including its Bradenton, Florida boarding school and sports camps, IMG Academy+ online coaching, and Next College Student Athlete ("NCSA") college recruiting. The boarding school serves more than 1,400 full-time students, provides campers and adult athletes approximately 15,000 camp experiences annually, and hosts a number of professional athletes, teams, leagues, and corporate clients.
 As one of the largest independent global distributors of sports and entertainment programming, we manage, advise on, and sell media rights globally on behalf of more than 150 clients, such as the International Olympic Committee, the ATP Tour and the National Hockey League ("NHL"), as well as for our owned assets, including UFC and PBR. Our production business is one of the largest creators of sports programming in the world, responsible for thousands of hours of content on behalf of more than 200 federations, associations and events, including the English Premier League, The R&A, DP World Tour, and our owned asset, UFC, as well as owned channels Sport 24 and EDGEsport. Through our digital agency, Seven League, we build strategies and digital ecosystems, and run and monetize digital channels for clients, including the National Football League ("NFL"), the National Basketball Association ("NBA") and the NHL. Our sports data business, IMG ARENA, provides data and content to sportsbooks and media partners around the globe, delivering data feeds from approximately 43,000 sports events annually. This data powers IMG ARENA's Event Centre product suite, including the UFC Event Centre. In addition, IMG ARENA provides live video streams for sportsbooks for approximately 48,000 events per year, as well as a portfolio of virtual sports products. We leverage the technology derived from IMG ARENA to provide streaming video solutions to our clients and our owned assets via Endeavor Streaming. In addition, we closed our acquisition of leading B2B sports betting technology provider, OpenBet, in the third quarter of 2022, which, together with IMG ARENA, formed a new operating segment January 1, 2023. We believe that our collective offering is more important than ever, as the demand for premium content and live experiences continues to be strong.
 
Representation
 We represent many of the world’s greatest creators, performers, influencers, athletes, and models across entertainment, sports, and fashion. In 2022, WME clients were involved in five of the top 10 grossing films at the domestic box office, including three of the top five. We were responsible for arranging the essential elements for more than 310 scripted series on broadcast, cable, and streaming channels. WME also closed deals for more than 200 new books, including 57 bestsellers. We had a strong presence at major music festivals in 2022, with over 30 clients performing at Lollapalooza and more than 25 clients performing at Stagecoach, accounting for nearly half the lineup at the latter. In theater, WME clients garnered 15 nominations and two wins at the 2022 Tony Awards and WME represented talent in more than 60% of the productions that opened in the 2021-2022 Broadway season. In sports, clients took home both men’s and women’s US Open singles tennis championships and three clients were selected as lottery picks in the 2022 NBA Draft, the most of any agency. We are dedicated to helping our clients increase the monetization potential of their intellectual property, build enduring brands, diversify and grow their businesses, and expand their geographic reach.
We are also a leading provider of licensing services to entertainment, sports, and consumer products brands with nearly $15 billion in total retail sales. Our licensing business ranked No. 1 in 2022 according to License Global magazine. We license our owned intellectual property, including the UFC and PBR, and represent third party brands across the automotive, fashion, lifestyle, entertainment, athletics, legends, personalities, corporate, sports league, and event categories. Our clients include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Dolly Parton, Jeep, Lamborghini, Lionsgate, Epic Games (Fortnite), Gap, and the NFL.
Meanwhile, marketing services are delivered by 160over90, our full-service cultural marketing agency specializing in integrated services including experiential, influencer, social and digital, and public relations/communications. 160over90 works on behalf of some of the world’s largest brands, including Amazon, Capital One, AB InBev and USAA. The agency also partners with some of the fastest growing brands among US adults, according to a Morning Consult 2022 Brand Report, including Bose, Major League Baseball and T-Mobile. Through our owned and operated events and represented clients, our marketing services have access to unique content and activation opportunities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Ownership of Intellectual Property
 We believe that our Company is distinguished by ownership of intellectual property, including UFC, PBR and Euroleague. UFC posted its best financial year ever for the fourth consecutive year in 2022, including signing a landmark partnership deals with blockchain technology leader VeChain and setting records for the highest grossing Fight Night in UFC history both globally and in the U.S. PBR live attendance, sponsorship revenue and licensing revenue are all up significantly since our 2015 acquisition, and in 2022, the sport launched a transformative business initiative in its PBR Team Series. In 2022, more than one million fans attended PBR's Unleash the Beast, Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour and Team Series events. In addition to these sports properties, we also own marquee global events including the Miami Open, Madrid Open, Frieze art fairs, Barrett-Jackson, and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, and are uniquely positioned to drive increases in areas including sponsorship, hospitality and ticket sales.
Leading Supplier of Premium Sports and Entertainment Content
 We are positioned at the center of and benefit from the continued demand for content in all forms through our owned sports properties, media production and distribution, and client representation businesses. We operate across all major content verticals and benefit regardless of how and where the demand for this content is fulfilled. In 2022, we delivered the essential talent for more than 310 new and returning WME series across broadcast, cable and streaming, and converted 300 books to film/television. Premium sports and entertainment content values have consistently appreciated as new distribution models and technology broaden access and enhance the consumer experience. The value of sports programming has significantly increased as media networks and over-the-top services rely on premium sports to differentiate their offerings and retain subscribers. Disruption has increased the value of sports media rights as illustrated in consistent increases in contract Average Annual Values (AAV). Even as digital video distribution services such as ESPN+, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max, and others have proliferated in recent years, consumer demand for premium content remains. Additionally, commercially successful movies and television programming have lasting resonance that drives consumption at release and over time across multiple points of purchase. The long tail of premium content has thereby enabled significant value creation to accrue to the creators we represent as well as shareholders.
Well Positioned to Capitalize on Experience Economy
 A University of Texas at Austin research paper published in May 2020 found that consumers were happier when spending on experiences as opposed to material items. Recognizing the opportunity, we built a portfolio of hundreds of events globally across sports, music, art, fashion, and culinary. Our events include UFC, PBR, Miami Open, Madrid Open, Frieze art fairs, Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, and Barrett-Jackson. Through IMG Academy, we offer an elite academic and athletic experience both on-campus and online, and delivered record summer camp attendance in 2022. On Location, meanwhile, is a leading provider of premium entertainment and travel experiences, offering packages for more than 1,200 events, including music tours and festivals, hundreds of collegiate game packages, and several white label events. Its marquee events include the Super Bowl, which experienced record hospitality sales for Super Bowl LVI (2022), making it the largest single hospitality event in On Location's history, as well as the next three Olympic Games, the NCAA Final Four, and Coachella. Finally, 160over90, our full-service cultural marketing agency, works on behalf of some of the world's largest brands to build memorable marketing campaigns.
Network Insights Create Asymmetric Risk / Reward Opportunities
 We believe that the insights we gain from our vast network reduce the potential risk inherent in organic investment and mergers and acquisitions. Our team evaluates potential merger and acquisition opportunities with the benefit of data and firsthand industry knowledge that enables us to identify integration synergies and better forecast revenue growth potential. Our role as an industry counterpart often affords us early insights into strategic processes. As an example, we represented UFC for its media rights deals before we invested in the business and ultimately acquired it in full. Through our Talent Ventures arm, we often have the opportunity to invest in and support new business ventures that we have negotiated on behalf of our clients, and our commission structure allows us to participate alongside them in their commercial success. In 2022, we closed more than 35 equity deals within this framework on behalf of clients and invested in several as a company.
Flywheel Drives Upside for Our Stakeholders
 The practical linkages between our business units have produced myriad new revenue generation opportunities, improved client acquisition and retention, and proprietary acquisition and investment opportunities. Throughout the portfolio, our owned assets and capabilities reinforce the others, creating a global integrated flywheel that is very difficult to replicate. We have executed multi-pronged growth strategies on behalf of clients including Serena Williams, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Mark Wahlberg, Maria Sharapova, and many others, leveraging our network to forge meaningful partnerships between our talent and brands. Through our deep relationships and expertise in sports like golf and tennis, we have expanded our capabilities in the sports betting and data industry via IMG ARENA and our acquisition of OpenBet. Our sports rights and representation businesses have similarly helped unlock investment and advisory opportunities for properties such as the PGA and Euroleague. We have realized top line and cost synergies as we have integrated more than 30 acquisitions including IMG, UFC, PBR, 160over90, and On Location.
Strong Revenue Visibility
 Our services are underpinned by highly visible and recurring revenue streams across the business. A primary example is our domestic and international media rights deals for UFC, including a 7-year deal with ESPN for domestic rights. We have numerous similarly contracted revenue streams from media rights contracts in our media rights and distribution business, as well as through our sponsorship deals of our owned sports properties, including UFC. Our work with recurring annual events such as Wimbledon and quadrennial events such as the Rugby World Cup adds to the recurring revenue nature of our business. We also have retainer-based agreements with many of our marketing clients and visibility into commissions on licensing arrangements. Our representation business benefits from revenue visibility, predictable production volumes, and residual income streams from past client bookings and content packages. We also benefit from strong revenue visibility from annual owned and operated events like the Miami Open, Madrid Open and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, which have been running successfully for at least a decade. Finally, our four-year tuition-based IMG Academy provides a high degree of revenue visibility.
Our Growth Strategies
 
Leverage the Endeavor Flywheel to Drive Organic Growth
 We intend to continue leveraging our integrated global platform to maximize the growth potential of our business. The convergence of the sports, entertainment, live events, and technology ecosystems has expanded use cases, exposure and monetization opportunities for our premium intellectual property, content and experiences, and our clients. We believe that our integrated capabilities and global reach allow us to deepen relationships with existing clients, attract new clients and partners, and access proprietary acquisition and investment opportunities that contribute to our growth and strengthen our network. We proactively leverage our internal capabilities through a dedicated architecture team that helps identify touchpoints throughout our businesses. We use these touchpoints to create organic growth opportunities that would otherwise not be recognized without the flywheel. We have had success moving our clients across the platform, increasing their monetization capacity and improving our growth.
Expand our Experiential Offering
 The concert, sports, and live entertainment categories have been increasingly prioritized over material goods by younger demographics. With a portfolio of hundreds of owned or managed events across Endeavor and 1,200 events and experiences curated by On Location, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these secular trends and create new offerings and investment opportunities. We continue to expand IMG Academy's campus footprint as well as its products and offerings, including the addition of virtual training and digital recruiting. 160over90's experiential marketing work on behalf of brands also taps into consumer demand for memorable experiences.
Invest in Adjacent High Growth Industry Segments
 We remain opportunistic and enter new, fast-growing industry segments where we are able to strategically leverage long-standing business partnerships and relevant commercial insights to accelerate scale. We invest to both complement our internal capabilities and enhance their value, as well as to enter relevant adjacent industry segments. Examples include sports gaming (IMG ARENA and OpenBet), streaming (Endeavor Streaming), experiential marketing (160over90), and partnerships with our clients (Talent Ventures).
Strategic Mergers and Acquisitions
 Our disciplined mergers and acquisitions strategy has been focused on investing in intellectual property and acquiring capabilities that can benefit from the Endeavor flywheel. In particular, we look for opportunities that move us further into ownership, enhance our portfolio of premium intellectual property, and bolster our flywheel and revenue upside in adjacent or existing core businesses. We have successfully completed more than 30 mergers and acquisitions since 2014. We will continue to make strategic deals that complement our internal capabilities and enhance the value of our network. We believe that a highly curated owned intellectual property asset base, diverse client mix, and global capabilities set further enhances the ecosystem connectivity that makes our platform the ideal home for numerous future acquisition targets that fit the profile of our investment strategy.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 We consider intellectual property to be very important to the operation of our business and to driving growth in our revenues, particularly with respect to professional engagements, sponsorships, licensing rights, and media distribution agreements. Our intellectual property includes the “Endeavor,” “WME,” “William Morris Endeavor,” “IMG,” “UFC,” and “PBR” brands in addition to the trademarks and copyrights associated with our content and events, and the rights to use the intellectual property of our commercial partners. Substantially all of our intellectual property and owned assets that we acquire are protected by trademarks and copyright, whether registered or unregistered.
Competition
 The entertainment, sports, and content industries in which we participate are highly competitive. We face competition from alternative providers of the services, content, and events we and our clients and owned assets offer and from other forms of entertainment and leisure activities.
 In our Events, Experiences & Rights segment, we face competition from other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, including competition from other companies in the media rights industry. In our Representation segment, we compete with other agencies that represent and/or manage clients including talent and brands. In our Owned Sports Properties segment, we face competition from sports leagues, associations, promotions, and events. For a discussion of risks relating to competition, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within the United States and internationally.”
 
Human Capital Resources
 
General
 We believe the strength of our workforce is critical to our long-term success. Endeavor’s human capital management objectives include attracting, retaining, and developing high performing and diverse talent and empowering them with our guiding principles of persistence, collaboration, excellence, and inclusion.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 employees in 36 countries, primarily in the U.S and EMEA, with a smaller presence in other regions, including APAC. We have invested and focused on the training and development of our employees, from both a personnel and technology perspective. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Talent Development
 Endeavor recognizes nurturing talent and embracing the constant evolution that leadership requires is crucial to our collective success. We have invested in learning and development opportunities that strengthen the role of leaders, as well as offering all employees opportunities for professional growth and skill development through access to a broad range of learning solutions on varying industry topics.
Diversity and Inclusion
 Endeavor strives to create a work environment that is more reflective of the diverse communities in which we work and to use our cultural influence to challenge methods and systems that result in inequity. The Company has established initiatives to address pressing societal issues through advocacy and action within our own walls and beyond. We recognize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) is intrinsically linked to business success and have established company-wide working groups and dedicated accountability teams of company leaders (vice president-level and above) to ensure ongoing progress is made.
To continue advancing our efforts to ensure our global workforce is more representative of our communities, we launched and/or expanded upon the following initiatives in 2022:
 •Created and distributed enhanced Diversity Accountability Dashboards, comprised of divisional representation metrics from each of our businesses, which are overseen by senior leaders across each business, along with an accompanying scorecard to help remain in line with overarching Endeavor-wide goals and commitments;
 •Enhanced a range of key recruitment practices, including formalizing our employee referral program to help limit patronage hiring; standardizing WME’s trainee recruitment program to ensure a fair and equitable selection process; and conducting substantial recruiting efforts among participants in our industry access programs, who are largely from historically excluded and/or underrepresented backgrounds;
 •Conducted Self-ID campaigns in the U.S. and U.K., allowing for current and new employees to self-identify based on race/ethnicity, gender-identity (inclusive of transgender identification), sexual orientation and more;
 •Trained Human Resources leaders on partnering with executives to accelerate diversity and inclusion efforts within their business and employee populations;
 •Held annual employee day of service, Walk the Walk, for the first year since the pandemic, with participation from more than 9,000 employees who participated in more than 30,000 volunteer hours;
 •Managed and grew seven Employee Resource Groups with 2,000+ employees across ten cities around the globe; and
 •Continued training programs in partnership with GLAAD, built to educate and familiarize employees with the LGBTQ+ experience and help enhance awareness and advocacy in the representation of LGBTQ+ talent, and Black Beauty Roster, educating agents and managers on the needs of Black talent on set.
 
Compensation and Benefits
 The objective of our compensation and benefits programs is to provide a total rewards package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward high-performing, qualified and skilled workforce necessary for our continued success across our diverse businesses. We seek to do this by linking compensation to company and business unit performance, as well each individual’s contributions to the results achieved. In addition to competitive base salaries, the company accomplishes this through annual cash-based bonus plans for eligible employees and long-term incentive plans for its executives.
 Endeavor is committed to providing comprehensive benefit programs that enhance the total well-being of our people – and their families – both in and outside of work. Our programs are designed to inspire our people to prosper physically, mentally, socially, and financially. Some examples of our wide ranging benefits offered include: health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, life insurance, disability/accident coverage, and mental health counseling and support.
 
Regulation and Legislation
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, and at the state level by athletic commissions, governing matters such as:
 •licensing laws for talent agencies, such as California’s Talent Agencies Act and the New York General Business Law;
 •licensing laws for athletes;
 •operation of our venues;
 •licensing, permitting, and zoning;
 •health, safety, and sanitation requirements;
 •the service of food and alcoholic beverages;
 •working conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship, immigration, visas, harassment and discrimination, and other labor and employment laws and regulations
 •our employment of youth workers and compliance with child labor laws;
 •compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "FCPA"), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the "Bribery Act") and similar regulations in other countries, as described in more detail below;
 •antitrust and fair competition;
 •data privacy and information security;
 •marketing activities;
 •environmental protection regulations;
 •imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, or currency exchange controls;
 •licensure and other regulatory requirement for the supply of sports betting data and software to gambling operators;
 •licensing laws for the promotion and operation of MMA events; and 
 •government regulation of the entertainment and sports industry.
 
We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental regulations, and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business.”
Many of the events produced or promoted by our businesses are presented in venues which are subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments in the jurisdictions in which the venues are located. These venues are also subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations and require a number of licenses in order for us to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses, and other authorizations. In addition, these venues are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the U.K.’s Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which require us to maintain certain accessibility features at each of the facilities. Lastly, these venues have been subject to federal and local restrictions from time to time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In various states in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and other permits or licenses for our athletes, and permits for UFC’s live events in order for us to promote and conduct those events. Generally, we or our employees hold promoters and matchmakers licenses to organize and hold UFC’s live events. We or our employees hold these licenses in a number of states, including California, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York.
We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which we operate, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act. These regulations make it illegal for us to pay, promise to pay, or receive money or anything of value to, or from, any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business. This ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute.
Our entertainment, sports, and content businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our web sites and mobile applications. We maintain various web sites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our businesses and offer merchandise and tickets for sale. The operation of these web sites and applications may be subject to a range of federal, state, and local laws.
Gaming regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and are administered by a regulatory agency with broad authority to interpret gaming regulations and to regulate gaming activities. Regulatory requirements vary among jurisdictions, but the majority of jurisdictions require licenses, permits, or findings of suitability for our company, individual officers, directors, major stockholders, and key employees. We believe we hold all of the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our business in this space, including IMG ARENA’s and OpenBet's business, which provides data technology and video for more than 45,000 sports events per year to sports betting platforms.
