ITEM 1. BUSINESS

First person pronouns used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to ICU Medical, Inc. (“ICU”) and its subsidiaries unless context requires otherwise.
Company Background and Overview of Business
ICU develops, manufactures and sells innovative medical products used in infusion therapy, vascular access, and vital care applications. ICU's product portfolio includes ambulatory, syringe, and large volume IV pumps and safety software; dedicated and non-dedicated IV sets, needlefree IV connectors, peripheral IV catheters, and sterile IV solutions; closed system transfer devices and pharmacy compounding systems; as well as a range of respiratory, anesthesia, patient monitoring, and temperature management products.
Headquartered in San Clemente, California, ICU was founded in 1984. Our primary customers are acute care hospitals, wholesalers, ambulatory clinics and alternate site facilities, such as outpatient clinics, home health care providers, and long-term care facilities. Since our inception we have grown organically and through acquisition.
In February 2017, we acquired Pfizer Inc.’s (“Pfizer”) Hospira Infusion Systems (“HIS”) business. The HIS acquisition complemented our legacy non-dedicated infusion sets and oncology business by expanding our product portfolio to include a complete intravenous infusion therapy product-line from IV solutions to IV pumps to non-dedicated infusion sets. 
In November 2019, we acquired Pursuit Vascular, Inc. (“Pursuit”). Pursuit was a privately-held medical device company with a primary focus on innovative catheter disinfecting products and technologies to reduce costly bloodstream infections and lower healthcare costs. Pursuit’s primary product is the ClearGuard® HD cap, which is used for the maintenance of hemodialysis catheters. 
In January 2022, we acquired Smiths Medical 2020 Limited (“Smiths Medical”), the holding company of Smiths Group plc’s global medical device business. The Smiths Medical acquisition complemented and broadened our preexisting product portfolio by adding syringe and ambulatory infusion devices, vascular access, and vital care products, and significantly strengthened and expanded our global market reach.
Products
As of December 31, 2022, our primary product offerings are listed below. Our product offerings related to our Smiths Medical acquisition are listed separately as we integrate that business.
Infusion Consumables
Infusion therapy sets, used in hospitals and ambulatory clinics, consist of a tube running from a bottle or plastic bag containing a solution to a catheter inserted in a patient’s vein, that may or may not be used with an IV pump. Closed System Transfer Devices (“CSTD”) and hazardous drug compounding systems are used to prepare and deliver hazardous IV medications such as those used in chemotherapy, which, if released, can have harmful effects to the healthcare worker and environment. Our primary products include:
•Clave™ needlefree products, including the MicroClave, MicroClave Clear, and NanoClave™ brand of connectors, accessories, extension and administration sets used for the administration of IV fluids and medications and the Neutron catheter patency device, used to help maintain patency of central venous catheters;
•ChemoLockTM CSTD, which utilizes a proprietary needlefree connection method, is used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. ChemoLock is used to limit the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, block the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury; and
•ChemoClaveTM, an ISO Connection standard and universally compatible CSTD used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. ChemoClave utilizes standard ISO luer locking connections, making it 
compatible with all brands of needlefree connectors and pump delivery systems. ChemoClave also is used to limit the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, block the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminate the risk of needlestick injury.
The preparation of hazardous drugs typically takes place in a pharmacy where drugs are removed from vials and prepared for delivery to a patient. Those prepared drugs are then transferred to a nursing unit where the chemotherapy is administered via an infusion pump set to a patient. Components of the ChemoClave and ChemoLock product lines are used both in pharmacies and on the nursing floors for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs.

Financial information relating to our reporting segment and primary product lines is set forth in Part II, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Manufacturing
Facilities

Our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in the United States, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Czech Republic. See Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We also rely on certain outside manufacturers for certain product lines in Infusion Systems and we leverage a long-term supply agreement with Pfizer (described below) to provide additional IV Solution products to us.
In 2017, we entered into two Manufacturing and Supply Agreements ("MSAs") with Pfizer under which, (i) Pfizer agreed to manufacture and supply us with certain agreed upon products for an initial five-year term with a one-time two-year option to extend and (ii) we agreed to manufacture and supply Pfizer certain agreed upon products for a term of five or ten years depending on the product, with a one-time two-year option to extend. The initial supply price under each MSA is annually updated and is in full consideration for all costs associated with the manufacture, documentation, packaging and certification of the products. In January 2021, we amended our MSA with Pfizer whereby we agreed to manufacture and supply certain agreed upon products to Pfizer. The amendment included a change to the term of the agreement to end on December 31, 2024 with Pfizer's unilateral election to extend through December 31, 2025. Other changes included (i) changes to our level of supply of products to Pfizer, (ii) certain changes to our manufacturing lines, (iii) updates to our supply price with added volume price tiers for annual periods and (iv) certain minimum purchase requirements for certain products. On February 1, 2022, effective as of January 1, 2022, upon our request, Pfizer executed a Product Addendum (the "Product Addendum") to our MSA agreement whereby Pfizer agreed to manufacture and supply to us certain agreed upon products subject to certain time and pricing terms and conditions. The Product Addendum expired on November 30, 2022.
We operate regional device service centers, in a number of locations, including Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., Sligo, Ireland; San Laurent, Quebec, Canada; Taipei, Taiwan and Rydalmere, Australia. See Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Raw Materials
We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a single supplier.We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by means of inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible.See Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are dependent on single and limited source third-party suppliers, which subjects our business and results of operations to risks of supplier business interruptions, and a loss or degradation in performance in our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
Sales, Marketing and Administration

We sell globally through our own direct sales force and through independent distributors. We currently serve customers in over 100 countries throughout the world. The majority of our sales is denominated in United States ("U.S.") dollars and we have sales denominated in Euros, Canadian dollars, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian dollars as well as other currencies. In 2022, we had worldwide net sales to Medline of 15% of consolidated net sales. In 2021 and 2020, we did not have sales over 10% to any single customer.
Distribution 
Our products are marketed and distributed in the U.S. and internationally to medical product manufacturers, independent distributors and directly to end users.
The distribution of our products in the U.S. is supported by a network of owned and leased distribution centers, which include King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California; Dallas, Texas and Olive Branch, Mississippi. We also utilize a number of public warehouses as part of our supply chain.
Internationally, we manage distribution by utilizing international regional hubs and through independent distributors.
Government Regulation

Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of drug products, medical devices and combination drug/device products in the U.S. to assure the safety and effectiveness of such medical products for their intended uses and otherwise meet the applicable requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”). The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") also regulates the advertising of our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny. 
Medical Device Regulation in the U.S.
The majority of our products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices in the U.S. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a pre-market notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a pre-market approval ("PMA") application. Under the FDC Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those that pose the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA's General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of current good manufacturing practices ("cGMPs") for medical devices known as the Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA's General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed into Class III.
Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to obtain from the FDA a 510(k) clearance for permission to commercially distribute the device. Class III devices require approval of a PMA application evidencing safety and effectiveness of the device.
Under the 510(k) process, applicants must demonstrate to the FDA that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, the "predicate" device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) pre-market notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") regulations. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to authorize the device for commercialization. If the FDA determines that the device is "not substantially equivalent," the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification request or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can 
review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination not to seek a new 510(k) or other form of marketing authorization for the modification to the 510(k)-cleared product, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained or a de novo classification is granted.
In the PMA application process, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDC Act to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA's review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel's recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers' or suppliers' facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement, or in some cases a new PMA. 
After a device is cleared or approved or otherwise authorized for marketing, numerous pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply unless explicitly exempt. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act that may present a risk to health;
•complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database;
•the FDA's recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Drug Regulation in the U.S. 
Certain of our IV solutions products are regulated by the FDA as drugs. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDC Act and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an institutional review board ("IRB") or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA") or abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") after completion of all required clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCPs"); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S.
Prior to beginning clinical trials of a drug product in the U.S., an IND must be submitted to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced and of select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter ("CRL"). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will generally describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a drug is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may include limitations on the indicated uses for which such drug may be marketed. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the drug’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the drug based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Any drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required 
to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Post-Market Enforcement in the U.S.
The FDA may withdraw marketing authorizations for drugs or medical devices if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things: complete withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, warning letters, untitled letters, clinical holds on clinical studies, refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, product seizures or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of products, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs, the issuance of corrective information, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and medical devices. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are cleared or approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the authorized label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
The European Union ("EU") has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the "EU Medical Devices Directive") which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the "EU Medical Devices Regulation"). Our current certificates have been granted under the EU Medical Devices Directive whose regime is described below. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire.
EU Medical Devices Directive
Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any 
claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product's technical dossiers and the manufacturers' quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the European Conformity ("CE") mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
EU Medical Devices Regulation
The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims to increase harmonization across the EU.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. 
Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier ("UDI") database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier ("UDI-DI") specific to a device, and a production identifier ("UDI-PI") to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions ("FSCAs") must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state of health or a serious public health threat. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical 
reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states' laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national "Sunshine Acts" which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the U.S., on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and, if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction, can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. 
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area ("EEA") which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Brexit
Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market according to the requirements provided in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) that sought to give effect to the three pre-existing EU directives governing active implantable medical devices, general medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules according to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the end of the United Kingdom's ("UK's") withdrawal from the EU ("Brexit") transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require all medical devices to be registered with the MHRA before being placed on the Great Britain market. The MHRA only registers devices where the manufacturer or their UK responsible person has a registered place of business in the UK. Beginning January 1, 2022, manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK responsible person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA.
On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. MHRA seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC), in particular to create a new access pathway to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform IVD regulation and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023, but have recently been postponed to July 2024. Devices bearing CE marks issued by EU notified bodies under the MDR or MDD are now subject to transitional arrangements. In its consultation response, the MHRA indicated that the future UK regulations will allow devices certified under the MDR to be placed on the market in Great Britain under the CE mark until either the certificate expires or for five years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Devices certified under the MDD could continue to be placed on the market until either the certificate expires or for three years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Following these transitional periods, it is expected that all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessed ("UKCA") mark. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary 
basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in the rest of the UK. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.
In addition, the trade deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.
Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland follows EU rules on medical devices and devices marketed in Northern Ireland require assessment according to the EU regulatory regime. Such assessment may be conducted by an EU notified body, in which case a CE mark is required before placing the device on the market in the EU or Northern Ireland. Alternatively, if a UK notified body conducts such assessment, a 'UKNI' mark is applied and the device may only be placed on the market in Northern Ireland and not the EU.
Manufacturing Regulation
We must also comply with FDA and International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") governing medical device manufacturing practices. The FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO require manufacturers to register and subject manufacturers to periodic FDA, state, foreign agencies and notified bodies and ISO inspections and audits of their manufacturing facilities. We are a FDA and ISO registered medical device manufacturer, and must demonstrate that we and our contract manufacturers comply with the FDA's QSR, cGMPs and similar foreign requirements. The FDA, other regulatory agencies and notified bodies outside the U.S. monitor compliance with these requirements through inspections and audits of manufacturing facilities. If an inspector observes conditions that might be violative, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily, or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace.
Other Healthcare Laws 
We are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 
•the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;
•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; 
•the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") information related to 
payments or other "transfers of value" made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician health care professionals (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; and
•analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to track and report information related to payments and other "transfers of value" to physicians and other healthcare providers or pricing, marketing expenditures and information. 
Violations of any of the laws described above include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of an entity’s operations, the debarment, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs and/or imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Our profitability and operations are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes in private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Our products are purchased by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs, private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services and products provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services and products from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customer purchase and the prices they are willing to pay since our products are not separately reimbursed by any third-party payor. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare services and products and challenging prices charged for healthcare services and products. 
Health Care Reform in the U.S.
In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical devices are used. For example, in March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was enacted through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act (the "ACA"), which, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or internationally, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Such legislation and regulation of healthcare costs may, however, result in decreased lower reimbursements by 
governmental and private payors to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
EU Healthcare Reform
 Additional healthcare reform measures in the EU may be adopted in the future as well. For instance, in December 2021, Regulation (EU) No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. This regulation which entered into force in January 2022 intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The regulation foresees a three-year transitional period and will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
Data Privacy and Security
Medical device companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign data privacy, security and data breach notification laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive. We believe our ability to effectively compete in this industry is determined by our ability to provide a wide breadth of cost-effective, high quality products. We believe the added breadth of our acquired product portfolios have increased our competitiveness as we can now provide a one-stop shop for customers and offer more flexible competitive pricing. We also believe our infusion pump product offering will enable us to achieve sales of a larger volume of higher margin infusion consumables, and we believe we have a wider customer reach through our unified distribution channels.
 Infusion Consumables
We believe that our ability to effectively compete in the Infusion Consumables market depends upon our ability to differentiate our products based on continued innovation, safety, quality, convenience, reliability, patent protection, ease of use and the pricing of our products, in addition to access to distribution channels. We encounter significant competition in this market both from global, large, established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies. We compete with products and systems marketed by Becton Dickinson ("BD"), Baxter International ("Baxter"), and B. Braun Medical, Inc. ("B. Braun"). Our CSTD products and systems, used for the preparation and safe handling of oncology drugs, compete with similar products from BD and EquaShield. We believe that our current CSTD product offering provides benefits over these competing systems in several areas related to safety, ease of use, quality, and cost; however, ongoing innovation will be required to remain competitive in this market space.
Infusion Systems (Legacy ICU and Smiths Medical)
We face strong global competitors in the Infusion Systems market. In the United States ("U.S.") our competitors include BD, Baxter, Moog Medical, Fresenius and B. Braun. Outside of the U.S., our primary competitors are BD, B. Braun, Fresenius Kabi, a division of Fresenius Group, and a large number of local market pump manufacturers. These competitors benefit from greater financial, research and development and marketing resources than we have. The smart pump market in recent years has been troubled with security concerns and product recalls. We believe our ability to effectively compete will be determined by our ability to build our brand strength using the development of technological advancements aimed at increasing the quality, reliability, safety and security of our pumps while at the same time focusing on manufacturing efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which are operationally challenging with evolving product lines.
IV Solutions
We participate in the IV solutions market only in the U.S. and Canada. Our primary competitors in the U.S. include Baxter and B. Braun. Demand for IV solutions is typically high and raw materials required to produce IV solutions are readily available. Our ability to compete will depend on our ability to maximize production, develop innovations in our product line, focus on cost-effectiveness and maintain the appropriate quality infrastructure.
Critical Care
Our primary competitor in Critical Care is Edwards Lifesciences.
Vascular Access-Smiths Medical
Our Vascular Access product line of Smiths Medical competes primarily with BD and B. Braun as well as Angio Dynamics, Greiner Bio-One and Teleflex Incorporated. Our ability to remain competitive in this market will depend on our ability to focus on demonstrable patient outcomes by differentiating our products by improving device functionality and by providing successful customer training programs on the use and maintenance of our products.
Vital Care-Smiths Medical
The Vital Care product line of Smiths Medical competes with numerous competitors due to its broad product portfolio. Those include multinational competitors such as Philips Healthcare as well as smaller more focused competitors such as Belmont and Intersurgical plc. Our ability to compete in this market will depend on our ability to continue to make technological advances to our products, thereby increasing customer efficiency, and provide product support aimed at improving clinical decision-making that ultimately enhances patient safety.
Patents

Many of our product lines rely on patent protection. We have obtained U.S. and foreign patents relating to certain of the technologies found in our products, and are pursuing additional patent applications. There is however, no single patent or group of patents that we own that we believe is material in relation to our business as a whole. 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. While we have obtained certain patents and applied for additional U.S. and foreign patents covering certain of our products, there is no assurance that the scope of any patent protection will prevent competitors from introducing similar or competing devices or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. We can also lose patent protection through expiration. The inability to obtain effective patent protection or the loss of patent protection on a specific product line could adversely affect our ability to exclude other company from producing effective competitive products. The loss of a significant portion of our patent portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
The fact that a patent is issued to us does not eliminate the possibility that patents owned by others may contain claims that are infringed by our products.

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Litigation, which would result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources, may be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Adverse determinations in such litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have initiated litigation, and may continue to initiate litigation in the future, to enforce our intellectual property rights against those we believe to be infringing on our patents.  Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources.

Seasonality/Quarterly Results

Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonal aspects. We can, however, experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers, which has been and may continue to be driven more by the COVID-19 pandemic surges and its impact on hospital admissions and procedure volumes along with production scheduling and customer inventory levels, as well as fluctuations due to supply constraints as a result of other macroeconomic 
and global geopolitical events, such as the conflict in the Ukraine. Our expenses do not typically fluctuate in the same manner as net sales, which may result in cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue.
Research and Development
We continue to invest in certain research and development ("R&D") projects to drive future growth and to remain competitive in our product lines. Our main R&D facilities are located in the U.S and India. Our R&D costs primarily include personnel costs and expenses related to the development of new products. Research and development costs were $93.0 million in 2022, $47.5 million in 2021 and $42.9 million in 2020.
Human Capital Management
We believe our employees are the foundation of our business and are key to executing our strategy globally. The knowledge, skills and abilities of our diverse workforce is paramount in upholding our mission of connecting patients and caregivers through safe, life-saving, life enhancing IV therapy products, systems, and services. 
We believe the health and well-being of our employees are cornerstones for our successful operations. Whether you are a machine operator in one of our manufacturing locations, a material handler in a distribution center, a service technician supporting our products in the field, or a clinician training customers on the use of our products in a hospital, we strive to prioritize the safety of our team members. This includes designing our work environments with a safety first mindset, providing personal protective equipment and safety training beginning day one.
Our ability to attract and retain talented individuals globally begins with our commitment to offer a career that gives people a unique opportunity to work in an exhilarating, fast-paced, inspiring, and collaborative environment where what they do makes a difference. We offer competitive salaries and benefit packages to all employees as well as select participation in incentive plans based on individual and company performance. 
We believe the development of our workforce is critical for personal growth and the success of our company as well. We reinforce this with challenging, yet rewarding assignments, continued learning and training programs through our global iLearning platform, and support continued education globally through tuition reimbursement programs. Our team believes in diversity, collaboration, and removing barriers to communication—all to create an environment where innovation and creativity can flourish. This is principal for us in attracting, developing, retaining and rewarding talent on a global scale. 
Finally, we believe that our leadership team, with its broad, and deep category knowledge and averaging approximately 22 years of experience in IV therapy has the necessary experience to effectively lead the execution of our strategy. 
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 14,500 employees located in over 35 countries.
