Overview
 Clearwater brings transparency to the opaque world of investment accounting and analytics with what we believe is the industry’s most trusted and innovative single instance, multi-tenant technology platform. Our cloud-native software allows clients to radically simplify their investment accounting operations, enabling them to focus on higher-value business functions such as asset allocation strategy and investment selection. Our platform provides comprehensive accounting, data and advanced analytics as well as highly-configurable reporting for global investment assets daily or on-demand, instead of weekly or monthly. We give our clients confidence that they are making the most informed decisions about investment performance, regulatory compliance and risk.
 We provide investment accounting and reporting, performance measurement, compliance monitoring and risk analytics solutions for asset managers, insurance companies and large corporations. Every day, Clearwater’s powerful platform aggregates and normalizes data on over $6.4 trillion of global invested assets for over 1,200 clients. We bring modern software to an industry that has long been dominated by difficult-to-use, high cost legacy technologies and processes, which often lack data integrity and traceability, and often require significant manual intervention. The strength of our platform is demonstrated by our approximately 80% win rate for new clients over the prior five years in deals that reached the proposal stage.
 The markets we serve are highly complex and changing rapidly. All asset owners and asset managers need timely, accurate and comprehensive information about their investment portfolios in order to effectively make capital allocation decisions, manage risk, measure performance, comply with regulations and communicate to various stakeholders internally and externally. This requires organizations to have a comprehensive, global view of their investment portfolio. A partial view of one asset class or one reporting regime is ineffective: delivering analysis on 95% of the portfolio is inadequate because, more often than not, the opaque final 5% of the portfolio creates disproportionate risk. A single client can invest in over 60 different asset classes, hold assets in over 40 different currencies, be governed by more than 10 accounting regimes and hold positions representing thousands of individual tax lots. These clients often have separate accounting, reporting, performance, compliance and risk management products for each asset class and each country. Furthermore, clients frequently require large teams of people to manually review, compare and enter data, correct errors and build custom reports across multiple disparate systems and spreadsheets. Our platform provides our clients with a single consolidated and transparent view of investment data and analytics.
 We believe that client demand for Clearwater’s offering continues to grow not only in the United States, but also in financial centers around the world. Prior to 2008, institutions often invested in a narrower range of asset classes for which legacy solutions may have been able to provide adequate accounting, performance measurement, compliance monitoring and risk analytics. Over the past decade, however, clients’ needs have grown meaningfully as a result of industry-wide trends such as:
 •globalization;
 •increased regulatory requirements and complexity;
 •higher investment allocations in alternative assets (such as private equity, hedge funds, and derivatives and structured services);
 •greater demand for timely risk management and transparency given economic, interest rate and geopolitical volatility, and
 •pressure to increase speed and accuracy while reducing cost.
 Clients no longer find it sufficient to review investment portfolios on a quarterly, monthly or even weekly basis. Their aged patchworks of on-premises software applications with multiple data warehouses and significant manual intervention expose them to time delays, a lack of data integrity and traceability, and a significant increase in errors, cost and ultimately risk. For many clients, this has become increasingly untenable.
 We allow our clients to replace these legacy systems with modern cloud-native software. Our platform helps clients reduce cost, time, errors and risk and allows them to reallocate resources to other value-creating activities. Our software aggregates, reconciles and validates data from more than 2,800 daily data feeds and more than four million securities that have been modeled across multiple currencies, asset classes and countries. This cleansed and validated data runs through our proprietary accounting, performance, compliance and risk solutions to provide clients with powerful analytics and daily or on-demand configurable reporting. We offer multi-asset class, multi-basis, multi-currency accounting and analytics that provide clients with a comprehensive view of their holdings and related performance. This allows our clients to make better, more timely decisions about their investment portfolios.


Clearwater benefits from powerful network effects. With our single instance, multi-tenant architecture, every client, whether new or existing, enriches our global data set by making it more complete and accurate. Our software continually sources, ingests, models, reconciles and validates the terms, conditions and features of every investment security held by all of our clients. This continuous process helps to create a single repository of comprehensive, accurate investment data (often referred to within the industry as a “Golden Copy” of data) that benefits all our clients to the extent they otherwise have rights to the data. Through this continuous process, we are able to identify and adjudicate data discrepancies that otherwise could introduce error and risk into our clients’ investment portfolios. We believe that a meaningful competitive advantage of this network effect is that we are increasingly seen as the best and most accurate source of investment accounting data and analytics in the industry.
 Our team members are passionate about client success. We strive to be an extension of our clients’ own teams by providing responsive, consistent and effective support. Our clients have direct access to a dedicated client service team, a specialized group of experts devoted to ensuring data is as accurate and current as possible and resolving any challenges our clients may encounter utilizing our platform. We take pride in our extremely high client satisfaction rating with a NPS of 60+, in contrast with competitors who typically score much lower. Our gross revenue retention rate has remained approximately 98% over the past sixteen quarters, which we believe is a testament to the strength of our offering, our ability to deliver operational efficiency for our clients and our focus on providing exceptional client service. We are able to deliver this service to our clients by attracting, retaining and engaging an outstanding team.
 We have a 100% recurring revenue model, excluding license related revenue from the JUMP acquisition. We charge our clients a fee that is primarily based on the amount of assets they manage on our platform, subject to contracted minimums. A majority of the assets on our platform are high-grade fixed income assets, leading to very low levels of volatility and highly predictable revenue streams. When applicable, we charge additional transaction fees for certain alternative asset classes (e.g., derivatives and other financial instruments). In 2022, we transitioned our contracting structure to a framework we describe as Base+ for all new clients. A Base+ contract framework includes a base fee for a prospective or existing client's book of business plus an incremental fee for increases in assets on the platform. This structure is designed to limit the downside volatility in our asset-based fees. We also began to amend contracts with our existing clients to either modify the structure of such contracts from a pure asset-based fee to this Base+ model or to increase the basis point price. Throughout 2022, 80% of our clients (based on percentage of annual recurring revenue) either modified their contracts to Base+ or agreed to price increases under their existing contracts. The Base+ model includes annual increases in the base fee and enables us to charge additional fees for supplemental services provided for certain alternative asset classes (e.g., LPx) or additional products (e.g. Prism, Performance Plus) should the client choose to utilize those services.
 Our Industry
 We operate in the investment accounting and analytics market, serving a range of clients that own or manage investment assets. Before the global financial crisis in 2008, the investment community generally invested in a relatively small number of asset classes that could be tracked with legacy software tools and processes. Over the ensuing years, the industry has faced several challenges that have strained and broken this fragmented and often manual approach to investment accounting operations. These new developments have included increasingly globalized holdings, growing regulatory complexities, the increasing prominence of complex alternative assets, and pressure to increase speed and accuracy while reducing cost. In light of these developments, asset owners and asset managers began to require a comprehensive, global view of their investment portfolios. These organizations initially reacted by buying dedicated products for each asset class, country and reporting regime, building proprietary data warehouses for different use cases, and increasing employee headcount in accounting and compliance functions. These practices resulted in investment accounting operations that were slow, expensive, inflexible and inconsistent, very often resulting in inaccurate data and reporting. We believe that our purpose-built single instance, multi-tenant technology platform provides clients with a vastly superior solution to their growing needs.
Increasingly Global Investment Portfolios
 Investors today increasingly hold positions in globally diversified assets as they search for yield and diversification. As a result, they require a global platform that delivers a multi-asset class, multi-basis, multi-currency solution across different accounting, reporting and regulatory regimes.
High Regulatory Complexity
 Increased regulatory requirements within the financial services and investment industries continue to proliferate in jurisdictions around the world, forcing asset owners and asset managers to adapt and operate under a myriad of ever-changing rules. The spread of these new regulations (e.g., CECL, NAIC, Solvency II, IFRS 9 and 17, and others) has been accompanied by a nearly six-fold increase in global yearly regulatory alerts and SEC enforcement actions, from approximately 10,000 alerts and enforcement actions in 2008 to approximately 64,000 in 2021, according to SEC press releases and annual reports. Investors must be responsive to ensure they remain compliant across this vast range of regulations. Failure to do so could lead to investigations and sanctions. Asset owners and asset managers need a robust and dynamic solution to help them achieve and maintain compliance in this complex and ever-evolving environment.
Growing Importance of Alternative Assets
 Investors are increasingly allocating capital to alternative assets and complex financial instruments as part of a search for higher investment returns and returns that are uncorrelated to equity and fixed income markets. According to a Preqin study from November 2020, investors expect to further increase their allocation to alternative assets over the coming years, particularly within private equity and debt. Alternative assets are typically traded less broadly and frequently than traditional investment assets (such as stocks, corporate bonds, treasury securities, currencies, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) and often have less data readily available about them. This complicates reporting and risk management. Asset owners and asset managers need comprehensive, accurate and timely data regardless of the complexity of their investment holdings.
Rising Demand for Risk Management and Transparency
 Investors are seeking the highest quality investment data and portfolio visibility in order to effectively make capital allocation decisions, manage risk and measure performance. Additionally, the rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives in investing has increased the need for transparency in portfolio holdings as investors seek to measure compliance with ESG objectives. Asset owners and asset managers need a solution that provides on-demand transparency in order to optimize risk management and provide their stakeholders with the holdings-based visibility that they require.
Pressure to Increase Efficiency
 The asset management industry is highly competitive and asset management firms must constantly improve operating efficiency to maintain profitability. Accounting teams at these firms are continually asked to meet growing regulatory and reporting challenges with fewer resources, an ultimately unsolvable problem with legacy products and processes. Additionally, the growing prominence of passive investment strategies (e.g., through the use of Exchange Traded Funds and Index strategies) has compressed fees for active asset managers and led to a greater focus on managing overall organizational costs to maintain profitability and operational efficiency. In order to effectively compete, asset owners and asset managers need modern automated solutions that reduce the need for greater headcount, and ultimately lower costs.
Digital Transformation from Legacy Technologies
 Many of the challenges that plague asset owners and asset managers result from their reliance upon legacy software products and outdated manual processes. These products typically require on-premises deployments, feature poor system flexibility and data management capabilities, and result in higher total costs of ownership. Asset owners and asset managers are seeking cloud-based solutions that address the costly, manual and error-prone deficiencies of these legacy technologies.
Our Value Proposition
 Clearwater’s purpose-built single instance, multi-tenant technology platform helps clients around the world radically simplify their investment accounting and reporting, performance measurement, compliance monitoring and risk analytics. Our solutions provide our clients with a comprehensive view and single source of truth for their investment portfolios and we believe our solutions deliver unmatched levels of speed, flexibility, traceability, repeatability and auditability, all with no manual labor required of our clients. Some key aspects of our value proposition include:
 •Single Instance, Multi-Tenant Platform: Clearwater’s platform is purpose-built, 100% in the cloud. The single instance, multi-tenant architecture allows for efficient and continuous upgrades, new features, and updates to adjust for rapidly evolving industry requirements and regulations. Each upgrade and update is made available worldwide.


•Comprehensive View of Global Assets: For asset owners and asset managers, we provide comprehensive views and powerful analytics regarding their investment data. We offer investment accounting for $6.4 trillion of assets in our clients’ portfolios globally as of December 31, 2022, including complex derivatives and alternative investments. Clients benefit from having a “single pane of glass” through which to holistically and accurately view their entire investment portfolios, with the flexibility to respond to unique reporting challenges across different regulatory regimes.
 •Single Source of Truth for All Accounting, Risk, Compliance and Regulatory Reporting: We completely eliminate the need for clients to manually process and reconcile data from different sources and systems. By leveraging machine learning, automation and our direct connections with approximately 1,000 custodians, more than 1,400 managers, more than 400 trading data sources and all of the leading third-party market data providers, our platform automates data aggregation, data reconciliation and data validation of each security in our clients’ investment portfolios. This allows us to deliver our clients data from a “Golden Copy” that is accurate, auditable and traceable.
 •Radical Simplification of Investment Accounting Operations: We deliver our clients a single, comprehensive platform that allows them to perform investment accounting, performance measurement, compliance monitoring and risk analytics. By eliminating the need for our clients to aggregate, reconcile and validate security data, we greatly simplify and expedite their operations, allowing them to quickly close their books, comply with regulatory reporting requirements, reduce costs and free their time to focus on managing their portfolios and performing other higher-value functions.
 •Accurate, Timely and Up-to-date Reporting: We offer transparent, and configurable views of our clients’ portfolios, accessible anytime from anywhere. Additionally, we are committed to frequent and seamless incorporation of new features and functionalities on our platform to meet the evolving business needs of our clients and the latest regulatory demands. For example, our clients can switch from a GAAP view to a Tax view to a STAT view, all in a matter of seconds.
 •Powerful Network Effects: Every incremental data source from an additional client improves our global data set by making it more complete and accurate for other clients on our platform that are similarly entitled to access such data. Our clients include a number of the leading financial institutions and corporations in the world, and by continually sourcing, ingesting, modeling, reconciling and validating the terms, conditions and features of every investment security held by all of our clients, we create a single repository of comprehensive, accurate investment data that serves to the benefit of other clients. This allows us to identify and adjudicate data discrepancies that otherwise could introduce error and risk into our clients’ investment portfolios. Furthermore, our clients’ analytical needs help us to continue driving best-in-class innovation with our offering. Our single-instance, multi-tenant platform allows us to take full advantage of these innovations as new Clearwater features and functions targeting any client’s needs become immediately available to the entire Clearwater client base. In effect, each client benefits from the breadth of holdings, and the demands and needs of, all other Clearwater clients. We believe that this provides Clearwater with a meaningful competitive advantage because we are increasingly seen as the best and most accurate source of investment accounting data and analytics in the industry.
 Our Platform
 Our purpose-built single instance, multi-tenant technology platform simplifies our clients’ investment accounting and reporting, performance measurement, compliance monitoring and risk analytics infrastructure and workflow. Our software automates data aggregation, data reconciliation and data validation of each security in our clients’ investment portfolios. This creates a fully reconciled “Golden Copy” of investment portfolio data, which can be trusted for accurate reporting and analytics. Our clients benefit from having a comprehensive “single pane of glass” view for daily visibility into all investment data and analytics. Our platform often allows clients to eliminate multiple legacy products and systems as well as significant manual labor. Approximately 91% of portfolios are automatically validated, reconciled and processed without further intervention. The remaining 9% of accounts are flagged for further analysis and reconciled by our reconciliation team.
 In order to deliver these powerful solutions and benefits, we purpose-built our technology stack to efficiently process millions of daily transactions in a highly scalable and efficient manner. Our platform is built on a single code base and eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming patches and upgrades across multiple, disparate software instances. As new features are developed and deployed, they are made available to all clients. Our system leverages the latest machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to ingest both structured and unstructured data that is transformed into a universal security model that enables network benefits for our clients.
 Our clients access the platform through a web-based interface that is highly configurable and provides a set of tools that enable our clients to derive actionable insights on a daily basis. This allows our clients to view their portfolio data from anywhere with an internet connection. Our intuitive, easy-to-use website allows users to view high-level portfolio information and quickly drill into portfolio specifics down to the most granular security level. Our platform also creates automated feeds to other client systems—such as trade order management systems, data warehouses, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and others—eliminating the need for clients to manually enter data from Clearwater’s solution into other client systems.


Our Solutions
 Our solutions are offered through one unified Clearwater platform and are detailed below:
 •Investment Accounting and Reporting: Our accounting solution was built with the flexibility to offer operational and regulatory accounting, from the simple to the complex, on the same platform. Our solution is comprehensive in its capabilities:
 •Multi-asset class: We have differentiated global asset class coverage including fixed income, equities, bank loans, commercial and residential mortgages, private capital markets (e.g., general and limited partnerships), derivatives and various other alternative assets;
 •Multi-basis: A single client can access 15 accounting bases, such as GAAP, Statutory, Tax and IFRS. Our platform has the flexibility to add new accounting bases as our clients’ needs require; and
 •Multi-currency: We support clients with more than 40 local currencies (currency of the country they are domiciled in), 10 functional currencies (currency of the country where their principal business is), and numerous reporting currencies.
 Our platform offers flexible configurations and outputs, customized general ledger entries for multiple accounting bases, and regulatory completeness. A suite of standardized reports automates relevant investment-related disclosures such as Fair Value Hierarchy and Level 3 Roll-forward and can be easily configured to provide the detailed accounting information investment accountants and internal stakeholders need. Our daily reconciliation, flexible reporting and general ledger capabilities ensure that period-end close processes are efficient and accurate.
 •Performance Measurement: Our solution enables investors to compare separate accounts, set custom benchmarks and track the overall performance of their portfolios. Custom performance reports and return calculations are available and designed to meet applicable GIPS calculation standards for investment managers. Users can drill down into the underlying performance return data at the lot level and track performance attribution per portfolio. 
 •Compliance Monitoring: Our users can set custom rules to monitor compliance according to their investment policies and standard applicable regulations. All investment activity is checked against those rules as often as a client requires and tracked at the security level. Compliance can be tracked across multiple policies, and notifications are automatically sent if there is a violation. Any compliance policy changes or resolutions can also be documented and referenced for internal audits.
 •Risk Analytics: We offer insightful risk analytics to ensure investors have access to their portfolios’ exposure every day. Our risk monitoring solution provides access to critical financial and investment portfolio risk information, so users are able to quickly answer pressing risk-related questions, including exposures by issuer, currency, country, duration, credit rating and more. Users can also view benchmark comparisons and analyze other risk factors, including cash flow forecasting, credit events, shock analysis, value at risk (VaR), and historical trends and exposures.
 Clearwater Prism
 As asset managers and asset owners continue to digitize their operating model and drive towards a data-driven business model, they are faced with a myriad of legacy infrastructure and disparate data sources. Additionally, user demand for more seamless access to their data and deeper transparency, is creating an urgent need for aggregation and reporting that provides a comprehensive view of investment information in a single-pane-of-glass, incorporating third party investment-related information not tied to Clearwater performing accounting-related functions.
 Our Clearwater Prism solution is a modular, SaaS-based data and reporting platform for investment data. Built on a cloud-native stack, it enables data ingestion, transformation, and reporting across all asset classes. These capabilities are delivered using a range of product modules namely Prism Reporting and Statements, Prism Connectors, Prism Data Ops and Prism Managed Services.
•Prism Reporting and Statements is a web-based client reporting and statement generation module that enables asset managers to create pixel-perfect client books and statements.
 •Prism Connectors is a set of ready-made adapters to vendor- and proprietary platforms to ingest investment-related information.
 •Prism DataOps is a data engineering platform that allows self-serve, user-defined data management including maintaining data taxonomy, lineage and transformation of investment-related information.
 •Prism Managed Services is a modular service that provides clients with professional support services for maintaining and extending their data feeds and reports.


The application of these modules extend into various use cases, including aggregating external data with accounting data generated by the Clearwater platform, enabling the efficient processing of private markets data using the Clearwater LPx and Clearwater LPx Clarity products to provide a deep and unparalleled level of transparency and connectivity with other data sets, such as ESG data.
 JUMP
 We acquired JUMP in November 2022 in furtherance of our growth strategy of expanding internationally and entering into adjacent markets, offering adjacent functionality for the “Full Investment Lifecycle” and evolving into a multi-product company. JUMP provides us with significant expansion in European markets and increases our capabilities through unit-linked funds functionality to serve European insurers which have assets in unit-linked funds. With JUMP, we have additional capabilities providing a modular front, middle and back office solution to investment managers, private banks, and insurers which we have grouped into the following offerings:
 •Portfolio management and order management
 •Performance
 •Unit-linked funds
 •Full trade life cycle
The enhanced capabilities acquired from JUMP are complemented by our add on modules for Alternative Assets, Clearwater Prism, Multi-GAAP and Self-Service. The acquisition expands our offerings globally for our existing clients and we believe it opens a new addressable market for our business.
Our Clients
 Clearwater serves a broad universe of institutional clients across multiple end-markets. Today, our largest client end-markets are asset management, insurance and corporate treasury. We are also growing our client base in the public sector with numerous state and local governments. While these end-markets and their clients can be quite different from each other, ultimately all of our clients need timely, accurate and comprehensive information on their investments in order to effectively make capital allocation and portfolio decisions, manage risk, measure performance, comply with regulations and communicate to various stakeholders both internally and externally. Chief Financial Officers, treasurers, controllers and Chief Operating Officers select our platform to deliver a holistic solution consisting of data aggregation, accounting book of record (ABOR), multi-basis reporting, powerful analytical tools and other key features.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had over 1,200 clients across 39 countries with over $6.4 trillion of global invested assets on our platform. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had 67 clients who contributed at least $1,000,000 in annualized recurring revenue. Our diversified, blue-chip client base of insurance companies, asset managers and large corporations have $3.1 trillion, $1.9 trillion and $1.0 trillion in assets on our platform, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. In addition, SLED (state, local and education) entities, and bank/ community foundations have $0.2 trillion and $0.2 trillion in assets on our platform, respectively as of December 31, 2022. No client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and our top 10 clients represented less than 30% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
 Our Go-to-Market Strategy
 We seek to deliver exceptional innovation and service to our clients every day. Client success is core to our go-to-market approach and contributes to both our ability to win new clients and retain existing clients.
 We have earned an NPS of 60+ in an industry that typically scores much lower. Our high client satisfaction also translates into gross revenue retention rates of approximately 98% over the prior sixteen quarters. From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022, client partners and client referrals, taken together, generated approximately one quarter of our closed deals on a total revenue basis.
 As we continue to see significant demand for our offerings around the world, we have also grown our sales force to 135 team members globally as of December 31, 2022. We divide this sales force by geography, client end-market and target client size. Our North American sales team includes representatives focused on insurance companies, asset managers, corporations and growth markets. Our international sales team includes representatives focused on insurers and asset managers based in various regions of Europe and APAC. We plan to continue expanding our sales force and adding new target end-markets in the periods ahead.
 Our sales force is supported by a global marketing team with 25 team members. We actively grow our sales pipeline through account-based marketing, investment in our digital presence, increased brand awareness and product marketing. We will continue to invest in and build out our global marketing function to drive future pipeline and growth.


Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to drive the growth of our business and expand our addressable market through the following strategies:
 Deepen Our Relationships With Existing Clients
 We believe we achieve our industry-leading NPS of 60+ by giving our clients an exceptional and differentiated solution and experience. We believe we are very effective in solving our clients’ challenges in managing investment accounting and reporting, performance measurement, compliance monitoring and risk analytics. Our gross revenue retention rate over the last sixteen quarters has averaged 98%, and our net revenue retention rate reached 106% in the quarter ending December 31, 2022. For a discussion of gross revenue retention rate and net revenue retention rate, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Measures.”
 We actively seek to strengthen and deepen our client relationships through our client engagement model, which is a set of best practices aimed at increasing client satisfaction, engagement and share of wallet. We conduct quarterly steering committee meetings with key client stakeholders and senior members of Clearwater management and have semi-annual on-site visits to review key client’s business needs, market feedback, our product roadmap and improvement opportunities. We believe that our relentless focus on client success and innovation will continue to result in strong client retention and allow us to grow as our clients grow.
 Continue Expanding Within Our Core Client End-Markets
 Our current core end-markets (asset management, insurance and corporations) remain significantly unpenetrated today. We continue to drive growth and market-share gains within these end-markets, which have to date been primarily served by legacy products and processes. We will continue to displace legacy products and add clients in these end-markets through our direct sales and marketing efforts and by helping our strategic asset manager clients win new clients, which in turn brings more assets onto our platform. With only approximately 4% market penetration for asset managers and approximately 31% for insurance companies in North America today, we believe that we have significant market opportunity for additional growth. Our competitive win rates for new clients remains approximately 80% over the prior five years in deals that reached the proposal stage, which gives us confidence that our approach works well.
Accelerate International Expansion
 With new offices, leadership and sales teams now established in Europe and APAC (Asia-Pacific), we are poised to reach more new clients globally moving forward. We have substantial room to grow our international business as during the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues outside North America represented only 8% of our total revenues, despite these markets representing approximately 46% of our total addressable market. We have invested in these geographic markets recognizing that the challenges international clients experience are very similar to those experienced by our North American clients. We believe our solution is highly effective at addressing client needs regardless of geography.
Continue Expanding Within Adjacent Client End-Markets
 We believe there is a significant opportunity for growth by continuing to target adjacent end-markets. There is a large opportunity to tailor the regulatory reporting and performance management capabilities of our existing solutions to better serve the needs of a range of additional asset owners, such as state and local governments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and a variety of alternative asset managers. We believe our existing solutions are suitable to serve the needs of the clients in these end-markets and the acquisition of JUMP strengthens these capabilities. While we have onboarded our first clients in these end-markets and have built internal teams to service them, we do not currently derive a material amount of revenue from these end-markets.
Innovate and Develop Adjacent Solutions
 Clearwater has a long history of innovating and advancing our platform based on client feedback and evolving market needs. We will continue to invest heavily in expanding our functional breadth and depth, improving user experience, increasing automation and strengthening system performance. We intend to utilize emerging technologies including machine learning and robotic process automation to continue driving industry-leading capabilities and performance, keeping the platform at the very forefront of technology. Historically, we have sold our solutions as one unified offering. As clients have continued to find innovative uses for our platform in other business functions, we expect to sell and price those newer modules separately. Examples of our adjacent solutions that we have developed include Clearwater Prism and Clearwater LPx, which we believe help solve the investment reporting needs of our clients. Clearwater LPx is an investment data platform dedicated to streamlining the accounting process for limited partnerships. Clearwater clients leverage the automated solution to enable significant efficiency gains and solve the operational challenges associated with data aggregation, reconciliation, commitment tracking, document storage, accounting, and reporting. Clients are using Clearwater LPx to gain a full picture of all of their limited partnerships and to automate their NAIC reporting.
Pursue Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions
 We may selectively pursue partnerships and acquisitions that complement our solutions, provide us access to new markets or improve our competitive positioning within existing and new markets, or that otherwise accelerate one or more of our growth objectives. We completed the acquisition of JUMP in November 2022, which has expanded our capabilities in investment management and operations with a complete front-to-back end solution and provides significant expansion into European markets. We will continue to consider similar partnerships and acquisitions focused on improving our technology for alternative assets data and our performance and risk management offerings, as well as expansion in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Competition
 The market for investment accounting and analytics is competitive and highly fragmented. The market is served by large-scale players with broad offerings as well as vendors with only point solutions that target local markets or specific client types, business functions or asset classes. We also face competition from systems developed and serviced internally by our potential clients’ IT departments. We believe that there are currently no competitors who offer a cloud-native platform like ours. We further believe that our solution is more comprehensive than our competitors’ in terms of asset class coverage and functionality. Our competitors primarily utilize legacy, on-premises systems and often employ large operational teams. While some of our competitors may take components or versions of their offerings into the cloud, their core platforms remain underpinned by legacy technologies, making it virtually impossible to ensure consistency, timeliness and auditability.
 In each of our core client end-markets, we compete with a variety of firms depending on client size, type, location, computing environment and functional requirements. Our principal competitors include large providers of investment operations, accounting and analytics systems such as SS&C (with its Advent, Camra, Maximus, and Singularity products), State Street (with its PAM and outsourced service offerings), SAP, BNY Mellon’s Eagle product, Simcorp’s Dimension, BlackRock’s Aladdin, FIS’s iWorks and Northern Trust. We occasionally see smaller providers of specialized applications and services. We also compete with outsourcers, as well as the internal processing and IT departments of our prospective clients.
 We believe the principal factors that drive competition in our market include:
 •Comprehensive accounting and reporting of global assets on a daily basis;
 •Ability to provide a "Golden Copy" / single source of data truth in order to ensure data consistency across all business applications;
 •Breadth and quality of solutions;
 •Technology differentiation, including single instance, multi-tenant architecture;
 •Automated data aggregation and reconciliation capabilities;
 •Flexible and integrated reporting;
 •Daily and on-demand visibility into investment performance;
 •Quality of client service;
 •Reputation with other leading financial institutions and clients;
 •Frequent and complete regulatory updates;
 •Simplified IT infrastructure and operating costs;


•Scalability, including handling large changes in assets (e.g., M&A);
 •Ease of use and quality of user interface; and 
 •The price of such offerings and return on investment.
 Product Development & Engineering
 Our product development and engineering teams are focused on extending our market leadership by innovating on both our existing and new solutions. We believe we must pursue relentless and aggressive innovation to maintain our competitive advantage. To meet these goals, we use multidisciplinary teams of highly trained personnel and leverage their expertise across our solutions. We have invested heavily in our product development and engineering teams to ensure a high degree of product functionality and quality.
 Our product and engineering management team focuses on near-term and long-term product strategy, identifying and implementing best practices, continual improvement in engineering throughput and quality, integration strategies across third-party products, and continued process automation.
 Approximately 35% of our global employee base is dedicated to product development and engineering. Our personnel are organized into solution-specific teams and are based principally in Boise, Idaho, Seattle, Washington and Noida, India. We expect to continue our significant investment in product engineering and innovation as we extend our competitive strengths moving forward.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures, technical measures and contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property. We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information.
 We enter into confidentiality agreements and/or license agreements with our employees, consultants, clients and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements. We have proprietary know-how in our algorithms, business on-boarding functions and software applications. We have in the past and may in the future pursue patents covering our proprietary technology. We also pursue the registration of certain of our trademarks and service marks in the United States. We have registered the mark “Clearwater” with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business. We have established a system of security measures to protect our computer systems from security breaches and computer viruses, including various technology and process-based methods, such as clustered and multi-level firewalls, intrusion detection mechanisms, vulnerability assessments, content filtering, antivirus software and access control mechanisms. We also use encryption techniques for data transmissions. We control and limit access to confidential and proprietary information on a “need to know” basis.
 In October 2022, Clearwater was granted its first patent from the United States Patent Office (Patent No.: US 11,475,078 B2). The invention relates to identifying Application Programming Interface (“API”) endpoints and the information required to use the endpoints in a software environment. By “crawling” the environment, the invention can identify API functions and web services available in the environment. The invention also allows users to search for specific functionality, or the use of certain data or information, to find specific web services, and eliminate the need to manually search through each function in the API to find the “best” function for the situation.
 Regulations
 As with any company operating in our field, we are subject to a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently evolving. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. This ambiguity includes laws and regulations possibly affecting our business, such as those related to data protection. Changes to such laws and regulations could cause us to incur additional costs and change our practices in order to comply.
Data Protection and Privacy
 Users of our solutions and services are located in the United States and around the world. As a result, we may collect and store the personal information of individuals who live in many different countries. Accordingly, we may be subject to those countries’ privacy laws and the jurisdiction of such regulators by collecting or storing the personal data of those countries’ residents, even if we have no physical or legal presence there. Our exposure to foreign countries’ privacy and data security laws may impact our ability to collect and use personal information, increase our legal compliance costs and expose us to liability.


We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Increased domestic or international regulation of data utilization and distribution practices could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we primarily process institutional financial information, we could face liability related to unauthorized access to, disclosure or theft of the personal information we store and process, and could consequently incur significant costs.
 Anti-Corruption and Sanctions
 We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, which may include, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the USA PATRIOT Act and other applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe our relationship with our employees to be good.
 We have a team-oriented culture and encourage candor from our employees, which we believe helps us to succeed and drive operational excellence. We also seek to, and have a history of, promoting from within our organization as well as hiring top talent from outside of our company to expand our capabilities.
 We aim to hire individuals who share our passion, commitment and entrepreneurial spirit. We are also committed to diversity and inclusion because we believe that diversity leads to better outcomes for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of our clients. We recognize the importance of diversity in leadership roles within our company.
 We encourage our employees to operate by a common set of values, which includes being:
 •Infectiously passionate about Clearwater;
 •Intensely committed to our clients;
 •Devoted to building an outstanding, engaged team;

 ESG
 Clearwater is focused on ESG objectives to create long-term value and manage risks, as well as to seek to positively impact our community through both company and employee efforts. Clearwater has recently, with the aid of a well-known consulting firm, completed an ESG materiality assessment and identified the following ESG priorities:
 •Environmental: renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions, climate risk and action, responsible sourcing and procurement;
 •Social: diversity, equity and inclusion, community engagement and responsible products and offerings; and
 •Governance: data privacy, corporate governance, ethics and anti-corruption and risk management


Clearwater has a number of on-going initiatives and has demonstrated progress in several of these areas, including offering employee benefits that promote responsible transportation, volunteerism and charitable contributions, transitioning to a cloud-based server provider, prioritizing board diversity with a Board of Directors that is 60% comprised of women, racial and ethnic minority and LGBTQ+ directors. Clearwater has also instituted leading information security practices to meet the high security expectations of its client base.
Clearwater is particularly proud of Clearwater Cares, our corporate social responsibility program, through which we have worked with our employees to identify three company-wide priorities: science, technology, engineering and mathematics (“STEM”) education, human services and sustainability. For example, in Boise, Idaho, employees volunteered at an Hour of Code event and Clearwater donated funds for classroom tools for robotics and game design. Clearwater has also donated to food drives in Boise, Idaho, Edinburgh, Scotland and Noida, India. We have partnered with the Salma Public School in Uttar Pradesh, India, where employees have participated in interactive learning sessions, sports days and other activities. Employees there also worked with a local non-governmental agency to donate winter essentials to the underprivileged. We offer our employees 16 hours of paid time off to perform volunteer services and have matched employee donations to company identified charities.
