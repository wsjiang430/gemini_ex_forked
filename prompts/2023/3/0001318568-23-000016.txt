Overview 
Everi develops and offers products and services that provide gaming entertainment, improve our customers’ patron engagement, and help our casino customers operate their businesses more efficiently. We develop and supply entertaining game content, gaming machines and gaming systems and services for land-based and iGaming operators. Everi is a provider of financial technology solutions that power casino floors, improve operational efficiencies, and fulfill regulatory requirements. The Company also develops and supplies player loyalty tools and mobile-first applications that enhance patron engagement for our customers and venues in the casino, sports, entertainment, and hospitality industries.
Everi reports its financial performance, and organizes and manages its operations, across the following two business segments: (i) Games and (ii) Financial Technology Solutions (“FinTech”). 
Everi Games provides gaming operators with gaming technology and entertainment products and services, including: (i) gaming machines, primarily comprising Class II, Class III and Historic Horse Racing (“HHR”) slot machines placed under participation or fixed-fee lease arrangements or sold to casino customers; (ii) providing and maintaining the central determinant systems for the video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) installed in the State of New York and similar technology in certain tribal jurisdictions; and (iii) business-to-business (“B2B”) digital online gaming activities.
Everi FinTech provides gaming operators with financial technology products and services, including: (i) financial access and related services supporting digital, cashless and physical cash options across mobile, assisted and self-service channels; (ii) loyalty and marketing software and tools, regulatory and compliance (“RegTech”) software solutions, other information-related products and services, and hardware maintenance services; and (iii) associated casino patron self-service hardware that utilizes our financial access, software and other services.

Our solutions are secured using an end-to-end security suite to protect against cyber-related attacks allowing us to maintain appropriate levels of security. These solutions include: access to cash and cashless funding at gaming facilities via Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) debit withdrawals, credit card financial access transactions, and point of sale (“POS”) debit card purchases at casino cages, kiosk and mobile POS devices; accounts for the CashClub Wallet, check warranty services, self-service loyalty and fully integrated kiosk maintenance services; self-service loyalty tools and promotion management software; compliance, audit, and data software; casino credit data and reporting services; marketing and promotional offering subscription-based services; and other ancillary offerings. 
Impact of COVID-19, Macro-Economic Volatility and Global Instability, Employment Constraints and Supply Chain Disruptions
We continue to monitor the remaining effects of COVID-19 and believe we are prepared to respond appropriately to the extent additional variants surface that disrupt our business.
We have experienced an impact from macro-economic volatility as a result of inflation, interest rate movements and global instability, particularly as it relates to our supply chain, both from an upstream and downstream perspective, which impacts the delivery of our products; and we continue to evaluate the effects of interest rate movements on our variable rate debt and pricing pressures on our business. 
We have experienced an impact from employment constraints as a result of inflation that has significantly increased over prior years. This has placed pressure on competitive wages, which has led to increases in wages and other related costs.
We have experienced an impact from supply chain disruptions that have resulted in additional costs incurred to develop, produce, and ship our products.
For additional information on our segments and the revenues generated by our products and services see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” and “Note 18 — Segment Information” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Our Products and Services 
Everi Games 
Our products and services include electronic gaming devices, such as Native American Class II offerings and other electronic bingo products, Class III slot machines and HHR gaming machines placed under participation or fixed-fee lease arrangements, or sold to casino customers, B2B digital online gaming activities, accounting and central determinant systems, and other back-
office systems. We conduct our Games segment business based on results generated from the following major revenue streams: (i) Gaming Operations; and (ii) Gaming Equipment and Systems.
Gaming Operations
With respect to our Gaming operations revenue stream, we primarily provide: (i) leased gaming equipment, Class II, Class III and HHR offerings, on a revenue participation or a daily fixed-fee basis, including standard games and hardware and premium games and hardware, which include local-area progressive jackpot offerings and wide-area progressive (“WAP”) jackpot offerings; (ii) accounting and central determinant systems; and (iii) digital online gaming activities.
In connection with our leased gaming equipment, we retain ownership of the machines installed at customer facilities. We receive recurring revenue based on a percentage of the daily win per unit (i.e., cash/coin-in less patron win and jackpots paid) generated by the leased gaming equipment, a percentage of the total cash/coin-in, a daily fixed-fee based upon the number of gaming machines placed or a combination of these methods. We expect to continue to (i) increase our investment in research and development to innovate and introduce new gaming hardware and theme content; (ii) expand our offering of new standard and premium game hardware and theme content; and (iii) extend and expand our game placements into new gaming markets and additional jurisdictions. From our historical focus on game placements in the Oklahoma tribal market, Everi Games has diversified its installed base in recent years with entry into additional commercial and tribal markets. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 11,219 units, or 62.4% of the total installed base, were outside of the Oklahoma tribal market. Additionally, Everi Games has grown its premium game installations, with this portion of games representing approximately 49.0% of our total installed base as of December 31, 2022. 
In connection with our WAP offering, machines placed under such arrangements fall into the premium leased gaming equipment category and we retain ownership of such machines. Currently spanning multiple product lines, our WAP is offered to customers on the Player Classic, Skyline, Skyline Revolve, Core HDX Renegade, Empire MPX, Empire Flex and Empire DCX cabinets. 
Gaming operations also include revenues generated under our arrangement to provide the New York State Gaming Commission with a central determinant, monitoring, and accounting system for the VLTs in operation at licensed State of New York gaming facilities. In November 2019, a new agreement between Everi Games and the New York State Gaming Commission was approved and became effective on January 1, 2020. Under this agreement, Everi Games will provide and maintain the central determinant system for the New York Lottery through December 2029. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 17,000 VLTs connected to our central determinant system for the New York Lottery. Pursuant to our agreement with the New York State Gaming Commission, we receive a portion of the network-wide net win (generally, credits played less free pay allowances and prizes paid to patrons per day) in exchange for provision and maintenance of the central determinant system. We also provide the central determinant system technology to Native American tribes in other licensed jurisdictions, for which we receive a portion of the revenue generated from the VLTs that are connected to the system.
In connection with our digital online gaming activities, Everi provides our games to business customers, including both regulated real money and social casinos, which offer the games to consumers through their online gaming platforms. Everi has developed its own remote gaming server (“RGS”) that allows us to deliver a selection of games from our extensive library of land-based and internally developed content to our digital customers in a manner that allows for the game play features and functionality to operate in a manner similar to how these games were designed for our land-based customers. This RGS library contains casino-themed games available for real money gaming (“RMG”) that are offered to regulated online casinos that operate in the RMG regulated markets, and social games that are offered to our business customers that operate play-for-fun social casinos on their mobile apps and web sites. We enter into revenue share agreements with these online business customers. 
Gaming Equipment and Systems
Gaming equipment and systems revenues are derived from the sale of some combination of: (i) gaming equipment and player terminals; (ii) game content; (iii) license fees; and (iv) ancillary equipment, such as signage and lighting packages.

We conduct our FinTech segment business based on results generated from the following major revenue streams: (i) Financial Access Services; (ii) Software and Other; and (iii) Hardware. 
Financial Access Services
In connection with our Financial Access Services, we offer the following:
Funds Dispensed. Funds dispensed transactions represent the largest category of electronic payment transactions that we process, as measured by dollars processed and transaction volume. In a funds dispensed transaction, a patron directly accesses funds from either a standalone ATM or a device enabled with our funds dispensing service by using a debit card to withdraw funds from the patron’s demand deposit account, using a credit card to access the patron’s line of credit, or disbursing funds authorized by a third party through direct application programming interface integration. In any event, the patron must use the personal identification number (“PIN”) associated with such card or other accepted authentication method. Our system then routes the transaction request through an electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) network to the patron’s bank or card issuer, or through a third party system, as applicable. 
Depending on several factors, including the patron’s account balance, their credit limit and/or the daily withdrawal limits (which limits are often set by the card issuer), the card issuer will either authorize or decline the transaction. If the transaction is authorized, then the funds dispensing-enabled device dispenses the cash to the patron. For a transaction using a debit card, the patron’s demand deposit account is debited by the amount of cash disbursed plus a service fee that we assess the patron for the use of the funds dispensing service. For a transaction using a credit card with a PIN, the patron’s credit card account is charged by the amount of the cash disbursed plus service fees assessed by the Company and by the card issuer for the use of the funds dispensing service. In both cases, our service fee is currently a fixed dollar amount and not a percentage of the transaction size. We also receive a fee from the card issuer, which we refer to as the interchange reimbursement fee, for accommodating the card issuer’s customer (the patron). In most circumstances, we pay a percentage of the service fee received from the patron and, in many circumstances, a portion of the interchange reimbursement fees received from the card issuer, as a commission to our gaming operator customers for the right to operate on their premises.
Funds Transmitted. Everi products are also able to transmit funds to a patron’s external bank account or other approved account from physical devices such as our kiosks or via the CashClub Wallet. These funds may be sent via ACH, the debit card networks, or direct connections with third parties. In all cases, Everi will either charge a fee to the casino operator or share in revenue from the patron where fees are presented to them for the service.
Credit Card Financial Access Transactions and POS Debit Card Financial Access Transactions. Patrons can perform credit card financial access transactions and POS debit card financial access transactions using many of our enabled devices. A patron’s credit card financial access limit is usually a sub-limit of the total credit line and is set by the card issuer, not Everi. These limits vary significantly and can be larger or smaller than the POS debit financial access limit. A credit card financial access transaction obligates the patron to repay the card issuer over time on terms that are preset by the cardholder agreement. A patron’s POS debit card allows the patron to make cash withdrawals at the POS-enabled device in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of funds in the account, or a daily limit that is generally five to ten times as large as the patron’s daily ATM limit.
When a patron requests either a credit card or POS debit card financial access transaction, our processor routes the transaction request through one of the card associations, or EFT networks, to the card issuer. Depending upon several factors, such as the available credit or bank account balance, the transaction is either authorized or declined by the card issuer. If authorized, the patron’s bank account is debited or the patron’s credit card balance is increased, in both cases, by an amount equal to the funds requested plus our service fee. Our service fee is a fixed dollar amount, a percentage of the transaction size, or a combination of a fixed dollar amount and percentage of the transaction size. If the transaction is authorized, the device informs the patron that the transaction has been approved. The device then further instructs the patron to proceed to the gaming operator’s cashier cage (“financial services center”), to complete the transaction, because both credit card and POS debit card financial access transactions must, in most circumstances, be completed in a face-to-face environment and a unique signature received in order to comply with rules of the card associations. We receive the transaction amount and the service fee from the card issuer, and we reimburse the gaming operator for the cash amount that it provided to the patron, and in addition, will pay the gaming operator a portion of the service fee we collected as a commission for the right to operate on its premises. We are also obligated to pay interchange fees to the card issuer and processing costs related to the electronic payment transaction to card associations.
Check Warranty Services. Everi provides a check warranty service that allows gaming operators to accept personal and/or payroll checks without the risk of default. When a patron presents a check to the cashier at a gaming operator, the check and 
patron information is sent through Everi’s system to our third-party partner. The partner evaluates the information and returns to the cashier a warranty limit that a check or multiple checks can be cashed for on that business day. The partner may also return a decline code telling the cashier not to accept the check. 
For a gaming operator that subscribes to the check warranty service, Everi will warranty any dishonored check that was approved, eliminating any risk of loss on check acceptance for the gaming operator. Everi’s partner facilitates and manages the check processing, deposits, redeposits, and collections for any checks. 
On our behalf, our third-party provider charges our customers a fee for the check warranty services, which is typically a percentage of the face amount of the check being warranted. In such circumstances, we receive the check warranty revenue associated with the fees we charge our customers for the initial check warranty services. We are exposed to risk for the losses associated with warranted checks that cannot be collected from patrons issuing the items. Warranty expenses are defined as any amounts paid by the third-party provider to gaming operators to purchase dishonored checks that will not be collectible from patrons. We also pay certain fees and expenses to our third-party provider in connection with the provision of such services.
CashClub® is a software payments platform that provides gaming operators with a personal computer workstation software user interface and point-of-sale terminal that streamlines credit and debit card financial access transaction processing and check warranty transactions for casino patrons. It allows for electronic signature capture and dynamic currency conversion. Several mobile versions, such as CashClub Concierge, are also available that enable operators to serve their patrons when, where, and how they are needed. It also interfaces with our Everi Compliance solutions (defined below) to assist casino operators with meeting regulatory requirements under Title 31 of the Bank Secrecy Act.
CashClub Wallet® is a digital payments platform for gaming operators to offer their patrons a digital cashless method to fund their entertainment experience, including funding at the gaming device, payments at point of sale for retail, online, hotel and food/beverage, igaming, and sports wagering. The wallet allows patrons various funding options including credit card financial access transactions and POS debit card financial access transactions, Automated Clearing House, and E-Check check warranty. It also interfaces with our Everi Compliance solutions (defined below) to assist casino operators with meeting regulatory requirements under Title 31 of the Bank Secrecy Act. The wallet also has capabilities to integrate with our Loyalty platform including our Enrollment and Promotional kiosks. 
Software and Other
JackpotXpress is a full-featured jackpot payout and tax form management and filing platform that allows casino personnel to work through the complex jackpot process using a mobile tablet or kiosk. JackpotXpress allows gaming operators to reduce jackpot payout wait times, increase slot play, eliminate manually filling out cumbersome paper documents, and perform Know Your Customer (“KYC”) checks. It is fully integrated with our Everi Compliance, CageXchange, and JackpotXchange products. In addition to making jackpot operations more efficient, JackpotXpress also helps operators increase customer engagement which leads to improved loyalty and service.
Loyalty Platform provides a software platform that enables gaming operators to adopt and deliver new promotional strategies to attract, engage, reward, and retain their patrons. Gaming operators utilize the platform to deliver content and promotions on kiosks, tablets, and mobile devices. The software platform integrates with other casino applications to engage with patrons in a more relevant and personalized fashion. We provide the operators with a control panel to assist with the planning, personalization, and optimization of delivering messages and content via interactions within our platform depending on how much value the casino places on the patron. This allows our customers to unify the patron experience across all touchpoints within the casino and replaces outdated promotional and enrollment tactics by utilizing our content for promotions, drawings, targeted alerts, card signups, reprints, and geo-fencing. By providing a comprehensive set of integrated applications within our platform, we offer gaming operators the ease of use and simplicity to interact with their patrons. Additionally, our loyalty platform is integrated with other Everi applications for financial access and compliance tools.
Maintenance provides various levels of support and maintenance services for our fully integrated kiosks, loyalty kiosks, and related equipment. Our support operations, field service, and customer engagement teams provide quarterly and annual preventative maintenance on these products and software systems to help maximize the efficiency of our products.
Everi Compliance is a leading Anti-money Laundering (“AML”) management tool for the gaming industry. Everi Compliance encompasses many elements including filing Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”) and Currency Transaction Reports (“CTRs”), and assisting our customers in performing KYC activities. Everi Compliance automates much of the manual processes gaming operators employ to be compliant with those requirements, thus saving time, improving accuracy, and allowing operators to manage their compliance programs much more efficiently. In addition, Everi Compliance gives operators the ability to enter 
Multiple Transaction Log and Negotiable Instrument Log transactions, file Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) reports electronically, conduct transaction analysis, complete compliance audits, and review reports. 
Central Credit is our gaming patron credit bureau service which, on a subscription basis, allows gaming operators to improve their credit-granting decisions by obtaining access to a database containing credit information and transaction data on millions of gaming patrons. Our gaming credit reports comprise information recorded from patron credit histories at hundreds of gaming operators. We provide such information to gaming operators that subscribe to the service. These operators then use that data, among other things, to determine how much credit, if any, they will grant to a gaming patron. We typically charge our customers for access to gaming patron credit reports on a monthly basis and our fees are generally comprised of a fixed minimum amount plus per-transaction charges for certain requests.
Hardware
Fully Integrated Kiosks are a complete line of products that provide multiple functions to gaming operators on their casino floors. This includes financial access functionality that enables funds dispensed cash withdrawals, POS debit card and credit card financial access transactions directly or by using our patented “Seamless Transition” technology, which is the Europay, MasterCard, and Visa global standard for cards equipped with security chip technology (“EMV”). The kiosks also provide functionality to perform check cashing transactions, slot machine ticket redemption, bill breaking, slot ticket purchase from a debit card, and loyalty program access, as well as integration with mobile and wallet technology. The availability of our financial access platform on these slot ticket redemption devices provides us with additional points of contact with gaming patrons at locations that are typically closer to gaming devices than traditional financial access devices that are generally located on the periphery of the gaming area and provides gaming patrons with more opportunities to access their cash with less cashier involvement.
Other Integrated Kiosk Solutions provide casinos with more efficient and streamlined methods for cash handling and transaction processing. These products are designed to be integrated with our financial access products and cage compliance software ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, and provide an automated way to process common tax forms, such as the Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G or Form 1042-S. In addition, we offer hardware in the form of standalone, non-funds dispensing terminals that perform authorizations for credit card financial access and POS debit card financial access transactions. Our kiosk solutions include the following products:
•JackpotXchange family of kiosks, JXC 4.0, and JXC-L, enable casino personnel to efficiently access funds to pay winning slot machine jackpots to their patrons. These kiosks are integrated with all major slot accounting systems to offer jackpot processing and payout in a combination of cash or slot tickets. These kiosks offer gaming operators the ability to reduce workload for cage operations and slot personnel.
•CageXchange is a cash dispensing device that helps streamline casino cage operations. With CageXchange, cash is securely vaulted, creating increased security while also reducing cash shrinkage and helping to improve cashier accuracy. Additional efficiencies are achieved from accelerating the process of cage cashiers obtaining money from the vault. CageXchange is integrated with CashClub® to create an efficient transaction for casino patrons.
•Our Cash Recycling Solutions allow casinos to fully automate the check in and check out process of money, saving time and expense. As gaming operators vary in size and complexity, these Cash Recycling Solutions support a number of diverse operations such as retail, food and beverage, entertainment, and gaming operations. 
Loyalty Kiosk and Related Equipment provide gaming operators with self-service loyalty enrollment, player card issuance, and marketing equipment that manages and delivers a gaming operator’s marketing programs through the patron interfaces. This loyalty-related equipment allows the customer to utilize and interact with the loyalty platform as the central hub for all the marketing offerings. 
•Enrollment Kiosk is a self-service kiosk that allows casino patrons to either sign up for an initial loyalty card or print a replacement card. These kiosks provide an enhanced level of customer service when the club desk is busy or closed by creating patron self-service locations throughout the casino floor without costly infrastructure or additional overhead costs. Such kiosks also assist with updating contact information of card holders and to verify email or phone contact with a two-step verification process.
•Promotional Kiosk is a kiosk that engages casino patrons with the casino’s loyalty programs, unifying patron service functions into a simple self-service solution. With a range of promotions and offers, the kiosk enables the customer to better manage their marketing efforts. A flexible interface and control panel functionality enable the kiosk to be responsive to customers’ changing business conditions or plans. With the drawings feature, multiple point to entry conversion ratios can be controlled by the hour, as well as scheduled prize earnings. Customized content is shared 
throughout the solution with property amenities that include menus, photos, and video content. With a graphic-rich, statistically-optimized, and exciting promotions catalog library of more than 300 games, critical assets for instant win, episodic board games, and earn and wins, customers’ patrons can easily access differentiated content.
Sales 
As of December 31, 2022, we served more than 3,100 casinos and other gaming properties primarily in the United States and Canada, with additional customers in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe, the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia. 
In our Games and FinTech businesses, we sell and market our products and services primarily through direct sales force, which targets regulated gaming operators in the United States, Canada, and in certain international markets. Our sales and marketing efforts are directed by a team of customer service executives, each of whom has business development responsibility for gaming operators in specified geographic regions. These customer service executives direct their efforts at various gaming operator personnel, including: senior executives, finance professionals, marketing staff, slot directors, and cashiers, and seek to educate them on the benefits of our products and services. In some cases, our customer service executives are supported by field service and customer engagement teams, who provide on-site customer service. In other cases, our sales executives directly maintain the customer relationships. These customer service executives and field service and customer engagement teams generally reside in the vicinity of the specific gaming operators they support to provide a prompt response to the needs of those gaming operators. In some situations, we also have joint sales efforts with several strategic partners, including independent sales organizations, which allow us to market our products and services to gaming operators through channels other than our direct sales force.
Markets 
Development Activities
We conduct research and development activities for both our Gaming and FinTech lines of business.
Our Games research and development activities are primarily to develop gaming systems, game engines, casino data management systems, central determination and other electronic bingo-outcome determination systems, video lottery outcome determination systems, gaming platforms and gaming content, and to enhance our existing product lines. 
Our FinTech research and development activities are primarily to develop: (i) payments products, systems, and related capabilities including security, encryption, and business rule engines that deliver differentiated patron experiences and integrate with our other products; (ii) compliance products that increase efficiencies, profitability, enhance employee/patron relationships, and meet regulatory reporting requirements; and (iii) loyalty products, systems, and features that attract, engage, and retain patrons in more intuitive and contextual ways than our competition.
We believe our ability to deliver differentiated, appealing products and services to the marketplace is based on our research and development investments, and we expect to continue to make such investments in the future. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, consulting fees, certification, and testing fees. Once the technological feasibility has been established, the project is capitalized until it becomes available for general release.
Competitive Conditions 
With respect to our Games business, we compete across different gaming markets with a variety of gaming technology and equipment suppliers. Competition is generally based upon the: (i) amount of revenue our products generate for our customers relative to the amount of revenue generated by our competitors’ products, which correlate directly to the appeal of these products to gaming patrons and (ii) prices and fees we and our competitors charge for products and services offered. To improve product attractiveness and drive customer demand, we work to develop a consistent pipeline of new game themes, game platforms, hardware cabinets, and systems that are expected to appeal to gaming patrons; obtain appropriate gaming regulatory approvals for such products; and offer these new products to the marketplace in a timely manner.
With respect to our FinTech business, we compete with other providers of financial access services to the gaming industry. Some of these other providers have established cooperative relationships with each other to expand their service offerings. We also face competition from: (i) other manufacturers that provide similar goods and services; (ii) independent sales organizations, which provide basic services often at aggressive pricing; and (iii) traditional transaction processors that have entered the gaming patron financial access services market. This competition amongst these various providers can result in pricing pressure and margin erosion with respect to our core financial access products and services. In addition to competing with various providers of financial access services, FinTech experiences competition from either those same providers or standalone providers of AML compliance products and self-service kiosks for ticket and jackpot redemption.
Resources
Manufacturing
We have assembly facilities in Austin, Texas, Las Vegas, Nevada and Sydney, Australia, where we assemble gaming machines and kiosk products, which comprise a variety of components, including cabinet hardware, computer assemblies, LCD screens, printers, bill validators and acceptors, power transformer and wiring harnesses. We believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials for our products are generally adequate. We utilize contract manufacturers to produce the cabinet hardware that make up our gaming machines, kiosk products, and certain other sub-assemblies.
Intellectual Property 
We believe the ability to introduce and respond to technological innovation in the gaming industry will be an increasingly important qualification for the future success of any provider of financial access and gaming-related products and services. Our continued competitiveness will depend on: (i) the pace of our new product development; (ii) our patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection; and (iii) our relationships with customers. Our business development personnel work with gaming operators, our technology and other strategic partners, and the suppliers of the financial services upon which our financial access services rely, to design and develop innovative products and services that appeal to gaming patrons.
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. The expiration dates of these patents vary and are based on their filing and issuances dates. We intend to continue to actively file for patent protection, when such filings are commercially reasonable, within and outside the United States. We also seek trademark protection for our names and products and have registered hundreds of trademarks in the United States and various foreign countries. Under permission or license agreements with third parties, we also sell gaming products covered by independently filed copyrights, trademarks, or patents. Typically, these contracts require us to pay royalties to the licensing party. Royalty expenses are included in the cost of gaming equipment and systems in our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our patents, trademarks, and copyrights, we also rely on a broader scope of intellectual property including trade secrets, in-house know-how, and innovation.
Human Capital 
Composition of our workforce
As of December 31, 2022, Everi employed approximately 2,000 people, a vast majority of whom work in the United States. Approximately 800 people are employed within the Games segment and approximately 1,200 people are employed within the FinTech segment. None of our employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement and we have had no labor-related work stoppages.
Culture of our workplace
In 2022, we reaffirmed our mission statement and continued to focus on our employees’ collective imagination, talent, and innovation with our Company’s objectives. At Everi, we are guided by our values of collaboration, integrity, inclusion, excellence, and fun. We (i) Harness the power of collaboration; (ii) Act with integrity; (iii) Value Everi-One; (iv) Exceed expectations and be bold. When we deliver on these values consistently, we H.A.V.E. (v) Fun! We live these values by investing in programs and implementing standards to promote ethical business conduct, diversity, sustainability, giving and volunteerism, and responsible gaming. These programs support our long-term business success while also empowering our team members.
Inspired by Author Simon Sinek’s concept of the Golden Circle and the importance of identifying the “WHY” behind your business, Everi has established a company “WHY” statement. As part of our continued growth and our desire to define and share our Company “WHY” statement more broadly, we apply the Company “WHY” that put our employees and their success front and center:
Elevate the Success of:
•Everi Employee
•Everi Customer
•Everi Day!
Diversity and Inclusion 
At Everi, we embrace and live by one of our key Company values: Inclusion. We recognize that we can be at our best only when we embrace and reflect the diversity of our employees, customers, and the communities that we serve. We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment. Our employees are to be treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from harassment and discrimination regardless of race, color, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or any other protected class.
The Company activates its commitment to diversity and inclusion by employing a multi-pronged strategy: (i) promoting a fun, friendly, and supportive environment; (ii) valuing inclusion as a top priority and expectation; (iii) focusing resources on recruiting and retaining qualified employees from diverse backgrounds; and (iv) continuously building awareness of the importance and benefits that diversity and inclusion provide to our Company and employees. In addition, our Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee oversee initiatives and metrics in relation to human capital management, including corporate culture, diversity, acceptance, inclusion, and attracting and retaining talent.
We require mandatory Company-wide diversity and inclusion training to cultivate an inclusive, engaging, and respectful workplace. This training addresses some of the biggest challenges to advancing inclusion and supporting diversity in the workplace, such as unconscious bias and micro-inequities. In addition, because hiring managers are faced with the critical responsibility of acknowledging and eliminating bias in the hiring process, we have developed manager training that establishes a foundational understanding of how bias affects decision-making, explores the impact of biases on the selection processes, and illustrates the benefits of eliminating bias in hiring. The example we expect our employees to follow comes from the top, as demonstrated by our executive leadership team who also participated in training on inclusive leadership. 
Everi is also working to increase the representation of women in our workforce. In 2017, the Company launched The Women’s Leadership Initiative (WLI), which seeks to develop and advance gender diversity and create new opportunities and a clearer path for advancement. The WLI is committed to promoting and advocating gender diversity at all levels of leadership through awareness, training, development, and inspiration. Participants in the WLI engage and connect with other WLI members, Company employees and leaders, and diverse stakeholders in the gaming industry. WLI members also participate in educational programs such as “lunch and learn” events with internal business leaders and training opportunities with experts outside the industry. The WLI leads the Company’s mentorship program for U.S. employees, providing the benefit of advice and insights from Everi mentors to all mentees.
At Everi, we also take the time to acknowledge and celebrate the diverse heritage of our employees, customers, and communities. Throughout the year, the Company focuses on different heritage celebrations, holidays, and commemorations, and we connect with our employees to build awareness through educational webinars and guest lectures. We also engage with our communities by donating to charitable organizations that provide local support and services.
Employee Engagement
Aligning with our values of Inclusion and Collaboration, we seek continuous dialogue with our employees about their experience at Everi. With more than 70% of our employee population working remotely, maintaining strong employee engagement, and offering methods for employee input are more important than ever. We utilize several effective employee feedback mechanisms, including annual employee surveys, Company-wide email communications and periodic town hall meetings. These tools and platforms provide important Company updates from leadership but also moments for employee participation and involvement. Everi’s leadership team directly addresses employee feedback provided through these mechanisms. In doing so, we strive to instill confidence that employee input leads to positive action. We have seen an increase in positive scores.
Everi participates in the “Top Workplaces” and “Great Place to Work” programs, benchmarking our employee experience against thousands of other organizations across the U.S. In 2022, the Company received seven separate awards, reflecting the belief of our employees in the Company’s direction, operations and future: we repeated as a Nevada Top Workplace; we repeated as Greater Austin Top Workplace in 2022; we were awarded four 2022 Culture Excellence Awards at a National level in Leadership, Innovation, Compensation & Benefits, and Work-life Flexibility; and we also repeated as Great Place to Work (India) at our overseas Technology Development Centers.
Employee Development and Training
We provide development and training opportunities for our employees through a variety of means. The Company offers leadership training and development for all newly hired and promoted leaders, as well as a catalog of courses through our online learning platform. This catalog of courses is available to all employees and includes a wide variety of leadership and professional development topics, such as conflict management, effective delegation, unconscious bias, effective recognition, coaching and delivering feedback. We believe in supporting each employee’s journey, so we also offer training courses on soft skills such as emotional intelligence, email etiquette, and developing presence. 
Talent Acquisition and Diverse Recruiting
The Recruitment Team utilizes tools and systems to search for talent from a broader range of sources, knowing that many of the positions would be filled by individuals working remotely. These tools reduce geographic barriers in the talent acquisition process, yielding a larger talent pool to fill all roles, including those that require specific skills in the current competitive job market. We also continue to enhance our Recruitment Team so that we can effectively identify new talent for our growing business.
At Everi, we know that creativity and innovation spring from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. With the goal of expanding diverse talent in the workplace, we continue to utilize a blind resume screening process for initial applicants to review talent, experience, and qualifications without certain demographic information. We also look for ways to expand the talent pool and reach new candidates: A member of our Recruitment Team is dedicated to working with different educational institutions, professional associations, student organizations and other entities to provide information and assistance to their diverse students and job seekers, and to identify new candidates for our open positions.
Employee Health and Wellness
Everi considers the health and safety of our employees to be of paramount importance. We have policies in place to monitor the working conditions of our employees and implement measures to protect their health, safety, and well-being. 
Our benefits are designed to recognize the diverse needs of our workforce. Our program provides competitive and comprehensive benefit options at a reasonable cost to our employees. Our benefits include an array of offerings, such as comprehensive medical, dental and wellness benefits, flexible time off plans and paid holidays, flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match on employee contributions, and financial wellness services. On an annual basis, we issue an employee benefits survey to gather feedback from our employees on our benefit offerings and use their input to make improvements.
Everi focuses on compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace health and safety as well as emergency and disaster recovery for its operations. We continue to rely upon guidance from national health organizations related to the macro environment with the goal of protecting our employees from potential harm.
Seasonality
Our revenues and cash flows may fluctuate throughout the year driven by seasonality, among other factors. Historically, we have generally experienced higher operating income during the first half of a year and lower operating results during the second half of a year; however, such fluctuations do not have a material impact on our revenues and cash flow. 
Government Regulation
General
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the material gaming and financial institution laws applicable to our business. We have a diligent internal compliance program governing our business activities, as well as legal requirements generally applicable to publicly traded companies. The compliance program is directed on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Legal Officer, who also serves as Chief Compliance Officer. Legal advice is provided by attorneys from the Company’s legal department and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Corporate Compliance Committee, which includes an independent member. While complying with these regulations can require significant time and resources, we do not believe it results in costs that materially impact our earnings, capital expenditures, or competitive position. Despite our compliance efforts, we can give no assurance, however, that our business activities or the activities of our customers in the gaming industry will not be subject to any regulatory or legal enforcement proceedings in the future.
Gaming Regulation 
The gaming industry is highly regulated under legal systems that frequently evolve and change based on governmental public policies. Various aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive laws, regulations, and ordinances applicable to the ownership, management, and operation of gambling operators, manufacture and distribution of gaming devices, as well as certain financial services conducted at such operators. The stated policies and other purposes behind such laws, regulations, and ordinances are generally to: (i) secure the public’s trust and confidence in legalized gambling through a system of mandated regulation, internal controls, accounting practices, and operating procedures; and (ii) promote economic activity for the state, county, and local governments through revenue opportunities emanating from taxes, licensing fees, and other economic benefits arising out of gambling and related activities.
A description of the material regulations to which we are subject is set forth below.
Gaming Authorities. We are regulated by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal, and foreign government agencies (collectively, “Gaming Authorities”) in the jurisdictions where we conduct business as either a: (i) manufacturer of gaming devices, in those jurisdictions where we manufacture gaming devices and systems; (ii) distributor of gaming devices, in those jurisdictions where we distribute gaming devices and systems; (iii) supplier of “associated equipment,” in those jurisdictions where we sell and service fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions; and (iv) non-gaming supplier or vendor, in those jurisdictions where we provide financial access and Central Credit services only. We must maintain those licenses, registrations, or other approvals in good standing to continue our business. Gaming Authorities have broad discretion in determining whether to grant a license, registration, or other approval. Subject to complying with certain procedural requirements, Gaming Authorities may deny any application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability, qualification, or other approval for any cause deemed reasonable to them. 
Approvals, Licensing, and Suitability
The process of obtaining necessary licenses, registrations, or other approvals often involves substantial disclosure of confidential or proprietary information about us and our officers, directors, key personnel and, in certain instances, beneficial owners of our debt or equity securities, and requires a determination by the regulators as to our suitability as a manufacturer, distributor, supplier, or vendor to gaming operators. Authorities have broad discretion and may require any beneficial holder of our securities, regardless of the number of shares of common stock or amount of debt securities owned, to file an application, make personal or confidential disclosures, be investigated, and be subject to a determination of suitability. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage (most commonly 5%) of voting securities of a publicly-traded gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, to report the acquisition to Gaming Authorities, and Gaming Authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for investment purposes only.
Product Approvals
Our gaming devices and certain other products and technologies must be certified or approved by Gaming Authorities in many jurisdictions where we conduct business. These Gaming Authorities test the gaming devices, systems, and related equipment directly or through an independent testing laboratory and may also require a field trial under the regulator’s technical standards before allowing us to sell the product. Although we collaborate closely with the Gaming Authorities and independent testing laboratories, we cannot control whether our products will be approved or the length of time it will take to review our products for sale to third parties. Moreover, there are no guarantees that we will be successful in obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals; or in continuing to hold other necessary gaming licenses, permits, and approvals to conduct our businesses either as currently being conducted by us or to expand our businesses.
Our Native American customers are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”), which was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”). The NIGC has regulatory authority over certain aspects of Native American gaming and defines the boundaries of our dealings with the Native American marketplace and the level of regulatory authority to which these games are subject. IGRA establishes three classes of gaming, each with a different regulatory framework:

Class | Type of Games | Regulatory Oversight 
I | Social gaming for minimal prizes and traditional Native American gaming. | Exclusive regulation and oversight by tribal governments. 
II | Bingo (both in traditional and electronic form). | Regulation by tribal governments with NIGC oversight. 
III | Casino style games (including slot machines, blackjack, craps, and roulette). | Must be permitted by the state in which the tribe is located. The state and the tribe must have negotiated a compact approved by NIGC, and the tribe must have adopted a gaming ordinance approved by the NIGC.

We provide our gaming devices and systems in both Class II and Class III markets.
Class III gaming on Native American tribal lands is usually subject to the negotiation of a compact between the tribe and the proximate state attendant to where the tribe intends to operate a gaming facility. These tribal-state compacts typically include provisions entitling the state to receive significant sums of money in exchange for the tribe’s operation of Class III gaming. While tribal-state compacts are intended to document the agreement between the state and a tribe, these tribal-state compacts can be subject to disputes relative to permitted Class III gaming operations.
The Johnson Act. The Johnson Act, as amended by the federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962 (the “Johnson Act”), requires that we register annually with the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, and requires a wide variety of record keeping and equipment identification efforts on our part. Registration is required for us to sell, distribute, manufacture, transport, or receive gaming equipment, machines, or components across state lines. If we fail to comply with the requirements set forth under the Johnson Act, we could become subject to a variety of penalties, including, but not limited to, the seizure and forfeiture of equipment.
Internet and Online Gaming Regulation. Several states have passed legislation and regulations to allow certain intra-state, wager-based, online casino, or lottery games, such as online poker, online lottery, lottery ticket purchases, or lottery ticket subscriptions. To date, several states have authorized some form of Internet or online gaming or lottery activities. However, the legislative and regulatory framework governing these activities may continue to evolve in the future.
Financial Services Regulation 
Our FinTech business is also subject to several financial services regulations:
Durbin Amendment. Rules promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, required as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), including the so-called Durbin Amendment (the “Durbin Amendment”), establish, among other things, standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by certain debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Debit card interchange fees are established by payment card networks and ultimately paid by merchants to debit card issuers for each debit transaction.
Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, other federal statutes, generally referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act, and implementing federal regulations require us to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program. Our anti-money laundering program includes the following: internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to identify and report money laundering, a designated compliance officer, ongoing employee training programs, an independent audit function to test the program, and customer due diligence. In addition, the financial access services we provide are subject to record keeping and reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Our gaming operator customers are required to file a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to report any suspicious transactions relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. We are also required to file a SAR in certain circumstances where we provide our financial access services directly to patrons. To be reportable, such a transaction must meet criteria that are designed to identify the hiding or disguising of funds derived from illegal activities. Our gaming operator customers, in situations where our financial access services are provided through gaming operator cashier personnel, and we, in situations where we provide our financial access services, are required to file a Currency Transaction Report (“CTR”) of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer by, through, or to us which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 in a single day. Our CashClub® product can assist in identifying transactions that give rise to reporting obligations. 
We also have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. We maintain policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.
Fund Transfers. Our POS debit card financial access transactions, credit card financial access transactions, and funds dispensing services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides cardholders with rights with respect to electronic fund transfers, including the right to dispute unauthorized charges, charges that list the wrong date or amount, charges for goods and services that are not accepted or delivered as agreed, math errors, and charges for which a cardholder asks for an explanation or written proof of transaction along with a claimed error or request for clarification. We believe the necessary policies and procedures have been implemented throughout our organization to comply with the regulatory requirements for fund transfers.
State Money Transmission Laws. Many states where we complete credit card financial access and POS debit card financial access transactions or offer our online payment processing solution require us to have a money transmitter license, typically issued by the state’s Financial Institutions Division. These state laws subject us to, among other requirements, examinations by state regulatory agencies, reporting requirements, net worth and bonding requirements, and consumer disclosure requirements.
Check Cashing. In jurisdictions in which we may provide check cashing services, we are required to be licensed by the applicable state banking regulator at the appropriate level for the services we deliver. Some states also impose restrictions on this activity, such as limits on the amounts of service fees that may be imposed on the cashing of certain types of checks, requirements as to records that must be kept with respect to dishonored checks, and requirements as to the contents of receipts that must be delivered to gaming patrons at the time a check is cashed.
Credit Reporting. Our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services and check verification and warranty services are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACTA”) and their implementing rules, which require consumer credit bureaus, such as Central Credit, to provide credit report information to businesses only for certain purposes and to otherwise safeguard credit report information, to disclose to consumers their credit report on request, and to permit consumers to dispute and correct inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit report. These laws and rules also govern the information that may be contained in a consumer credit report. We continue to implement policies and procedures as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition to federal regulations, our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services are subject to the state credit reporting regulations that impose similar requirements to the FCRA and the FACTA.
Debt Collection. We currently outsource most of our debt collection efforts to third parties. However, we may engage in debt collection to collect on chargebacks on our financial access products and unpaid balances for services performed for our check services, Central Credit services, compliance services, receivables relating to the sale and service of our fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions, and other amounts owing to us in connection with performing various services for our customers. All such collection practices may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”), which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive debt collection practices, as well as consumer-debt-collection laws and regulations adopted by the various states.
Consumer Financial Services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, state, and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies have the authority to regulate consumer financial products. These agencies have broad statutory powers, including to promulgate rules, issue interpretations, and take enforcement actions that may affect our business.
Privacy Regulations. Our collection of information from patrons who use our financial products and services, such as our financial access services, are subject to the financial information privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) and its implementing federal regulations. We gather, as permitted by law, non-public, personally-identifiable financial information from patrons who use our financial access services, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank and credit card account numbers, and transaction information. The GLBA requires us to safeguard and protect the privacy of such non-public personal information and requires us to make disclosures to patrons regarding our privacy and information sharing policies and give patrons the opportunity to direct us not to disclose information about them to unaffiliated third parties in certain situations. We are also subject to state privacy regulations which, in some cases, may be even stricter than federal law, including without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act which became effective as of January 1, 2020. We continue to implement policies and programs as well as adapt our business practices to comply with federal and state privacy laws and regulations. In addition, we are subject to foreign data protection and privacy laws including, but not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018 and requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding data privacy and security. 
Funds Dispensed Operations. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act requires us to disclose certain notices regarding the fees that we charge for performing a funds dispensed transaction as well as to incorporate such notices on the ATM screens to notify patrons of such fees prior to completing a funds dispensed transaction. Our funds dispensed services are also subject to applicable state banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs which require, among other things, that we register with the state banking regulators as an operator of ATMs, that we provide gaming patrons with notices of the transaction fees assessed upon use of our ATMs, that our transaction fees do not exceed designated maximums, that we offer gaming patrons a means of resolving disputes with us, and that we comply with prescribed safety and security requirements. In addition, the ATMs we operate are subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which in general require that ATMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired persons.
Network and Card Association Regulations. In addition to the governmental regulations described above, some of our services are also subject to rules promulgated by various payment networks, EFT networks, and card associations. For example, we must comply with the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard. We have been designated as a compliant service provider under the PCI Data Security Standard. We must be certified to maintain our status as a compliant service provider on an annual basis.
The Europay, MasterCard, and Visa global standard for cards equipped with security chip technology (“EMV”) is designed to deter fraudulent card transactions related to identity theft, counterfeit cards, and the misuse of lost or stolen cards via enhanced card authentication, transaction authorization, and cardholder verification using chip-based smart-cards. EMV has 
been adopted in many regions of the world as the global standard for fraud deterrence in chip-based smart-card payments. Merchants whose devices are not capable of processing chip-based smart-card EMV transactions are responsible for chargebacks due to fraudulent transactions on such cards.
As a merchant of financial access transactions processed through MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express, all who have adopted the EMV standard, and as an operator of ATMs, our POS, fully-integrated kiosk, and ATM devices are subject to the EMV standard. This requires us to maintain our fleet of U.S.-based POS, fully-integrated kiosk, and ATM devices to support the EMV standard.
International Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of gaming and financial services regulations and other laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in the international markets in which we operate. We expect to become subject to additional gaming and financial services regulations and other laws in the jurisdictions into which we expand our operations. Our expansion into new markets is dependent upon our ability to comply with the regulatory regimes adopted by such jurisdictions.
