Item 1.    Business
GENERAL
We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, which imposes certain investment restrictions on our portfolio. Our investment objective is to provide our stockholders with both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. Our investment strategy is to maintain a credit investment portfolio focused primarily on middle-market companies in the United States. We use the term “middle-market” to refer to companies that may exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: number of employees between 150 and 2,000; revenues between $15 million and $300 million; annual EBITDA between $5 million and $50 million; generally, private companies owned by private equity firms or owners/operators; and enterprise value between $10 million and $500 million. For additional information about how we define the middle-market, see “—Investment Criteria/Guidelines.”
Our investment strategy focuses primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the United States, including investments in senior secured loans, which are comprised of first-lien, second-lien and unitranche loans, as well as investments in subordinated loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other equity securities. Our investments may be directly originated or may be purchased on a secondary basis in the U.S. leveraged loan market for Broadly Syndicated Loans (as defined below). As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” as specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our assets, as defined by the 1940 Act, are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in “eligible portfolio companies.” Under the relevant SEC rules, the term “eligible portfolio company” includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States. Conversely, we may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in opportunistic investments not otherwise eligible under BDC regulations. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may consider investments in investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the 1940 Act and in advisers to similar investment funds, as well as in debt or equity of middle-market portfolio companies located outside of the United States, and debt and equity of public companies that do not meet the definition of eligible portfolio companies because their market capitalization of publicly traded equity securities exceeds the levels provided for in the 1940 Act. We have made, and may continue to make, opportunistic investments in Structured Finance Securities and other non-qualifying assets (discussed below), consistent with our investment strategy. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 80% and 85%, respectively, of our investments were qualifying assets. 
As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our debt investment portfolio totaled $312.9 million in 52 portfolio companies, of which 99.6% and 0.4% were comprised of senior secured loans and subordinated loans, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our equity investments totaled $99.2 million in 16 portfolio companies, and the fair value of our 23 Structured Finance Security investments totaled $88.5 million.
We have executed our investment strategy, in part, through SBIC I LP, a licensee under the SBA’s SBIC program, which is subject to SBA regulations and policies, including periodic audits by the SBA. On a stand-alone basis, SBIC I LP held approximately $176.5 million and $195.5 million in assets, or approximately 34% and 34% of our total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As part of our plans to focus on providing first lien senior secured loans to larger borrowers, which we believe will improve our overall risk profile, SBIC I LP is repaying over time its outstanding SBA debentures prior to their scheduled maturity dates. As such, we are not making new investments through SBIC I LP, other than follow-on investments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made a $2.4 million follow-on investment in a portfolio company and redeemed $19.0 million of SBA debentures. For additional information regarding the regulation of SBIC I LP, see “Regulation—Small Business Investment Company Regulations.”
    We also execute on our investment strategy, in part, through OFSCC-FS, which established the BNP Facility on June 20, 2019, to provide borrowings of up to $150.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we amended the BNP Facility to, among other things: (i) extend the reinvestment period for three years from June 20, 2022 to June 20, 2025; and (ii) extend the maturity date from June 20, 2024 to June 20, 2027. On a stand-alone basis, OFSCC-FS held approximately $173.7 million and $185.1 million in assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which accounted for approximately 33% and 33% of our consolidated total assets, respectively.
We further execute our investment strategy, in part, by investing in Structured Finance Securities. We believe OFS Advisor is uniquely positioned, given its expertise in structured credit and managing CLOs, to make opportunistic investments 
in Structured Finance Securities, through which we target attractive risk-adjusted returns. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased $43.2 million and $30.4 million of Structured Finance Securities, respectively.
A BDC is generally not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing, it has an asset coverage ratio for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). However, Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act permits BDCs to be subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, if specific conditions are satisfied, when issuing senior securities (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 66 2/3% of the value of our assets).
On May 3, 2018, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the application of Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and, as a result, effective May 3, 2019, the asset coverage ratio test applicable to us was decreased from 200% to 150%. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Structure — Because we received the approval of our Board, we became subject to 150% Asset Coverage effective May 3, 2019.” Additionally, effective November 26, 2013, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to exclude our SBA guaranteed debentures from the definition of senior securities in the statutory asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act. 
 Consistent with our strategy to maintain a leveraged portfolio of credit investments, our debt levels of $335.6 million and $349.9 million resulted in a statutory asset coverage ratio of 163% and 173% as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
We have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To continue to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. Pursuant to this election, we generally are not required to pay corporate-level taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. 
Our investment activities are managed by OFS Advisor and supervised by our Board, a majority of whom are independent of us, OFS Advisor and its affiliates. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay OFS Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser or sub-adviser to various clients, including HPCI, OCCI, CMFT Securities Investments, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CIM Real Estate Finance Trust, Inc., a corporation that qualifies as a real estate investment trust, and CIM Real Assets & Credit Fund, an externally managed registered investment company under the 1940 Act that operates as an interval fund that invests primarily in a combination of real estate, credit and related investments. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to OFS Advisor and its Affiliates — We have potential conflicts of interest related to obligations that OFS Advisor or its affiliates may have to other clients.”
Also, we have entered into an Administration Agreement with OFS Services. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse OFS Services for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of overhead and other expenses incurred by OFS Services in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. See “—Management and Other Agreements–Administration Agreement.”
About OFS and Our Advisor 
    OFS is a full-service provider of capital and leveraged finance solutions to U.S. companies. As of December 31, 2022, OFS had 50 full-time employees. OFS is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and also has offices in New York, New York and Los Angeles, California. Under the Staffing Agreement, OFSC makes experienced investment professionals available to OFS Advisor and provides OFS Advisor with access to the senior investment personnel of OFS and its affiliates. The Staffing Agreement also provides OFS Advisor with access to deal flow generated by OFS and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their businesses and commits the members of OFS Advisor’s investment committees to serve in that capacity.
    Our investment activities are managed by OFS Advisor, our investment adviser. OFS Advisor is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on potential investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments, and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. As our investment adviser, OFS Advisor allocates investment opportunities among us and any other clients fairly and equitably over time in accordance with its allocation policy. See "Regulation — Exemptive Relief." OFS Advisor is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act and a wholly owned subsidiary of OFSAM.
    Our relationship with OFS Advisor is governed by and dependent on the Investment Advisory Agreement and may be subject to conflicts of interest. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to OFS Advisor and its Affiliates." OFS Advisor provides us with advisory services in exchange for a base management fee and incentive fee; see “Management and Other Agreements—Investment Advisory Agreement”. Our management fee includes assets purchased with borrowed funds and assets owned by any consolidated entity; therefore, OFS Advisor will benefit when we incur debt or use leverage. Our Board is charged with protecting stockholders' interests by monitoring how OFS Advisor addresses these and other conflicts of interest associated with its management services and compensation. While our Board is not expected to review or approve each 
borrowing or incurrence of leverage, our independent directors periodically review OFS Advisor’s services and fees as well as its portfolio management decisions and portfolio performance. 
OFS Advisor capitalizes on the deal origination and sourcing, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of OFS’s professionals. The senior management team of OFS, including Bilal Rashid and Jeffrey A. Cerny, provides services to OFS Advisor. These managers have developed a broad network of contacts within the investment community, and possess an average of over 25 years of experience investing in debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. In addition, these managers have extensive experience investing in assets that constitute our primary focus and have expertise in investing across all levels of the capital structure of middle-market companies. 
Competitive Strengths and Core Competencies 
    Deep Management Team Experienced in All Phases of Investment Cycle and Across All Levels of the Capital Structure. We are managed by OFS Advisor, which has access to the resources and expertise of OFS’s investment professionals through the Staffing Agreement with OFSC. As of December 31, 2022, OFS’s credit and investment professionals (including all investment committee members) employed by OFSC had an average of over 15 years of investment experience with strong institutional backgrounds.
    Investment Capacity. The net proceeds of equity and debt offerings and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities should provide us with a sufficient amount of capital available for deployment into new investment opportunities in our targeted asset class. 
    Scalable Infrastructure Supporting the Entire Investment Cycle. We believe that our loan acquisition, origination and sourcing, underwriting, administration and management platform is scalable (that is, it can be expanded on a cost-efficient basis within a timeframe that meets the demands of business growth). Our platform extends beyond origination and sourcing and includes a regimented credit monitoring system. We believe that our careful approach, which involves ongoing review and analysis by an experienced team of professionals, should enable us to identify problems early and to assist borrowers before they face difficult liquidity constraints. 
    Extensive Loan Sourcing Capabilities. OFS Advisor gives us access to the deal flow of OFS. We believe OFS’s 25-year history as a middle-market lending platform, extensive relationships with potential borrowers and other lenders, and its market position make it a leading lender to many sponsors and other deal sources, especially in the currently under-served lending environment. 
    Structuring with a High Level of Service and Operational Orientation. We provide client-specific and creative financing structures to our portfolio companies. Based on our experience in lending to, and investing in, middle-market companies, we believe that the middle-market companies we target, as well as sponsor groups we may pursue, require a higher level of service, creativity and knowledge than has historically been provided by other service providers more accustomed to participating in commodity-like loan transactions. 
Rigorous Credit Analysis and Approval Procedures. OFS Advisor utilizes an established, disciplined investment process of OFS for reviewing lending opportunities, structuring transactions and monitoring investments. Using a disciplined approach to lending, OFS Advisor seeks to minimize credit losses through effective underwriting, comprehensive due diligence investigations, structuring and, where appropriate, the implementation of restrictive debt covenants.
Our Administrator 
    We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by OFS Advisor. We have a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, chief accounting officer, corporate secretary and, to the extent necessary, our Board may elect to appoint additional officers going forward. Our officers are employees of OFSC, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, and a portion of the compensation paid to our officers is paid by us pursuant to the Administration Agreement. All of our executive officers are also officers of OFS Advisor. 
    OFS Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. OFS Services furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, necessary software licenses and subscriptions and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. OFS Services oversees our financial reporting as well as prepares our reports to stockholders and all other reports and materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. OFS Services also manages the determination and publication of our NAV, the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. OFS Services may retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that OFS Services outsources any of its functions, we will directly pay the fees associated with such services. 
Market Opportunity 
    Our investment strategy is focused primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the United States. We find the middle-market attractive for the following reasons: 
    Large Target Market. According to the National Center for the Middle Market, as of the fourth quarter of 2022, there were approximately 200,000 companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $1.0 billion. We believe that these middle-market companies represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have historically constituted the bulk of OFS’s portfolio companies since its inception and constituted the majority of our portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2022. We believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.
    Specialized Lending Requirements with High Barriers to Entry. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to private middle-market companies in the United States (a) is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (b) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (c) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. As a result, middle-market companies historically have been served by a limited segment of the lending community. Due to the unique challenges facing lenders to middle-market companies, we believe that there are high barriers to entry that a new lender must overcome.
    Robust Demand for Debt Capital. We believe that private equity firms have significant committed but uncalled capital, a large portion of which is available for investment in the United States. Subject to market conditions, we expect the large amount of unfunded buyout commitments will drive demand for leveraged buyouts over the next several years, which should, in turn, create leveraged lending opportunities for us.
Competition 
    Our primary competitors include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. Many of these competitors have similar investment objectives to us, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our investment opportunity. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and investment strategies, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Further, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC, or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our RIC status. 
    We expect to continue to use the expertise of the investment professionals of OFS to whom we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of the senior members of OFS and its affiliates will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses" for additional information concerning the competitive risks we face. 
Investment Criteria/Guidelines 
    Our investment objective is to provide our stockholders with both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. We focus on investments in senior secured loans, including first lien, second lien, and unitranche loans, as well as subordinated loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other equity securities and Structured Finance Securities. In particular, we believe that structured equity with debt investments (i.e., typically senior secured unitranche loans, often with warrant coverage, and, at times, in companies with no financial sponsor) represent a strong relative value opportunity offering the borrower the convenience of dealing with one lender, which may result in a higher blended rate of interest to us than we might expect to receive under a traditional multi-tranche structure. We expect that our investments in the equity securities of portfolio companies, such as warrants, preferred stock, common stock and other equity interests, will principally be made in conjunction with our debt investments. Generally, we do not expect to make investments in companies or securities that OFS Advisor determines to be distressed investments (such as discounted debt instruments that have either experienced a default or have a significant potential for default), other than follow-on investments in portfolio companies of ours. We intend to continue to generate strong risk-adjusted net returns by assembling a diversified portfolio of investments across a broad range of industries.
    We target U.S. middle-market companies through OFS’s access to a network of financial institutions, private equity sponsors, investment banks, consultants and attorneys, and our proprietary database of borrowers developed over OFS’s more than 20 years in lending to middle-market companies. A typical targeted borrower will exhibit certain of the following characteristics: 
•number of employees between 150 and 2,000; 
•revenues between $15 million and $300 million; 
•annual EBITDA between $5 million and $50 million; 
•private companies owned by private equity firms or owners/operators; 
•enterprise value between $10 million and $500 million; 
•effective and experienced management teams; 
•defensible market share; 
•solid historical financial performance, including a steady stream of cash flow; 
•high degree of recurring revenue; 
•diversity of customers, markets, products and geography; and 
•differentiated products or services. 
    While we believe that the characteristics listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company.
Due Diligence and Investment Process Overview 
    We employ a thorough and disciplined underwriting and due diligence process that is conducted in accordance with established credit policies and procedures and focused on investment recovery. Our process involves a comprehensive analysis of a prospective portfolio company’s market, operational, financial, and legal position, as well as its future prospects. In addition to our own analysis, we may use the services of third parties for environmental reviews, quality of earnings reports, industry surveys, background checks on key managers, and insurance reviews. 
    We seek to invest in companies that have experienced and incentivized management teams, stable and predictable cash flows, and defensible market positions. We underwrite the majority of our investments with the expectation that we will hold them for a number of years, and we structure and document, as applicable, our investments accordingly. 
    Our due diligence and underwriting process typically addresses the following elements (although certain elements may not be included in every due diligence undertaking): 
Prospective Portfolio Company Characteristics - focusing on primary drivers of the company’s revenues and cash flows, including its key products and services; customer and supplier concentrations, and contractual relationships; depth, breadth, and quality of company management, as well as the extent to which the management team is appropriately compensated with equity incentives; and any regulatory, labor or litigation matters impacting the company. 
Industry and Competitive Overview -  including industry size and the company’s position within it; growth potential and barriers to entry; governmental, regulatory, or technological issues potentially affecting the industry; and cyclicality or seasonality risks associated with the industry. 
Financial Analysis - involving an understanding of the company’s historical financial results, focusing on actual operating trends experienced over time, in order to forecast future performance, including in various sensitized performance scenarios; attention to projected cash flows, debt service coverage, and leverage multiples under such scenarios; and an assessment of enterprise valuations and debt repayment/investment recovery prospects given such sensitized performance scenarios. 
Investment Documentation - focusing on obtaining the best legal protections available to us given our position within the capital structure, including, as appropriate, financial covenants; collateral liens and stock pledges; review of loan documents of other of the prospective portfolio company’s creditors; and negotiation of inter-creditor agreements. 
Portfolio Review/Risk Monitoring 
    We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process, and we benefit from a portfolio management system developed by OFS that includes daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly components, and that involves comprehensive review of the performance of each of our portfolio companies. As part of the portfolio management process, 
OFS Advisor performs ongoing risk assessments on each of our investments and assigns each debt investment a credit rating based on OFS’s internal ratings scale. Our debt investments generally are assigned a rating of 3 at origination or purchase.
    We categorize debt investments into the following risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt: 
    1 (Low Risk) – The debt investment has mostly satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, as well as good leverage capacity. It maintains predictable and strong cash flows from operations. The trends and outlook for the portfolio company's operations, balance sheet, and industry are neutral to favorable. Collateral, if appropriate, has maintained value and would be capable of being liquidated on a timely basis. Overall a debt investment with a 1 risk rating is considered to be of investment grade quality. 
    2 (Below Average Risk) – The debt investment has acceptable asset quality, moderate excess liquidity, and modest leverage capacity. It could have some financial/non-financial weaknesses which are offset by strengths; however, the credit demonstrates an ample current cash flow from operations. The trends and outlook for the portfolio company's operations, balance sheet, and industry are generally positive or neutral to somewhat negative. Collateral, if appropriate, has maintained value and would be capable of being liquidated successfully on a timely basis. 
    3 (Average) – The debt investment has acceptable asset quality, somewhat strained liquidity, and minimal leverage capacity. It is at times characterized by acceptable cash flows from operations. Under adverse market conditions, the debt service could pose difficulties for the borrower. The trends and conditions of the portfolio company's operations and balance sheet are neutral to slightly negative. 
    4 (Special Mention) – The debt investment has not lost, and is not expected to lose, principal or interest but it possesses credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses which deserve management’s close and continued attention. The portfolio company’s operations and/or balance sheet have demonstrated an adverse trend or deterioration which, while serious, has not reached the point where the liquidation of debt is jeopardized. These weaknesses are generally considered correctable by the borrower in the normal course of business but may weaken the asset or inadequately protect our credit position if not checked or corrected. 
    5 (Substandard) – The debt investment is protected inadequately by the current enterprise value or paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any. The portfolio company has well-defined weaknesses based upon objective evidence, such as recurring or significant decreases in revenues and cash flows. These assets are characterized by the possibility that we may sustain loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. The possibility that liquidation would not be timely (e.g., bankruptcy or foreclosure) requires a Substandard classification even if there is little likelihood of loss. 
    6 (Doubtful) – The debt investment has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the additional factor that the weaknesses are pronounced to the point that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, is deemed uncertain. The possibility of loss on a Doubtful asset is high but, because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may strengthen the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status can be determined. 
    7 (Loss) – The debt investment is considered almost fully uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as an asset is not warranted. It is generally a credit that is no longer supported by an operating company, a credit where the majority of our assets have been liquidated or sold and a few assets remain to be sold over many months or even years, or a credit where the remaining collections are expected to be minimal. 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Monitoring” for the classification of our debt investments by risk category.
Investment Committees 
    OFS Advisor’s Pre-Allocation Investment Committee, Broadly Syndicated Investment Committee, Structured Credit Investment Committee and Middle-Market Investment Committee (collectively, the “Advisor Investment Committees”) are responsible for the overall asset allocation decisions and the evaluation and approval of investments of OFS Advisor’s advisory clients. 
    The Middle-Market Investment Committee, comprised of Richard Ressler (Chairman), Jeffrey A. Cerny, Kyde Sharp and Bilal Rashid, along with the investment committee for SBIC I LP (the “SBIC Investment Committee”), comprised of Messrs. Rashid, Cerny, and Tod Reichert, are responsible for the evaluation and approval of all debt and equity investments made by us directly or through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as appropriate. 
    The process employed by the Advisor Investment Committees, including the Middle-Market Investment Committee and the SBIC Investment Committee, is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committees’ members to the investment process. The Middle-Market Investment Committee and SBIC Investment Committee serve to provide 
investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The Middle-Market Investment Committee and SBIC Investment Committee also determine appropriate investment sizing and implement ongoing monitoring requirements of our investments. 
    In certain instances, management may seek the approval of our Board prior to making an investment. In addition to reviewing investments, the meetings of the Middle-Market Investment Committee and SBIC Investment Committee, where applicable, serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flows are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with members of the Middle-Market Investment Committee and SBIC Investment Committee, where applicable, early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members in working efficiently. 
The Structured Credit Investment Committee, comprised of Messrs. Ressler (Chairman), Rashid and Cerny, and Glen Ostrander and Kenneth A. Brown, is responsible for the evaluation and approval of all the Structured Finance Security investments made by us.
Investments
    We pursue an investment strategy focused primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the United States. We focus on investments in loans, in which OFS Advisor’s investment professionals have expertise, including investments in first-lien, unitranche, second-lien, and mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other equity securities and Structured Finance Securities. We seek to create a diverse portfolio by making investments in the securities of middle-market companies that we expect to range generally from $3.0 million to $25.0 million each, although we expect this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.
Structure of Investments 
We anticipate that our loan portfolio will continue to contain investments of the following types with the following characteristics:
Senior Secured First-Lien Loans. First-lien senior secured loans comprise, and will continue to comprise, a significant portion of our investment portfolio. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans (in certain cases, subject to a payment waterfall). The collateral takes the form of first-priority liens on specified assets of the portfolio company borrower and, typically, first-priority pledges of the ownership interests in the borrower. Our first lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity.
Senior Secured Unitranche Loans. Unitranche loans are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt into one loan under which the borrower pays a single blended interest rate that is intended to reflect the relative risk of the secured and unsecured components. We typically structure our unitranche loans as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company and, typically, first-priority pledges of the ownership interests in the company. We believe that unitranche lending represents a significant growth opportunity for us, offering the borrower the convenience of dealing with one lender, which may result in a higher blended rate of interest to us than we might realize in a traditional multi-tranche structure. Unitranche loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Unitranche loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In many cases, we will be the sole lender, or we, together with our affiliates, will be the sole lender, of unitranche loans, which can afford us additional influence with a borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediation in the event of under performance. 
Senior Secured Second-Lien Loans. Second-lien senior secured loans obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral typically takes the form of second-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company, and we may enter into an inter-creditor agreement with the holders of the portfolio company’s first-lien senior secured debt. These loans typically provide for no contractual loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with all amortization deferred until loan maturity. 
Broadly Syndicated Loans. Broadly Syndicated Loans (whose features are similar to those described under “Senior Secured First-Lien Loans” and “Senior Secured Second-Lien Loans” above), also commonly referred to as leveraged loans, are typically originated and structured by banks on behalf of large corporate borrowers with employee counts, revenues, EBITDA and enterprise values larger than the middle-market characteristics described above. The proceeds of Broadly Syndicated Loans are often used for leveraged buyout transactions, mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and financing capital expenditures. Broadly Syndicated Loans are typically distributed by the arranging bank to a diverse group of investors primarily consisting of: CLOs; senior secured loan and high yield bond mutual funds; closed-end funds, hedge funds, banks, and insurance companies; and finance companies. A borrower must comply with various covenants contained in a loan agreement 
or note purchase agreement between the borrower and the holders of the Broadly Syndicated Loan (the “Loan Agreement”). In a typical Broadly Syndicated Loan, an administrative agent (the “Agent”) administers the terms of the Loan Agreement. In such cases, the Agent is normally responsible for the collection of principal and interest payments from the borrower and the apportionment of these payments to the credit of all institutions that are parties to the Loan Agreement. We will generally rely upon the Agent or an intermediate participant to receive and forward to us our portion of the principal and interest payments on the Broadly Syndicated Loan. Additionally, we normally will rely on the Agent and the other loan investors to use appropriate credit remedies against the borrower. The Agent is typically responsible for monitoring compliance with covenants contained in the Loan Agreement based upon reports prepared by the borrower. The Agent may monitor the value of the collateral and, if the value of the collateral declines, may accelerate the Broadly Syndicated Loan, may give the borrower an opportunity to provide additional collateral or may seek other protection for the benefit of the participants in the Broadly Syndicated Loan. The Agent is compensated by the borrower for providing these services under a Loan Agreement, and such compensation may include special fees paid upon structuring and funding the Broadly Syndicated Loan and other fees paid on a continuing basis. The Broadly Syndicated Loans in which we invest may include loans that are considered “covenant-lite” loans, because of their lack of a full set of financial maintenance covenants. 
The above loan types (Senior Secured First-Lien Loans, Senior Secured Unitranche Loans, Senior Secured Second-Lien Loans, Broadly Syndicated Loans) are categorized as Senior Secured Loans in our consolidated schedule of investments included in "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Subordinated (“Mezzanine”) Loans. These investments are typically structured as unsecured, subordinated loans that typically provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically will have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to maturity. Mezzanine loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Mezzanine investments are generally more volatile than secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal. Mezzanine loans often include a PIK feature (meaning a feature allowing for the payment of interest in the form of additional principal amount of the loan instead of in cash), which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, thereby increasing credit risk exposure over the life of the loan. 
The above loans are categorized as Subordinated Loans in our consolidated schedule of investments included in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Equity Securities. Equity securities typically consist of either a direct minority equity investment in common or membership/partnership interests or preferred stock of a portfolio company, and are typically not control-oriented investments. Our preferred equity investments typically contain a fixed dividend yield based on the par value of the equity security. Preferred equity dividends may be paid in cash at a stipulated date, usually quarterly (if applicable), and may be participating and/or cumulative. We may structure such equity investments to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights, which grants us the right to register our equity interest when either the portfolio company or another investor in the portfolio company files a registration statement with the SEC to issue securities. Our equity investments typically are made in connection with debt investments to the same portfolio companies. In our consolidated schedule of investments included in Part II, these securities are categorized as preferred equity, common equity or equity participation rights, which are contractual agreements entitling us to certain payments generally attributable to equity ownership and lack features enabling us to direct the operations of the entity (i.e., voting rights). See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Warrants. In some cases, we may receive nominally priced warrants to buy a minority equity interest in the portfolio company in connection with a loan. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a put to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights. These securities are categorized as Warrants in our consolidated schedule of investments included in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Structured Finance Securities. Structured Finance Securities include the mezzanine and subordinated note securities of a CLO, as well as loan accumulation facilities (colloquially referred to as “CLO warehouses”). Subordinated notes (colloquially referred to as “CLO equity securities”) and mezzanine debt, represent beneficial interests in portfolios consisting primarily of below-investment-grade senior secured loans with a large number of distinct underlying U.S. borrowers across various industry sectors. The subordinated note tranches of CLOs are unrated, represent the first loss position in a CLO structure, and are typically leveraged 9 to 13 times which translates to approximately 11% to 8% of a CLO’s capital structure, respectively. The leverage can magnify our gains and losses on such investments. CLO subordinated note securities are entitled 
to recurring distributions which are generally equal to the residual cash flow of payments received from underlying securities after contractual payments to more senior CLO mezzanine debt holders and fund expenses. Economically, a CLO subordinated note security is equity-like in that it represents the residual interest in the CLO assets that bears the ultimate risk of loss and receives the benefits of success, but lacks features enabling its holders to direct the operations of the entity typically associated with equity instruments. Mezzanine debt represents the tranches immediately senior to the subordinated note, is usually rated BB to B, and represents approximately 4% to 7% of a CLO’s capital structure. Mezzanine debt tranches represent the second loss position, and can effectively become the residual interest if assets are insufficient to retire the mezzanine tranche at par. 
CLO warehouses are short- to medium-term finance vehicles intended to aggregate loans for inclusion in a future CLO portfolio. Loan accumulation facilities are typically financed through income notes, representing the first-loss and residual interests in the vehicle, and senior debt. The senior debt of a loan accumulation facility typically leverages the income notes between three and six times prior to a CLO’s pricing and launch. Income notes of loan accumulation facilities have economic risks similar to those applicable to CLO subordinated notes insomuch as they pay returns equal to the income earned on the underlying portfolio less costs and fees incurred on senior financing, manager and other expenses, and bear losses on a first-dollar basis, but lack many of the contractual protections associated with a CLO indenture. Investing in a CLO warehouse does not create an obligation to participate in the CLO contemplated by the warehouse; however, we have generally participated in the CLOs resulting from our CLO warehouse investments. Participation in a CLO warehouse investment may afford us the opportunity to enhance our returns through fee sharing agreements with the CLO collateral managers.
General Structuring Considerations. We tailor the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
•selecting investments that we believe have a very low probability of loss;
•requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk; and
•negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board of directors under some circumstances.
    We expect to hold most of our direct lending debt investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier for various reasons, including, but not limited to, relative value decisions compared to other investment opportunities, liquidity needs and credit risk. In attractive interest rate environments, portfolio companies may also opportunistically refinance our loans prior to maturity.
MANAGEMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS 
Investment Advisory Agreement
    OFS Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act and a wholly owned subsidiary of OFSAM. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement with and subject to the overall supervision of our Board and in accordance with the 1940 Act, OFS Advisor provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, OFS Advisor:
•determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
•assists us in determining what securities we purchase, retain or sell;
•identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and
•executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make.
Management and Incentive Fee
OFS Advisor receives a fee from us consisting of two components—a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity), adjusted for stock issuances and stock purchases, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Base management fees for any partial quarter are prorated based on the number of days in the quarter.
Effective from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022, OFS Advisor agreed to reduce the base management fee attributable to all of the OFSCC-FS Assets (excluding cash). The agreement reduced the base management fee to 0.25% per quarter (1.00% annualized) of the average value of the OFSCC-FS Assets (excluding cash), at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. OFS Advisor’s base management fee reduction is renewable on an annual basis and OFS Advisor is not entitled to recoup the amount of the base management fee reduced with respect to the OFSCC-FS Assets. This agreement was renewed for the 2023 calendar year on January 11, 2023.
    The incentive fee has two parts. The first part of the incentive fee (the "Income Incentive Fee") is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. “Pre-incentive fee net investment income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination and sourcing, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest or dividend feature (such as original issue discount, or "OID", debt instruments with PIK interest, equity investments with accruing or PIK dividend, and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized gains, realized losses, unrealized capital appreciation or unrealized capital depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized capital losses or unrealized investment depreciation. 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed “hurdle rate” of 2.0% per quarter. If market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for OFS Advisor to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate. Pre-incentive fee net investment income fees are prorated for any partial quarter based on the number of days in such quarter. 
We pay OFS Advisor an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
•no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
•100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%) as the “catch-up” provision. The catch-up is meant to provide OFS Advisor with 20.0% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and 
•20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter. 
    The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 
Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income
    The second part of the incentive fee (the “Capital Gains Fee”) is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (a) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and our aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (b) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains. If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee for such year. The Company accrues the Capital Gains Fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains and (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation and (depreciation) is positive. 
The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investments. Unrealized capital appreciation is accrued, but not paid until said appreciation is realized. We accrue the Capital Gains Fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of the net realized capital gains (and losses) plus net unrealized appreciation (and depreciation) is positive. OFS Advisor has excluded from the Capital Gains Fee calculation the realized gain with respect to the step acquisitions resulting from the SBIC Acquisition. The Capital Gains Fee for any partial year is prorated based on the number of days in such year. 
Expenses recognized under the Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, are presented below:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Base management fees | $ | 7,979 | | | $ | 7,669 | | $ | 7,605
Incentive fees: | | | | | 
Income Incentive Fee | 2,276 | | | 2,352 | | | 2,025
Income Incentive Fee waiver | — | | | — | | | (441)
Capital Gains Fee(1) | (1,916) | | | 1,916 | | | — 

(1) In accordance with GAAP, we are required to include aggregate unrealized appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly basis as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative capital gain incentive fee accrued by the Company was $1.9 million, none of which was payable as a capital gain incentive fee pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we reversed the previously accrued $1.9 million capital gains fees due to a reduction in net unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio. Any payment due under the terms of the current Investment Advisory Agreement is based on the calculation at the end of each calendar year or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement.
Examples of Incentive Fee Calculation 
Example 1—Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee: 
Assumptions 
•Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
•Management fee(2) = 0.44%
•Other estimated expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20% 
(1) Represents a quarter of the 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. 
(2) Represents a quarter of the 1.75% annualized management fee, which became effective October 31, 2013. 
(3) Excludes offering costs associated with the issuance of equity securities. 
Alternative 1
Additional Assumptions
•Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
•Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.61%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee.
Alternative 2
Additional Assumptions
•Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.80%
•Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.16%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee.
Incentive Fee | = | 100% × “Catch-Up” + the greater of 0% AND (20% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income – 2.5%))
 | = | (100% ×(2.16% – 2.0%)) + 0% 
 | = | 100% × 0.16% 
 | = | 0.16% 

Alternative 3
Additional Assumptions
•Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%
•Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.86%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee.
Incentive Fee | = | 100% × “Catch-Up” + the greater of 0% AND (20% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income – 2.5%))
 | = | (100% × (2.5% – 2.0%)) + (20% × (2.86% – 2.5%)) 
 | = | 0.5% + (20% × 0.36%) 
 | = | 0.5% + 0.07% 
 | = | 0.57% 

Example 2—Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:
Alternative 1
Assumptions
•Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)
•Year 2: Investment A is sold for $50 million and fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $32 million
•Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million
•Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee, if any, would be: 
•Year 1: None (no sales transactions)
•Year 2: $6 million (20% multiplied by $30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A)
•Year 3: None; $5 million (20% multiplied by $30 million cumulative realized capital gains less $5 million cumulative unrealized capital depreciation) less $6 million (Capital Gains Fee paid in Year 2)
•Year 4: $200,000; $6.2 million (20% multiplied by $31 million cumulative realized capital gains) less $6 million (Capital Gains Fee paid in Year 2)
Alternative 2
Assumptions
•Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
•Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million
•Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million
•Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million
•Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee, if any, would be: 
•Year 1: None (no sales transactions)
•Year 2: $5 million (20% multiplied by $30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)
•Year 3: $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains on Investment A and Investment C less $3 million cumulative unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) less $5 million (Capital Gains Fee paid in Year 2)
•Year 4: $0.6 million; $7 million (20% multiplied by $35 million (cumulative realized capital gains on Investment A and Investment C)) less $6.4 million (cumulative Capital Gains Fee paid in all prior years)
•Year 5: None; $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains on Investments A and C less $10 million realized capital losses on Investment B)) less $7 million (cumulative Capital Gains Fee paid in all prior years))
Payment of Our Expenses
All investment professionals of OFS Advisor and/or its affiliates, when and to the extent engaged in providing us with investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services, are provided and paid for by OFS Advisor and not by us. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” 
Duration and Termination
Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons” as defined in the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by OFS Advisor and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Structure—We are dependent upon the OFSC senior professionals for our future success and upon their access to the investment professionals and partners of OFSC and its affiliates.” 
Administration Agreement
    Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, OFS Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. OFS Services furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, necessary software licenses and subscriptions and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes maintenance of financial records necessary for the production of reports to our stockholders and all other reports and materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. In addition, OFS Services assists us in determining and publishing our NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, general supervision of the payment of our expenses, and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services provides managerial assistance on our behalf to certain portfolio companies that accept our offer to provide such assistance. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of OFS Services’ overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, information technology, and our allocable portion of the cost of our officers, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, chief accounting officer and their respective staffs. The Administration Agreement may be renewed annually with the approval of our Board, including a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons.” The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. To the extent that OFS Services outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions at cost without incremental profit to OFS Services. 
Expenses recognized under the Administration Agreement with OFS Services for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, are presented below:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 
Administration fees | $1,742 | $1,758 | $1,855

Indemnification 
    The Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement both provide that OFS Advisor, OFS Services and their affiliates’ respective officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders and employees are entitled to indemnification from us from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administration Agreement, except where attributable to willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of such person’s duties or reckless disregard of such person’s obligations and duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administration Agreement.
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory and Administrative Agreements 
    Our Board, including our independent directors, approved the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement at a meeting held on April 5, 2022. In reaching a decision to approve the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 
•the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by OFS Advisor;
•the fee structures of comparable externally managed BDCs that engage in similar investing activities; 
•our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; 
•any existing and potential sources of indirect income to OFS Advisor from its relationship with us and the profitability of that relationship, including through the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
•information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; and 
•the organizational capability and financial condition of OFS Advisor and its affiliates. 
Based on the information reviewed and the discussion thereof, the Board, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 
Our Board also reviewed services provided under the Administrative Agreement, and approved its continuation at the April 5, 2022 meeting. 
License Agreement 
    We have entered into a license agreement with OFSAM under which OFSAM has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “OFS”. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the “OFS” name for so long as OFS Advisor or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “OFS” name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor is in effect.
REGULATION 
General
    We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act.
In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities” as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
We generally cannot issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV of our common stock if (1) our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and (2) our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities. On July 13, 2022, our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us, with approval of our Board, to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock (during a twelve-month period) at a price below our then-current NAV per share in one or more offerings, subject to certain limitations (including that the cumulative number of shares sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25% of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale).
 The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. On August 4, 2020, we received the Order, which superseded a previous order that we received on October 12, 2016, and provides us with greater flexibility to enter into co-investment transactions with Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We are generally permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds if, under the terms of the Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. 
 In addition, we may file an application for an amendment to our existing Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with private funds that do not hold any investments in such existing portfolio companies. However, if filed, there is no guarantee that such application will be granted.
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the 
publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Prior to January 19, 2021, except for registered money market funds, we generally were prohibited from acquiring more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, investing more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company, or investing more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company without obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC. However, the SEC adopted new rules, which became effective on January 19, 2021, that allow us to acquire the securities of other investment companies in excess of the 3%, 5%, and 10% limitations without obtaining exemptive relief if we comply with certain conditions. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses as they will be indirectly responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of our investment policies are fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval. 
Qualifying Assets 
    Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than those listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets,” unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets, as defined by the 1940 Act. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business include:
(a)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that: 
•is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
•is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
•satisfies any of the following:
◦does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a $250 million market capitalization maximum; or 
◦is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
◦is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
(b)Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control; 
(c)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements; 
(d)Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company; 
(e)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; and 
(f)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. 
Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. 
The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
    A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (a), (b) or (c) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance, although this may not be the sole method by which the BDC satisfies the requirement to make available managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. With respect to an SBIC, providing a loan to a portfolio company satisfies the requirement to make managerial assistance available.
Temporary Investments 
In addition to investing in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may include cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets, as defined by the 1940 Act, are qualifying assets or temporary investments. We may invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, and U.S. Treasury bills or repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. Consequently, repurchase agreements are functionally similar to loans. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, the 1940 Act and certain diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. OFS Advisor monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Warrants and Options 
    Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our Board approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of OFS Capital and its stockholders and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
Senior Securities 
A BDC generally is not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing it has an asset coverage ratio for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). However, Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act provides that a BDC may reduce its asset coverage ratio, provided that certain conditions are met. Specifically, Section 61(a)(2) provides that in order for a BDC whose common stock is traded on a national securities exchange to be subject to 150% asset coverage, the BDC must either obtain: (i) approval of the required majority of its non-interested directors who have no financial interest in the proposal, which would become effective one year after the date of such approval, or (ii) obtain stockholder approval (of more than 50% of the votes cast for the proposal at a meeting in which quorum is present), which would become effective on the first day after the date of such stockholder approval. 
On May 3, 2018, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the application of Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and, as a result, effective May 3, 2019, the asset coverage ratio test applicable to us was decreased from 200% to 150%. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Structure — Because we received the approval of our Board, we became subject to 150% Asset Coverage effective May 3, 2019.” Additionally, effective November 26, 2013, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to exclude our SBA guaranteed debentures from the definition of senior securities in the statutory asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act. 
    We may borrow money when the terms and conditions available are favorable to do so and are aligned with our investment strategy and portfolio composition. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock to make investments would have its own specific benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock.    
    For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to BDCs —Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to and the way in which we raise additional capital. As a BDC, we will need to raise additional capital, which will expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.”
Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Nasdaq Global Select Market Corporate Governance Regulations 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders, many of which affect us. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor, and take actions necessary to ensure, our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
In addition, the Nasdaq Global Select Market has adopted various corporate governance requirements as part of its listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor, and take actions necessary to ensure, our compliance with all future listing standards. 
Exemptive Relief
 We are generally prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the BDC prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit all “joint transactions” between entities that share a common investment adviser. Further, the 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. 
 On August 4, 2020, we received the Order, which superseded a previous order that we received on October 12, 2016, and provides us with greater flexibility to enter into co-investment transactions with certain Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We are generally permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds if under the terms of the Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
 In addition, we may file an application for an amendment to our existing Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain private funds that do not hold any investments even if such other funds had not previously invested in such existing portfolio companies. However, if filed, there is no guarantee that such application will be granted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Structure—Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted, which may limit the scope of investments available to us.”
The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. As a result, unless under the Order, we only expect to co-invest on a concurrent basis with certain funds advised by OFS Advisor when each of us will own the same securities of the issuer and when no term is negotiated other than price. Any such investment would be made, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and OFS Advisor’s allocation policy. If opportunities arise that would otherwise be appropriate for us and for another fund advised by OFS Advisor to invest in different securities of the same issuer, OFS Advisor will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. The decision by OFS Advisor to allocate an opportunity to another entity could cause us to forego an investment opportunity that we otherwise would have made. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which another fund advised by OFS Advisor has previously invested.
Small Business Investment Company Regulations 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, SBIC I LP, is an SBIC and must comply with SBA regulations.
SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. The SBIC license enabled SBIC I LP to receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA 
and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid without penalty twice each year on certain dates. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. 
The investments of an SBIC are limited to loans to, and equity securities of, eligible small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses generally include businesses that (together with their affiliates) have a tangible net worth (total assets less goodwill less total liabilities) not exceeding $19.5 million and have average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $6.5 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote 25% of its investment activity to “smaller concerns,” as defined by the SBA. A smaller concern generally includes businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and have average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $2.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any net carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative criteria to determine eligibility, which may include, among other things, the industry in which the business is engaged, the number of employees of the business, its gross sales, and the extent to which the SBIC is proposing to participate in a change of ownership of the business. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. 
The SBA prohibits an SBIC from providing funds to small businesses for certain purposes, such as relending, real estate or investing in companies outside of the United States, and from providing funds to businesses engaged in a few prohibited industries and to certain “passive” (i.e., non-operating) companies. In addition, without prior SBA approval, an SBIC may not invest an amount equal to more than approximately 30% of the SBIC’s regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates. 
SBICs must invest idle funds that are not being used to make investments permitted under SBA regulations in the following limited types of securities: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (ii) repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less (and the securities underlying the repurchase obligations must be direct obligations of or guaranteed by the federal government); (iii) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; (iv) a deposit account in a federally insured institution that is subject to a withdrawal restriction of one year or less; (v) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (vi) a reasonable petty cash fund. 
SBA regulations include restrictions on a “change of control” or other transfers of limited partnership interests in an SBIC. 
SBIC I LP is subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants.
The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the SBIC I LP’s assets over our stockholders in the event that SBIC I LP is liquidated or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA debentures issued by SBIC I LP in the event of a default. 
In addition, SBIC I LP may also be limited in its ability to make distributions to us if it does not have sufficient accumulated net profit, in accordance with SBA regulations. Income distributions from SBIC I LP are limited to a statutory measurement of “retained earnings available for distribution” (“READ”) which generally is measured by adjusting undistributed net realized earnings for unrealized depreciation on investments, calculated in accordance with SBA regulations. Additionally, return of capital distributions from SBIC I LP require the pre-approval of the SBA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, SBIC I LP distributed READ and return of capital distributions to us of $9.5 million and $9.5 million, respectively.
As part of our plans to focus on providing first lien senior secured loans to larger borrowers, which we believe will improve our overall risk profile, SBIC I LP is repaying over time its outstanding SBA debentures prior to their scheduled maturity dates. As such, we are not making investments through SBIC I LP, other than follow-on investments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not make any new investments through SBIC I LP and made a $2.4 million follow-on investment in a portfolio company.
Other 
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. 
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to OFS Capital or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
We and OFS Advisor each have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, will review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
Our internet address is www.ofscapital.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
Codes of Ethics 
We and OFS Advisor have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to either code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. Our code of ethics is available, free of charge, on our website at www.ofscapital.com. The code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to OFS Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of OFS Advisor are set out below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by OFS Advisor and our directors who are not “interested persons,” and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these proxy voting policies and procedures described below, “we,” “our” and “us” refer to OFS Advisor. 
Introduction. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
Proxy Policies. We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities held by our clients. In most cases we will vote in favor of proposals that we believe are likely to increase the economic value of the underlying portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
Our proxy voting decisions are made by those senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients’ investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, we will disclose such conflicts to our client, including with respect to OFS Capital, those directors who are not interested persons and we may request guidance from such persons on how to vote such proxies for their account. 
Proxy Voting Records. You may obtain information about how we voted proxies for the Company free of charge, by making a written request for proxy voting information to: OFS Capital Corporation, 10 S. Wacker Drive, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attention: Investor Relations, or by calling OFS Capital Corporation at (847) 734-2000. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains such information. 
Privacy Principles 
    We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator).
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of OFS Advisor and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
    Election to be Taxed as a RIC. We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we are not required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our otherwise taxable earnings and profits. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements, as described below. In addition, to receive RIC tax treatment, we must meet the Annual Distribution Requirement. The excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses, if any ("Net Capital Gains"), are not a component of the Annual Distribution Requirement, but impacts taxable income if not distributed as discussed below. 
    Taxation as a RIC. If we:
•maintain our qualification as a RIC; and 
•satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; 
then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our ICTI or Net Capital Gains we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any ICTI or Net Capital Gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
We are also subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year (or, if we so elect, for that calendar year) and (3) any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We may choose to retain a portion of our ordinary income and/or capital gain net income in any year and pay the 4% U.S. federal excise tax on the retained amounts. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we accrued U.S. federal excise taxes of $0.1 million, $0 and $0, respectively.
In order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, certain payments with respect to loans of stock and securities, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, or foreign currencies and other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” as such term is defined in the Code (the "90% Income Test"); and 
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and 
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that we control (as determined under applicable tax rules) and that are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses or of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the “Diversification Tests”). 
We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income taxes, franchise taxes, or withholding liabilities. 
We are required to recognize ICTI in circumstances in which we have not received a corresponding payment in cash. For example, we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as issued with OID and debt instruments with PIK interest, and we must include in ICTI each year the portion of the OID and PIK interest that accrues for that year (as it accrues over the life of the obligation), irrespective of whether the cash representing such income is received by us in that taxable year. The continued recognition of non-cash ICTI may cause difficulty in meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement. We may be required to sell investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, or forgo new investment opportunities to meet this requirement. If we are not able to obtain 
cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 
We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. See “Regulation—Senior Securities.”
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise qualify for the dividends received deduction or constitute qualified dividend income as ineligible for such treatment, (2) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (3) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (4) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (5) cause us to recognize income or gain without receipt of a corresponding distribution of cash, (6) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (7) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (8) produce income that will not be considered "qualifying income" for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions, but there can be no assurance that any adverse effects of these provisions will be mitigated.
Our investments in Structured Finance Securities are generally “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) investments, which can subject us to U.S. federal income tax on our allocable share of a portion of any “excess distribution” received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares even if our allocable share of such income is distributed as a taxable dividend to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest generally would also be imposed on us for the deemed delay in our reporting of such excess distribution and the earning of such income by the underlying PFIC. However, we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, to treat our investments in PFICs as “qualified electing funds” under the Code (a “QEF”), and in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. In lieu of a QEF election, we may in the future elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income our allocable share of any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss our allocable share of any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases included in its income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. 
Some of the income and fees that we recognize may result in income that will not be "qualifying income" for the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may recognize such income and fees directly or indirectly through one or more entities taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations are required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately reduces our return on such income and fees. OFSCC-MB, our fully taxable subsidiary, held equity investments with an aggregate fair value of $3.0 million and $3.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to prevent such non-qualifying income from adversely affecting our RIC status. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, OFSCC-MB paid approximately $0.5 million and $-0-, respectively, of federal income taxes on its earnings and profits.
    Failure to Qualify as a RIC. If we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC, we will be subject to tax on all of our ICTI and Net Capital Gains at regular corporate rates; we will not receive a dividend deduction for any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that would, for qualifying non-corporate U.S. stockholders, be eligible for the current 20% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (subject to limitations under the Code). Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis (reducing that basis accordingly), and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year. 
Conflicts of Interests
    BDCs generally are prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with their affiliates without the prior approval of their independent directors and, in some cases, of the SEC. Those transactions include purchases and sales, and so-called “joint” transactions, in which a BDC and one or more of its affiliates engage in certain types of profit-making activities. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of a BDC’s outstanding voting securities will be considered an affiliate of the BDC for purposes of the 1940 Act, and a BDC generally is prohibited from engaging in purchases from, sales of assets to, or joint transactions with, such affiliates, absent the prior approval of the BDC’s independent directors. Additionally, without the approval of the SEC, a BDC is prohibited from engaging in purchases from, sales of assets to, or joint transactions with, the BDC’s officers, directors, and employees, and advisor (and its control affiliates). 
    BDCs may, however, invest alongside certain related parties or their respective other clients in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with current law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, a BDC may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting the BDC and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that the BDC’s advisor, acting on the BDC’s behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price. Co-investment with such other accounts is not permitted or appropriate under this guidance when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer or where the different investments could be expected to result in a conflict between the BDC’s interests and those of other accounts. 
    Conflicts Related to Portfolio Investments. Conflicts may arise when we make an investment in conjunction with an investment being made by an Affiliated Account, or in a transaction where an Affiliated Account has already made an investment. Investment opportunities are, from time to time, appropriate for more than one account in the same, different or overlapping securities of a portfolio company’s capital structure. Conflicts arise in determining the terms of investments, particularly where these accounts may invest in different types of securities in a single portfolio company. Questions arise as to whether payment obligations and covenants should be enforced, modified or waived, or whether debt should be restructured, modified or refinanced. 
    We may invest in debt and other securities of companies in which Affiliated Accounts hold those same securities or different securities, including equity securities. In the event that such investments are made by us, our interests will at times conflict with the interests of such Affiliated Accounts, particularly in circumstances where the underlying company is facing financial distress. Decisions about what action should be taken, particularly in troubled situations, raise conflicts of interest, including, among other things, whether or not to enforce claims, whether or not to advocate or initiate a restructuring or liquidation inside or outside of bankruptcy, and the terms of any work-out or restructuring. The involvement of Affiliated Accounts at both the equity and debt levels could inhibit strategic information exchanges among fellow creditors, including among us or Affiliated Accounts. In certain circumstances, we or an Affiliated Account may be prohibited from exercising voting or other rights and may be subject to claims by other creditors with respect to the subordination of their interest.
    In the event that we or an Affiliated Account has a controlling or significantly influential position in a portfolio company, that account may have the ability to elect some or all of the board of directors of such a portfolio company, thereby controlling the policies and operations of such portfolio company, including the appointment of management, future issuances of securities, payment of dividends, incurrence of debt and entering into extraordinary transactions. In addition, a controlling account is likely to have the ability to determine, or influence, the outcome of operational matters and to cause, or prevent, a change in control of such a company. Such management and operational decisions may, at times, be in direct conflict with other accounts that have invested in the same portfolio company that do not have the same level of control or influence over the portfolio company. 
    If additional capital is necessary as a result of financial or other difficulties, or to finance growth or other opportunities, the accounts may or may not provide such additional capital, and if provided each account will supply such additional capital in such amounts, if any, as determined by OFS Advisor. In addition, a conflict arises in allocating an investment opportunity if the potential investment target could be acquired by us, an Affiliated Account, or a portfolio company of an Affiliated Account. Investments by more than one account of OFS Advisor or its affiliates in a portfolio company also raise the risk of using assets of an account of OFS Advisor or its affiliates to support positions taken by other accounts of OFS Advisor or its affiliates, or that an account may remain passive in a situation in which it is entitled to vote. In addition, there may be differences in timing of entry into, or exit from, a portfolio company for reasons such as differences in strategy, existing portfolio or liquidity needs, different account mandates or fund differences, or different securities being held. These variations in timing may be detrimental to us.
    The application of our or an Affiliated Account's governing documents and the policies and procedures of OFS Advisor are expected to vary based on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each investment by two or more accounts, in particular when those accounts are in different classes of an issuer’s capital structure (as well as across multiple 
issuers or borrowers within the same overall capital structure) and, as such, there may be a degree of variation and potential inconsistencies, in the manner in which potential or actual conflicts are addressed.
    Co-Investment with Affiliates. On August 4, 2020, we received the Order, which superseded a previous order that we received on October 12, 2016, and provides us with greater flexibility to enter into co-investment transactions with certain Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. We are generally permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds if under the terms of the Order, a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
 In addition, we may file an application for an amendment to our existing Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain private funds that do not hold any investments in such existing portfolio companies. However, if filed, there is no guarantee that such application will be granted.
    When we invest alongside Affiliated Accounts, OFS Advisor will, to the extent consistent with applicable law, regulatory guidance, or the Order, allocate investment opportunities in accordance with its allocation policy. Under this allocation policy, if two or more investment vehicles with similar or overlapping investment strategies are in their investment periods, an available opportunity will be allocated based on the provisions governing allocations of such investment opportunities in the relevant organizational, offering or similar documents, if any, for such investment vehicles. In the absence of any such provisions, OFS Advisor will consider the following factors and the weight that should be given with respect to each of these factors:
•investment guidelines and/or restrictions, if any, set forth in the applicable organizational, offering or similar documents for the investment vehicles; 
•the status of tax restrictions and tests and other regulatory restrictions and tests; 
•risk and return profile of the investment vehicles; 
•suitability/priority of a particular investment for the investment vehicles; 
•if applicable, the targeted position size of the investment for the investment vehicles; 
•level of available cash for investment with respect to the investment vehicles; 
•total amount of funds committed to the investment vehicles; and 
•the age of the investment vehicles and the remaining term of their respective investment periods, if any.
When not relying on the Order, priority as to opportunities will generally be given to clients that are in their “ramp-up” period, or the period during which the account has yet to reach sufficient scale such that its investment income covers its operating expenses, over the accounts that are outside their ramp-up period but still within their investment or re-investment periods. However, application of one or more of the factors listed above, or other factors determined to be relevant or appropriate, may result in the allocation of an investment opportunity to a fund no longer in its ramp-up period over a fund that is still within its ramp-up period. 
    In situations where co-investment with Affiliated Accounts is not permitted or appropriate, OFS Advisor will need to decide which account will proceed with the investment. The decision by OFS Advisor to allocate an opportunity to another entity could cause us to forego an investment opportunity that we otherwise would have made. These restrictions, and similar restrictions that limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates, may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us.
