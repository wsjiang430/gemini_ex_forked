 Overview
 Omega Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a new class of programmable epigenetic mRNA medicines. Our OMEGA platform harnesses the power of epigenetics and our deep understanding of genomic architecture to precisely target and controllably modulate gene expression at the pre-transcriptional level to treat or cure diseases. We have deciphered the three-dimensional architecture of the human genome. Genes and their accompanying regulators are organized into distinct and evolutionarily conserved structures called Insulated Genomic Domains, or IGDs. IGDs are the fundamental structural and functional units of gene control and cell differentiation and collectively act as nature’s innate control system. Most diseases are caused by aberrant gene expression rooted in alterations in IGDs. The OMEGA platform has enabled us to systematically identify and validate thousands of novel and unique DNA-sequence-based epigenomic “zip codes” associated with individual regulatory elements within IGDs. We call these epigenomic targets EpiZips. We rationally design and engineer our mRNA therapeutics, which are programmable and modular epigenetic medicines, called Omega Epigenomic Controllers, or OECs, to target EpiZips for Precision Epigenomic Control. This enables us to precisely tune genes to a desired level of expression and to control the duration of expression. Through this approach, we believe that the OMEGA platform has broad potential applicability across a range of diseases, processes and conditions. Our pipeline currently consists of early-stage programs that span oncology, multigenic diseases including immunology, regenerative medicine, and select monogenic diseases.
We believe that the Precision Epigenomic Control delivered by the OMEGA platform has broad therapeutic applicability and transformational potential, initially spanning across:
•Oncology. Control of target oncogenes including historically challenging, auto-regulatory or un-druggable targets in various cancers. 
 •Multigenic diseases including immunology. Regulation of multiple genes within an IGD or across IGDs. 
 •Regenerative medicine. Recapitulation of developmental and mature-state gene expression to drive cellular regeneration and restore normal function. 
 •Select monogenic diseases. Correction of dysregulation in monogenic rare and non-rare diseases. 


Our Pipeline
 Our current pipeline consists of the following programs:


Intellectual Property and Manufacturing Capabilities
We have consolidated a significant intellectual property estate covering the OMEGA platform and our OECs through our own development activities and through licenses from the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or the Whitehead Institute. We are also developing internal and external manufacturing capabilities, including evaluating plans to build our own facility, to provide appropriate scale and quality to support development and commercialization of our OECs.
Our Strategy
 Our objective is to become the leading programmable epigenetic medicines company by engineering, developing, manufacturing, and commercializing OECs, utilizing the OMEGA platform. Our vision is to treat and cure serious diseases by selectively and safely directing the human genome to control gene expression pre-transcriptionally without altering native DNA sequences.
 Our strategy includes:
•Strategically invest in and advance the OMEGA platform. Our scientific and technical expertise and expansive intellectual property estate have enabled us to develop our industry-leading, pioneering OMEGA platform. We plan to continue to invest in expanding our knowledge of IGD biology and epigenetics in order to identify new DNA-sequence-based epigenomic targets, the EpiZips, further our capacity to innovate and engineer OECs, expand our technologies, broaden our delivery capabilities, and enhance our institutionalized knowledge to further solidify our position as a leading digital and data-driven epigenetic medicines company. We plan to build additional computational, big-data, and advanced-analytic capabilities to maintain our leadership position. We plan to expand and strengthen our position as leaders in developing mRNA therapeutics for epigenomic control.
 •Establish OECs as a new class of programmable epigenetic mRNA medicines. Through the breadth of our research-and-development activities and the pursuit of high-value biological targets, we seek to demonstrate the unprecedented therapeutic potential of our OECs and to expand our repertoire of OECs that can be used for therapeutic applications. We have conducted in vivo preclinical studies of 


our OECs in multiple disease models for various indications, including hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and we expect to conduct in vivo preclinical studies for multiple additional programs. We have initiated clinical development for the HCC program and IND-enabling studies for our NSCLC program.
 •Expand our pipeline through internal and partnering efforts. We believe the OMEGA platform can be used to create therapeutics to treat a broad array of human diseases by regulating the expression of single or multiple genes. Internally, we intend to focus our development and commercialization efforts in areas of high unmet need with well-defined and circumscribed patient populations. At the same time, we plan to seek collaborations or co-development arrangements to mitigate development risk or gain access to novel delivery technologies. 
 •Build a fully integrated digitalized biopharmaceutical company. Our intent is to develop a world-class biopharmaceutical company by leveraging our innate and differentiated platform attributes and digitalized end-to-end capabilities across research, discovery, preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial operations. We believe the integrated and modular nature of the OMEGA platform enables iterative learnings and insights for efficient, evidence-based decision making to optimize the engineering, development, and selection of our OEC candidates. 
 •Curate world-class talent and culture. Our culture is guided by our overarching ethos: Ambitious, yet humble. Our unparalleled motivation to transform human medicine through our pioneering work is combined with our underlying sense of humility, which is essential for keeping patients front and center. Given the pioneering nature of our business, identifying, nurturing, developing, and retaining leading talent is a critical element of our strategy. 
 Background on Insulated Genomic Domains (IGDs)
Epigenetics is the mechanism that systematically controls every aspect of an organism’s life from cell growth and differentiation to cell death. Our team has developed an understanding of the universal operating system of epigenetics and has built the OMEGA platform to replicate nature’s method of gene control for therapeutic benefit. IGDs are key to understanding the organization of this operating system and act as the fundamental structural and functional units of gene control and cell differentiation. There are approximately 15,000 IGDs that encompass the roughly 20,000 genes that are distributed across our 23 chromosomes. They are ubiquitous in every cell and evolutionarily conserved within and largely across species.
Gene expression in cells is generally controlled by a highly diverse class of regulatory elements, such as enhancers, repressors and promoters. These regulatory elements are relatively short segments of DNA that act as binding sites for protein transcription factors that in turn recruit other proteins to activate transcription of targeted genes. Current research indicates that genes and their associated regulatory elements reside in a modular fashion within IGDs. The chromosomal-looping structure of IGDs ensures that interactions between genes and their regulatory elements are insulated from neighboring IGDs and extraneous regulatory factors, which is critical for ensuring normal cell-specific gene regulation. The CCCTC-binding factor, CTCF, and the cohesin complex are critical players in the formation and maintenance of the IGD structure. Cohesin is the motor

that extrudes and enlarges the IGD loop, while CTCF blocks cohesin from further extrusion and acts as an anchor, thereby enforcing boundaries between IGDs.
Graphical Representation of an IGD


IGDs encompass protein-coding genes and their regulatory elements. A single IGD typically contains between one and ten genes, with a median of three genes. Epigenomic controllers are designed to affect the expression of genes within specific IGDs through precise modulation of one or more IGD components (EpiZips) to control gene expression. Controllers can also be multiplexed to target multiple IGDs.
Any perturbation of an IGD or its boundary has the potential to cause the dysregulation of one or all genes inside it, giving rise to a range of disease states. Alterations of IGDs, which can be either structural or functional in nature, include mutations or disruptions in anchor-CTCF binding sequences, gene promoters, and enhancer regions (including super-enhancers). For example, mutations in the coding sequences for CTCF and cohesin have been observed in various solid-tumor cancers, including breast, prostate, and kidney cancer, as well as in leukemia. IGD boundary alterations may consist of the aberrant inclusion or exclusion of regulatory elements or genes. For example, in some cancers, disruption of the IGD boundary can rewire loop interactions to include strong activating regulatory elements called super-enhancers to upregulate an oncogene. Similar activation can be found in cases of genetic inversion and translocation. Epigenomic changes at the IGD boundary, for example aberrant DNA methylation, can alter CTCF binding and lead to gene exclusion or expose genes within the IGD to external regulatory elements. Pathological evidence of this disruption has been identified in cancers, such as gliomas, and in inherited human diseases, such as Fragile X syndrome.
OMEGA Platform
We believe that the OMEGA platform represents an unprecedented approach to developing therapeutics to treat the epigenetic basis of disease by precisely controlling gene expression without altering native DNA sequences. We believe that our OECs’ ability to precisely target and provide controlled tunable and durable effects has the potential to treat a wide range of diseases.
The OMEGA platform consists of four pillars.
1. Proprietary Database of IGDs and EpiZips
We utilize a biology-first approach to target identification starting with validated gene targets linked to a disease indication of interest. We use proprietary algorithms and machine-learning tools to mine our own and

public databases to develop a comprehensive profile of the target IGD to understand how it is dysregulated in diseased states. We synthesize this information to determine the key therapeutic intervention points, the EpiZips, to be targeted with OECs to achieve the desired effect on gene expression. Through this process, we have built an expansive library of thousands of EpiZips and IGDs as potential therapeutic targets.
2. Programmable and Modular Epigenetic mRNA Medicines (OECs) Tailored to Disease
 We have created a modular basis for efficient and intelligent design of programmable epigenetic medicines, the OECs. These prospectively engineered investigational medicines allow us to regulate multiple genes with exquisite specificity, controllable tuning, and duration of effect. Our OECs are programmable mRNA therapeutics that express fusion proteins comprised of two components—a DNA-binding domain and an epigenomic effector protein, as shown in the figure below. The DNA-binding domain is designed to target a particular EpiZip with exquisite specificity. The epigenomic effector protein is designed to interact with DNA or DNA-associated proteins within the cell nucleus, such as histones and transcription factors, to up- or down-regulate gene expression and control the duration of effect. We use proprietary algorithms to design our OECs, including programming DNA-binding domains and selecting optimal epigenomic effector proteins. These computational tools allow us to efficiently generate numerous potential OECs and increases our ability to engineer OECs to treat a particular target.
Omega Epigenomic Controller (OEC)*
 

*mRNA medicines expressed as proteins in cell nucleus
We are currently developing proprietary zinc-finger-like proteins and other DNA-binding domains. For epigenomic effectors, we have generated and continue to build a library consisting of more than 100 single- and multi-functional epigenomic effector domains, including both naturally occurring and proprietary engineered variants of DNA-modifying factors, histone-modifying factors, and other chromatin-remodeling factors.
The initial identification of IGDs, EpiZips, and the mechanism of action for OECs directed to particular target genes are rapidly validated utilizing epigenomic controller screens. Our modular design approach allows us to accelerate our discovery process and to identify gene targets and generate initial lead OECs to modulate them in potentially as little as a few weeks.
3. Engineered, Customized Drug Delivery to Target Tissues and Cells
 Delivery to the appropriate cells and tissues is critical to the successful application of our technology. We are exploring and innovating a multitude of delivery methods.

We have chosen lipid-nanoparticle-, or LNP-, delivery technology validated in third-party clinical trials for our initial programs. LNPs are currently used in products, both approved and in development. We have deep expertise in delivery formulations and leverage technological improvements and established regulatory precedents to develop our own LNPs. We are delivering our OECs as mRNA, which encodes the DNA binding domain and epigenetic effector proteins, encapsulated within a LNP. Our LNPs are typically 3- or 4-component molecules that encapsulate nucleic acids like mRNA, protect and transport them to organs and tissues within the body, and facilitate their uptake into cells. We believe our LNPs are capable of providing re-dosable, non-viral, in vivo delivery to the liver, lung, central nervous system, immune cells, joints, and other cells and tissues. Once taken up into cells, the LNP enables release of the mRNA cargo into the cytoplasm where it is translated into the OEC, which, in turn, is transported to the nucleus and binds to the targeted EpiZip within the specified IGD. We are currently exploring a range of cationic and ionizable LNPs from various internal and external sources and have developed proprietary LNP formulations that have shown specific and efficient in vivo functional delivery in preclinical studies.
4. Industry-Leading Computational, Biological, and Genomic Expertise
We leverage codified learnings and insights gleaned from our lead programs to continue optimizing our platform and inform the discovery and development of subsequent product candidates. We have also established and continue to add to our knowledge bank of EpiZips and OECs. We take a rational and streamlined approach to the development of programmable epigenetic medicines to potentially provide a faster path to the clinic through robust and efficient target identification, validation, product-candidate design, and optimization. We are also continually expanding our catalog of EpiZips and novel and proprietary DNA-binding domains and epigenomic effector proteins and using computational methods to assess on-target and potential off-target binding and activity to minimize inadvertent changes in the expression of genes.
Computational Foundation
The OMEGA platform leverages novel biology and epigenetics to therapeutically control gene expression and program cell state through our significant computational capabilities. Decoding the rules of the human genome – one with billions of nucleotides, tens of thousands of genes, and up to a million regulatory sequences, all potentially interacting in 3-dimensional space – requires the creation of advanced proprietary algorithms and statistical data analysis techniques. Our cutting-edge computational tools are built on a diverse library of proprietary algorithms and deep-learning techniques, which enable us to interpret and predict the location, structure and function of IGDs. The critical scientific insights provided by the OMEGA platform enable the identification of EpiZips across therapeutic areas and indications. This deep in silico understanding and predictability also directly informs the design and rapid engineering of OECs that allow us to regulate single or multiple genes with exquisite specificity, controllable tuning, and duration of effect.
We apply our computational technology throughout the drug development continuum by broadly applying a computation- and data-first approach. We deploy a wide range of systems biology and functional genomics methods to identify relevant biomarkers. We utilize key translational models to validate mechanism of action in order to accelerate development and potentially de-risk clinical translation. Combinatorial optimization techniques and novel discovery efforts enable acceleration of delivery and formulation design. This allows us to rapidly scale programs and manufacturing while improving quality and cost. Systematic data capture and automation have enabled real-time, data-driven decision-making which has further driven our ability to accelerate numerous programs in parallel.
We have a highly skilled computational team with deep expertise and broad experience, supporting the OMEGA platform. This team develops the tools, capabilities, and specialized methods needed to address the complexity of IGD biology, design, and delivery of our OECs, and integration of a computation- and data-first philosophy company wide. We are continually growing and evolving our computational team and capabilities to drive innovation in the discovery and development of programmable epigenetic medicines, manufacturing, and our digital foundation.
 Our Development Programs
Our current pipeline consists of development programs in oncology, multigenic diseases including immunology, regenerative medicine, and select monogenic diseases.

Oncology
OTX-2002 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
We are developing OTX-2002 to downregulate c-Myc, an oncogene that is dysregulated in more than 50% of human cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis, as a potential treatment for patients with advanced HCC. c-Myc has been shown to play a key role in liver cell proliferation and is known to be upregulated in the majority of HCC cases. Drug development aimed at directly targeting c-Myc has proved challenging because its expression is tightly regulated and because it is a protein that lacks a specific active site for small molecule binding. This means that targeting c-Myc mRNA or protein is unlikely to be effective as neither approach addresses the underlying dysregulation at the transcriptional level. Unlike other more binary approaches to downregulation of gene expression, OECs can precisely modulate c-Myc expression enough to kill highly MYC-amplified cancer cells and drive tumor regression, but spare healthy surrounding cells which need only a low level of MYC for normal function.
HCC is a primary liver malignant tumor that develops in a chronic-liver-disease setting. It is typically diagnosed late in its course and the median survival period following diagnosis is approximately six to 20 months. In 2017, there were an estimated 89,950 people living with liver and liver-related cancer in the United States. Depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis, current treatment options include therapies such as surgical resection, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sorafenib, orthotopic liver transplantation or radiofrequency ablation, and for more advanced patients, immune checkpoint plus anti-vascular-endothelial-growth-factor combination therapy, or palliative treatments, such as trans-catheter arterial chemo- or radio-embolization, stereotactic radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy.
When tested in a panel of HCC cell lines, OTX-2002 made epigenetic modifications in precisely targeted regions in the chromosome, leading to a reduction in MYC mRNA levels and driving antiproliferative effects. In preclinical studies utilizing both subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse xenograft models of HCC, OTX-2002 led to significant tumor growth inhibition with no significant impact on body weight change in mice. The antitumor activity was consistent with reduction in MYC protein levels in the tumors. Further, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, OTX-2002 in combination with lenvatinib or sorafenib, the current standard of care agents in HCC, was associated with enhanced inhibition of tumor growth in HCC tumor models.
In a preclinical study of OTX-2002 in various HCC cell lines, OTX-2002 down-regulated c-Myc and we observed loss of cellular viability across targeted HCC subtypes with effects observed for 15 days. As shown in the graph below, the EC50, which measures the concentration of a drug that provides a 50% response between baseline and the maximum response, was measured in five HCC cell lines. Treatment with OTX-2002 resulted in a c-Myc mRNA expression EC50 at a mean value 0.013 ug/mL and a 50% decrease in cell viability at 0.147 ug/mL.
OTX-2002 was associated with a dose-response on expression and viability (in vitro)


In a separate preclinical study of OTX-2002 in an HCC cell line (Hep3B), we demonstrated a selective effect on the viability of cancer cells. As shown in the graph below, treatment of cancer cells with OTX-2002 at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 500 ng/mL resulted in a significant reduction in the viability of these cells at

all doses, where, by contrast, when we treated normal cells (healthy primary human liver hepatocytes) with OTX-2002 we saw no significant impact on cell viability.

OTX-2002 delivered via formulated LNPs in vivo decreased tumor burden in mice containing human HCC xenografts. In this preclinical study, we administered 3 mg/kg OTX-2002 every five days in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model or a small molecule control. As shown in the graph below, treatment with OTX-2002 was associated with a statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth, resulting in a 78% inhibition of tumor growth by Day 13 compared to the negative control. Treatment with OTX-2002 was equivalent to treatment with the small molecule comparator. Mice treated with OTX-2002 did not experience a significant decrease in body weight. OTX-2002 was well tolerated in this study with no adverse events observed.

 *Statistically significant vs negative control, t-test p<0.05 starting on Day 6. OTX-2002 dosed IV every 5 days.
 
In addition, we observed an equivalent effect on tumor growth from OTX-2002 in mice containing human HCC xenografts compared to sorafenib. Mice were administered 3 mg/kg of OTX-2002 every five days or 50

mg/kg of sorafenib once daily. Tumor growth was measured using bioluminescent imaging. As shown in the graph below, treatment with OTX-2002 resulted in a comparable reduction in luminescence as treatment with sorafenib. Mice treated with OTX-2002 did not experience a significant decrease in body weight. Mice treated with sorafenib experienced a sustained loss in body weight. OTX-2002 was well-tolerated in this study with no adverse events observed.

We have also observed statistically significant combination efficacy benefit with checkpoint inhibitors, including both anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents. In evaluation of a mouse surrogate OEC for OTX-2002 in a subcutaneous HCC tumor model (Hepa1-6), groups of immune competent mice were administered 1 mg/kg of the OEC every five days, 10 mg/kg of either anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 weekly, combinations of the OEC and anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1, or a negative control. As shown in the graph below, combination treatment resulted in statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to the negative control, and further, statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to all of the monotherapy treatment arms. Both combination arms were well tolerated with no significant impact on body weight observed during the study.
 





Treatment with OEC in combination with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 anti-tumor activity and body weight observed in HCC xenograft model(in vivo)
 
In vivo treatment of OTX-2002 delivered via formulated LNPs in a mouse subcutaneous human HCC tumor model at a doses of 3 mg/kg every five days resulted in decreased tumor burden and also showed correlated changes in c-Myc expression and associated clinical biomarkers in tumors at the cellular level. As shown in the graph below, immunohistochemistry analysis of histology sections from OEC candidate-treated and negative control tumors harvested from the animals in the in vivo studies described above showed significant downregulation of c-Myc protein in the tumors (indicated by loss of brown staining) as well as the expected downregulation of Ki67 (a biomarker of tumor cell proliferation) and upregulation of Caspase 3 (a biomarker of apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death).
Change in clinical biomarkers observed in HCC xenograft model


In July 2022, we announced clearance of our investigational new drug (“IND”) application from the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") to initiate a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, clinical trial of OTX-2002 for the treatment of HCC.
In October 2022, we announced initiation of the Phase 1/2 MYCHELANGELOTM I clinical trial. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of OTX-2002 as a monotherapy (Part 1) and in combination with standard of care therapies (Part 2) in patients with relapsed or refractory HCC and other solid tumor types known for association with the MYC oncogene. The study is expected to enroll up to 190 patients at clinical trial sites in the United States, Asia, and Europe.


In November 2022, we announced that OTX-2002 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of HCC.
 OTX-2101 for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
In October 2022, we announced the selection of OTX-2101 as a development candidate to advance into IND-enabling studies for the treatment of NSCLC. Approximately 50% of NSCLC tumors overexpress c-Myc. We are developing OTX-2101 to downregulate c-Myc and reduce this overexpression. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of all lung cancer diagnoses, which was approximately 192,200 new cases in the United States in 2020. The five-year survival rate for NSCLC is 24%. Depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis, current treatment options include therapies such as surgical resection, photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy, or brachytherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies (e.g., TKIs) and immunotherapy in combination with other therapies.
We have identified OEC candidates that have shown activity against a range of NSCLC cell lines in vitro in preclinical studies, showing down-regulation of c-Myc with concomitant loss of cellular viability. Importantly, in in vitro preclinical studies, minimal antiproliferative effects in normal primary lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells were observed with these OEC candidates. In addition, the OEC candidates showed synergistic effects on cell proliferation in a preclinical study when treated in combination with clinically relevant TKIs (data not shown). We also conducted preclinical studies in two subcutaneous xenograft models of NSCLC. In these studies, we treated mice with 3 mg/kg of one of our OEC candidates every five days. Treatment with our OEC candidate showed a statistically significant reduction in tumor size during the dosing phase of the study, with no reduction in body weight of treated mice observed. In these two studies, treatment with our OEC candidate was associated with an equivalent effect on tumor volume to treatment with the standards of care, chemotherapy medication used to treat several cancers, as shown in the graphs below.

Change in body weight observed in NSCLC subcutaneous xenograft model (in vivo)

In a panel of NSCLC cell lines, OTX-2101 reduced viability and induced apoptosis, consistent with reduction in MYC mRNA levels. Further analysis of the OTX-2101-treated cells showed specific binding of the mRNA drug substance to its predicted genomic target region and an increase in the expected epigenetic mark(s) at the target site. In preclinical studies in subcutaneous xenograft models of NSCLC, we observed significant inhibition of tumor growth at well tolerated doses of OTX-2101. OTX-2101 showed combination benefit in NSCLC cells in vitro, when treated either with MEK inhibitor (trametinib), or EGFR inhibitor (Osimertinib), which we believe demonstrates OTX-2101’s potential to offer a potential differentiated treatment modality in advanced NSCLC.
 Small Cell Lung Cancer
We are also targeting SCLC through epigenetic control points that down-regulate a gene known to be overexpressed in more than 90% of SCLC due to a common mutation, and also overexpressed in other cancers including breast, lung, acute myeloid leukemia, and gastric cancers. This gene is located in an identified and well-characterized single-gene IGD. SCLC accounts for 15% of all lung cancers and has a five-year survival rate of

6%. Depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis, current treatment options include surgical resection followed by chemotherapy, chemotherapy with radiation, and immunotherapy.
We conducted proprietary algorithmic analysis of the IGD, using a wide range of multi-omic datasets, to identify numerous EpiZip targets and epigenomic effector options. We are generating computationally designed OEC candidates using our OMEGA platform for the potential treatment of SCLC and conducting in vitro testing to determine the final OEC candidate for in vivo testing.
Multigenic Diseases Including Immunology
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
 We are evaluating OEC candidates to reduce expression of the CXCL1, 2, and 3 and IL-8 gene cluster in various potential indications, including inflammatory lung diseases such as neutrophilic asthma and ARDS, dermatological and rheumatological indications, and oncology. Overexpression of the CXCL gene cluster produces chemokines that attract neutrophils and promotes local inflammation. In the case of ARDS, chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells to the lung are of pivotal importance in disease pathogenesis and expression of the CXCL1, 2, 3, and IL-8 gene cluster is elevated in the lung cells of patients with ARDS. ARDS is a devastating syndrome, with an incidence of approximately 200,000 in the United States and a mortality rate approaching 40%.
In a preclinical study of an OEC candidate (Controller A in the graph below) in human monocytes, at 24 hours post-dosing we observed a 65% decrease in gene expression of CXCL1, a 55% decrease in gene expression of CXCL2, an 88% decrease in gene expression of CXCL3, and a 52% decrease in gene expression in IL-8, in each case relative to control.
Multigenic IGD targeting of chemokine genes observed (in vitro)


In a preclinical study in an animal model of ARDS, we observed a significant decrease in neutrophil infiltration in lungs treated with an OEC candidate. Animals were administered 3 mg/kg of the OEC candidate two hours prior and eight hours after lipopolysaccharide insult to induce inflammation or 10 mg/kg dexamethasone daily as a positive control. As shown in the graph below, we observed a 56% decrease in neutrophils infiltration in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (labeled BALF in the graph below) in mice 72 hours after treatment with the OEC candidate relative to disease control, a measure of the severity of the inflammatory response.

* p<0.05 compared to disease control
We also plan to conduct in vivo testing in other models of severe inflammatory disease where the CXCL1, 2 and 3 and IL-8 gene cluster plays a key role, such as neutrophilic dermatosis, paw edema, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
We are evaluating OEC candidates to down-regulate expression of a gene cluster known to be up-regulated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and promote pulmonary fibrosis in animal models. IPF is a rapidly progressive and fatal disease in which the lung loses its functional capacity over time. The global prevalence for IPF is roughly 13 to 20 per 100,000 persons, and there is no known cure. The average patient survival is approximately six years with treatment and three years without treatment. Current treatment options are limited to symptomatic or palliative care, including anti-fibrotics, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, oxygen therapy, and for advanced disease, lung transplant. If we are able to successfully down-regulate expression of this gene cluster in human lung cells, we believe this OEC candidate could also be developed for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, as the same gene cluster is implicated in these indications as well as in IPF.
We have conducted algorithmic analysis, using a wide range of multi-omic datasets, to identify an IGD with an internal structure consisting of seven genes related to IPF controlled through various intra-IGD interactions and regulatory elements. We are generating computationally designed OEC candidates using our OMEGA platform for the potential treatment of IPF and conducting in vitro testing to determine the final OEC candidate for in vivo testing.
Regenerative Medicine
Liver Regeneration
We are developing OEC candidates designed to increase expression of HNF4, a transcriptional master regulator, as a potential way to restore liver-cell function in patients with severe liver dysfunction. HNF4 controls development, differentiation, and homeostasis of hepatocytes and other cell types in the liver by controlling the expression of proteins, such as bilirubin, albumin, and metabolic enzymes, which are essential for normal liver

function. In chronic liver disease, HNF4 is down-regulated, which contributes to the pathology of liver failure. Studies have shown that increased expression of HNF4 in even a modest fraction of hepatocytes can restore healthy liver function.
In 2020, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis were a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for over 50,000 deaths. Depending on the etiology of disease, treatment options may include corticosteroids, antivirals or other drugs, with the final option being liver transplantation. In 2018, in the United States, there were more than 14,000 people on the liver transplant waiting list and approximately 25% died before receiving a transplant.
In preclinical studies in primary healthy human hepatocytes, treatment with our OEC candidate induced a durable increase in HNF4 for up to ten days, which we believe may be sufficient to return hepatocytes to a functional state and restore liver function in CLD and ESLD patients. We also observed decreases in collagen 1A1, or Col1A1, and alpha smooth muscle actin, or SMA, both biomarkers of liver injury and fibrosis, as shown in the graph below. At 72 hours, we observed reductions of approximately 50% in both Col1A1 and SMA relative to untreated cells. These data showed a reduction in expression of these downstream biomarkers of liver damage in response to the up-regulation of HNF4 and support the proposed therapeutic mechanism of action of our OEC candidate.

As shown in the images below, in an in vivo preclinical mouse liver fibrosis model, carbon tetrachloride treatment was used to induce hepatocellular degeneration (labeled CCL4 in the images below). Treatment with a mouse surrogate construct of our OEC candidate showed a significant decrease in hepatocellular degeneration on Days 31 and 38 with either one or two weekly administrations.
Mouse surrogate construct of OEC candidate improved liver histology (in vivo)



We are currently conducting additional in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, formulation optimization, efficacy, and preliminary safety studies of our OEC candidate.
Corneal Regeneration
We are also evaluating OEC candidates to control the expression of multiple potential target genes in patients with diabetes and other conditions to treat corneal epithelial injury. The proteins expressed by these genes have been strongly linked to cell-growth inhibition and shown to be key factors in preventing ocular wound-healing in animal models. Approximately 70% of patients with diabetes suffer from corneal complications, including epithelial fragility, recurrent erosions, ulcers, and delayed or incomplete wound repair. Diabetic retinopathy is currently the leading cause of legal blindness in working age adults worldwide. The condition is mainly treated by attempting to maintain tight blood glucose control. We believe that by tuning these genes, we may be able to facilitate corneal regeneration to treat these corneal complications from diabetes or other conditions.
We have identified an IGD containing a master regulatory gene that has been strongly linked to cell-growth inhibition in patients with diabetes and other conditions. We conducted algorithmic analysis of the IGD, using a wide range of multi-omic datasets, to identify numerous EpiZip targets and epigenomic effector options. Using our OMEGA platform, we are generating computationally designed OEC candidates for the potential treatment of corneal generation and conducting in vitro testing to determine the final OEC candidate for in vivo testing.

Alopecia
We are developing OEC candidates for the treatment of alopecia, a disorder characterized by patches of non-scarring hair loss affecting the scalp and body. We are targeting SFRP1, a protein that inhibits hair growth in alopecia patients, and are developing OEC candidates designed to down-regulate the production of SFRP1. Alopecia areata affects approximately 6.5 million people in the United States and approximately 2% of people worldwide. Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male pattern baldness, is a genetically predetermined disorder caused by excessive response to androgens, which affects up to 50% of males and females. There is currently no cure for either type of alopecia. We are evaluating delivery of our OEC candidates to the hair bulb and assessing our OEC candidates’ effects in ex vivo models of hair growth.
In a preclinical study, we treated patient human papilla cells with an OEC candidate and measured SFRP1 mRNA expression. As shown in the figure below, we observed a 79% to 88% reduction in SFRP1 mRNA expression in cells treated with the OEC candidate compared to control. These effects were observed through Day 7.

Translational Data
A critical element for the clinical translation of our OEC candidates is our ability to design OEC candidates that can target IGDs and tune gene expression across species. In preclinical studies, we evaluated changes in HNF4 expression in non-human primates and in human liver tissue engrafted and grown in a mouse (labeled FRG Mouse in the graph below) treated with our OEC candidate and in healthy mice treated with an OEC candidate designed to target the homologous murine target sequence. As shown in the graph below, we observed therapeutically relevant up-regulation of HNF4 compared to control, with results showing a 246% increase in mice, 68% increase in non-human primates, and 31% increase in the FRG mouse. We believe that this translational fidelity of our mechanism of action supports our continued development of our OEC candidates and programs.

Delivery Data
We have extensive internal formulation, delivery and development expertise in mRNA and LNPs, and are engaged in continuous internal LNP research and development. We are currently exploring a range of LNPs from various internal and external sources and have developed proprietary formulations that have shown specific and efficient in vivo functional delivery of our OEC candidates to a number of therapeutically relevant cell and tissue-types in preclinical studies, as shown in the figure below. The tissue and cell types we can access with our current library of LNP compositions include liver (e.g. hepatocytes, stellate cells, Kupffer cells), lung (e.g. endothelial, alveolar, epithelial), local joints (e.g. synovial layer, chondrocytes, immune cells), and the central nervous system (e.g. spinal cord, brain), as well as tumors (e.g. subcutaneous, orthotopic). Collectively, our current delivery capabilities enable us to develop and expand our pipeline.

Manufacturing
 We view the development of manufacturing capability, capacity, and control as critical to our overall success and specifically to our ability to meet our development timelines, contain operational costs and generate and protect intellectual property for our platform technology and product candidates. Because of this, we have chosen a clinically validated manufacturing and delivery technology with which we have deep internal expertise and which is similar to that being developed for various applications in the fields of vaccine development and gene editing. We are thus able to leverage our own experience, as well as the technological improvements and regulatory precedents established by previous and current products utilizing the same modalities.
Our internal process and analytical development organization has established manufacturing processes at sufficient scale to supply our research and early preclinical development requirements for drug substance and drug product. In addition, we have engaged highly skilled third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, with extensive experience in manufacturing mRNA, our drug substance, and drug product to implement our manufacturing processes at large scale under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. We have established manufacturing services agreement with third-party CDMOs for the supply of drug substance and drug product to meet our needs for preclinical studies, IND-enabling toxicology studies and clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on third-party CDMOs for the supply of drug substance, drug product and finished product for the next several years.


For each of our therapeutic programs, we evaluate the optimal LNP delivery options from both external collaborations and our internal LNP research and development platform. For example, for our lead program, OTX-2002, we have licensed LNP technology from Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc., or Acuitas, a company with extensive LNP intellectual property and a track record of collaborating and developing LNPs for clinical use. We believe our collaborations with external partners will provide significant formulation and manufacturing expertise that will facilitate the transfer of processes for LNP formulation of mRNA under cGMP standards to CDMOs. We are also in the process of engaging additional highly experienced CDMOs to manufacture our product candidates.
We believe that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party CDMOs and current internal facilities to meet our current research, preclinical, and clinical material needs. We believe that the current manufacturing capacity established externally, together with the internal capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for the next several years. We monitor the capacity availability for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our CDMOs and the lead times for new material supply would allow us to access additional capacity to meet our anticipated needs. We also believe that our product can be manufactured at a scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs.
Competition
As an early-stage biotechnology company, we face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. This competition includes both small companies and large companies with greater financial and technical resources and longer operating histories than our own. We also compete with the intellectual property, technology, and product development efforts of academic, governmental, and private research institutions.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they establish collaborative arrangements with large companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of any products that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may commercialize products more quickly than we do.
 We expect to compete with companies developing technologies that focus on gene-expression control using various technologies, such as CRISPR gene editing, gene therapies, non-coding RNA therapeutics, and small molecule epigenetics. These companies include: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Beam Therapeutics Inc., Biogen Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Editas Medicine Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Sangamo Therapeutics Inc.
Further, while we are not aware of other companies developing epigenomic controllers and modulating gene-expression pre-transcriptionally for the treatment of either HCC or NSCLC, several companies are developing therapeutics that use gene-expression control for the treatment of HCC or NSCLC, including Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. / Ascletis Pharma Inc. and Bio-Path Holdings, Inc., which are developing anti-sense inhibitors, Nitto Denko Corporation and Simaomics, Inc., which are developing siRNA inhibitors, InteRNA Technologies B.V. which is developing micro-RNA mimic therapies, Momotaro-Gene Inc. and Genprex, Inc., which are developing gene therapy approaches, and MiNA Therapeutics Limited, which is developing a small activating RNA therapy.
These technologies, along with other modalities, such as small molecules and biologics, may be used to develop therapeutic candidates that would compete against our current, and potentially future, product

candidates. In addition, we expect any OECs we develop to compete with established therapeutic treatments, if any, in their target indication.
Intellectual Property
We believe our intellectual property estate is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage. We strive to protect our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including pursuing, maintaining, defending, and asserting patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy and practice is to protect our proprietary position by various methods, including filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology (e.g., OMEGA platform, OECs, delivery and manufacturing technology), inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates. We continue to innovate and pursue in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of epigenetic medicine. We additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available and plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations for our therapeutic products. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 
Our wholly owned and in-licensed patent portfolio cover various aspects of the OMEGA platform, including, manufacturing, delivery, OECs and our therapeutic programs. Our patent portfolio also covers our product candidates that are in development. As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio consists of 28 patent families, including 40 pending U.S. patent applications (including provisional applications), 90 pending foreign patent applications in Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Japan, and nine owned or in-licensed Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications that have not entered national phase. Any US or foreign patents issuing from or claiming priority to the patent applications in our patent portfolio will expire between 2036 and 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees. Our objective is to continue to expand our patent portfolio to protect our proprietary technology (including the OMEGA platform, OECs, delivery and manufacturing technology), inventions, improvements and current and future product candidates. Our patent portfolio currently does not include any granted patent covering any of our product candidates.

Further details of the products and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below.

 We intend to continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy and file additional patent applications as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates.
 License Agreements
 We are a party to license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property from third parties. The licensed intellectual property covers, at least in part, methods and compositions for regulating gene expression by targeting IGDs. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We consider the following license agreements to be material to our business.
License Agreement with Flagship
In March 2019, we entered into an agreement, or the Flagship Agreement, with Flagship, pursuant to which we (i) irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to Flagship all of our right, title and interest in and to certain foundational intellectual property conceived prior to the "Launch of the Company", which is defined as the earlier of our closing of the Series B financing or the first day of employment by our CEO (such foundational intellectual property, the Foundational IP) and (ii) obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, transferable license from Flagship under such Foundational IP to develop, manufacture and commercialize any product or process or component thereof, the development, manufacturing and commercialization of which would infringe at least one valid claim of Foundational IP absent the license granted under the Flagship Agreement in the field of therapeutics during the term of the Flagship Agreement. In addition, Flagship irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to us all of its right, title and interest in and to any and all patents claiming any inventions conceived (i) solely by Flagship Pioneering, Inc., or Flagship Management, or jointly by Flagship Management and us, (ii) after the "Launch of the Company", and (iii) as a result of activities conducted pursuant to that certain managerial agreement with Flagship Management, or the Managerial Agreement, or other participation of Flagship Management in our affairs, but excluding Foundational IP. Foundational IP is directed, among other things, to the OMEGA platform, including to general methods and compositions (OECs) to modulate gene expression by targeting IGDs and specific compositions and methods directed to specific targets for the treatment of various disorders, such as MYC and CXCL1, 2, 3 & IL-8 related disorders. We utilize the rights granted by Flagship under the Flagship Agreement in our OMEGA platform and our therapeutic product candidates, including our therapeutic programs directed to MYC and CXCL1, 2, 3 & IL-8 programs. As of December 31, 2022, the Foundational IP was expected to expire between 2037 and 2042. The license granted to Foundational IP is contingent upon our compliance with our obligations under the Flagship Agreement. Our obligations under the Flagship Agreement include the use of commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and payments required under the Flagship Agreement, including royalties on net sales of the licensed products. Pursuant to the Flagship Agreement, we are obligated to pay Flagship, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, royalties in the low single-digit percentage on net sales of licensed products. We are solely responsible for the clinical development of any product candidates we develop based on the Foundational IP. Under the Flagship Agreement, Flagship retains the right to practice Foundational

IP within the field of therapeutics solely for non-commercial research and development purposes and to perform its duties under the Managerial Agreement.
The Flagship Agreement will terminate on the last to expire royalty term, which will expire, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, upon the expiration of the last valid claim of any Foundational IP covering such licensed product. Upon expiration of the royalty term with respect to a licensed product in any jurisdiction and payment in full of all amounts owed under the Flagship Agreement for such licensed product, the license granted to us will automatically convert into a non-exclusive, fully paid up license for such licensed product in such jurisdiction. We have the right to terminate the Flagship Agreement in its entirety for convenience upon 60 days of written notice. Either party may terminate the Flagship Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 30 days after receiving written notice. Also, Flagship may terminate (i) upon 30 days’ written notice if we cease to carry on our business with respect to the rights granted in the Flagship Agreement, (ii) upon written notice if we experience an event of bankruptcy, or (iii) immediately upon written notice if we challenge the validity, patentability, or enforceability of any Foundational IP or participate in any such challenge. If Flagship determines that we have not used commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product in a specific sub-field within the licensed field, Flagship has the right to terminate the license, on prior written notice, with respect to such licensed product in such sub-field. However, in such event, we may retain our license with respect to such licensed product and sub-field if Flagship approves a written plan for development and commercialization.
Exclusive and Co-Exclusive License Agreements with WIBR
In May 2019, we and WIBR entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the WIBR Exclusive Agreement. Under the WIBR Exclusive Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by WIBR to research, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease and import products and to perform and have performed licensed processes in the field of human and animal therapeutics and diagnostics. The licensed patents under the WIBR Exclusive Agreement are directed to, among other things, methods and compositions for modulating gene expression in IGDs.
In May 2019, we also entered into a co-exclusive license agreement with WIBR, or the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement. Under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement, we received a co-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by WIBR to research, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease and import products and to perform and have performed licensed processes in the field of human and animal therapeutics and diagnostics. Our co-exclusive rights under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement will become exclusive if the co-exclusive license agreement between WIBR and the co-exclusive licensee is terminated at any time for any reason. The licensed patents under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement are directed to, among other things, methods and compositions for modulating gene expression through targeting IGDs. The WIBR Exclusive Agreement and the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement are collectively referred to as the WIBR Agreements.
Under the WIBR Agreements, WIBR retains the right to practice the licensed patents for research, teaching, and other educational purposes, including use in third-party sponsored research, and to grant non-exclusive licenses to other academic and not-for-profit research institutes solely for non-commercial research, teaching, and other educational purposes.
The licenses granted to us under the WIBR Agreements are subject to certain preexisting rights held by the U.S. government. The U.S. government retains certain rights under applicable law with respect to licensed patents that arose from federal research funding. The license granted to us under the WIBR Agreements is further subject to certain preexisting rights held by a certain third party who is a party to a certain sponsored research agreement, or SRA, with WIBR. Under the SRA, WIBR covenanted not to sue said third party if certain inventions arising under the SRA, or SRA inventions, are dominated by the licensed patents and we are thereby excluded from asserting any patent rights licensed from WIBR that cover the SRA inventions against said third party. Furthermore, beginning five years after the effective date of the WIBR Exclusive Agreement, if WIBR or we receive a request from a third party for a sublicense under the licensed patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, or import a product or process that is not directly competitive with a licensed product or licensed process then offered for sale or in bona fide research or development by or on behalf of us, we must either (i) enter into a good faith negotiation toward granting a non-exclusive sublicense limited to the third party’s proposed

field and proposed product, or (ii) at our election, submit a plan for WIBR’s approval for development of the proposed product, which approval must not be unreasonably withheld.
Under the WIBR Exclusive Agreement, we are required to pay WIBR an annual license maintenance fee in the mid five figures. WIBR is also entitled to receive potential clinical and regulatory milestones up to $1.7 million in the aggregate for each of the first three licensed products (excluding backup products). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately $0.1 million of expenses, consisting of license maintenance fees, reimbursable patent costs and milestone payment, under the WIBR Exclusive Agreement. With respect to the sale of licensed products by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, WIBR is entitled to receive a low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products until, on a country-by-country basis, the expiration or abandonment of the patent rights. We are entitled to certain customary reductions and offsets on these royalties with respect to a licensed product in a given country. If we sublicense our rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product under the WIBR Exclusive Agreement, WIBR is entitled to a percentage of non-royalty payments that we receive from our sublicenses, ranging from zero to the low double-digits, depending on the stage of development our licensed products at the time such sublicense is executed.
Unless earlier terminated, the WIBR Exclusive Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all licensed patent rights. We may terminate the WIBR Exclusive Agreement at our convenience following written notice to WIBR. Either party may terminate the WIBR Exclusive Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party. WIBR may also terminate the WIBR Exclusive Agreement in the event that Omega ceases to carry on its business. The last to expire patent under the WIBR Exclusive Agreement, if issued, is expected to expire in 2038.
Under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement, we are required to pay WIBR an annual license maintenance fee in the low to mid five figures. WIBR is also entitled to receive potential clinical, regulatory, and sublicensing milestones up to $1.9 million in the aggregate for each of the first three licensed products (excluding backup products). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred less than $0.1 million of expenses, consisting of license maintenance fees and reimbursable patent costs, under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement. With respect to the sale of licensed products by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, WIBR is entitled to receive sub single digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products and low single digit percentage royalties on licensed services income until, on a country-by-country basis, the expiration or abandonment of the patent rights. We are entitled to certain customary reductions and offsets on these royalties with respect to a licensed product in a given country. If we sublicense our rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement, WIBR is entitled to a mid-five figure yearly payment for each such sublicense agreement that grants a sublicensee the right under the licensed patents.
Unless earlier terminated, the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all licensed patent rights. We may terminate the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement at our convenience following written notice to WIBR. Either party may terminate the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party. WIBR may also terminate the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement in the event that we cease to carry on our business. The last to expire patent under the WIBR Co-Exclusive Agreement, if issued, is expected to expire in 2037.
Agreements with Acuitas
Development and Option Agreement
In October 2020, we and Acuitas entered into a development and option agreement, or the Acuitas Option Agreement. Under the Acuitas Option Agreement, the parties agreed to jointly develop certain products combining our gene modulating therapeutics with Acuitas’s LNPs. Each party granted the other party a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under its proprietary technology to conduct the joint research. We will pay Acuitas’s personnel costs and external expenses incurred in performing research in accordance with a work plan under the Acuitas Option Agreement. Under the Acuitas Option Agreement, Acuitas granted us options to obtain non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable licenses under Acuitas’s patent rights and know-how related to LNP technology, or Acuitas LNP Technology, with respect to two specified targets (e.g., OEC constructs), or Reserved Targets, to develop and commercialize one or more therapeutic products including mRNAs that encode the Reserved Targets. For each option and Reserved Target, we are obligated to pay an annual technology access fee and target reservation and maintenance fees collectively in the low-mid six figures until such Reserved

Targets is removed from the Reserved Target list or until we exercise an option with respect to such Reserved Target. On exercise of the first option, we are required to pay a $1.5 million option exercise fee after execution of the first non-exclusive license. On exercise of the second option, we are required to pay a $1.75 million option exercise fee after execution of the second non-exclusive license. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred total expenses of $1.9 million under the Acuitas Option Agreement, consisting of technology access fees, target reservation and maintenance fees, the costs of services performed by Acuitas, the material costs and the reimbursable costs.
 Unless earlier terminated, the Acuitas Option Agreement will remain in effect until the first to occur of (1) both options being exercised, and (2) three years from the effective date, except that we can choose to extend the three year term for an additional two years. Either party may terminate the Acuitas Option Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or a similar event. We may terminate the Acuitas Option Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Acuitas. The last to expire patent under the Acuitas Option Agreement, if issued, is expected to expire in 2041.
License Agreement
In March 2021, we exercised the first option under the Acuitas Option Agreement and entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Acuitas, or the Acuitas License Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Acuitas License Agreement, we incurred an expense of $1.5 million for the option exercise fee. Acuitas granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under the Acuitas LNP Technology to research, develop, manufacture, and commercially exploit products consisting of our OTX-2002 gene modulating therapeutics and Acuitas’s LNPs. The last to expire patent under the Acuitas License Agreement, if issued, is expected to expire in 2041. Under the Acuitas License Agreement, we are required to pay Acuitas an annual license maintenance fee in the high six figures until we achieve a particular development milestone. Acuitas is entitled to receive potential clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments of up to $18.0 million in the aggregate. With respect to the sale of each licensed product by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, Acuitas is entitled to receive low single digit percentage royalties on net sales of the licensed product in a given country until the last to occur, in such country, of (i) the expiration or abandonment of all licensed patent rights covering the licensed product, (ii) expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product, or (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product, or Royalty Term. We are entitled to certain royalty reductions and offsets with respect to each licensed product in a given country if no licensed patents cover the licensed product or if we are required to obtain rights to third party patents that relate to LNP technology.
Unless earlier terminated, the Acuitas License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term. Either party may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party upon the other party’s bankruptcy or a similar event. We may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Acuitas.
Collaboration and License Agreement with Nitto
 In October 2022, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Nitto Agreement”) with Nitto, pursuant to which, among other things, Nitto granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, fully transferable and fully sublicensable license under all intellectual property (the “Nitto Licensed IP”) owned or controlled by Nitto relating to its LNP delivery technology.
 Under the terms of the Nitto Agreement, we paid Nitto an upfront cash payment of $1.0 million. We are also required to make up to $84.0 million in future payments to Nitto based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones. We are also obligated to pay to Nitto tiered, single-digit percentage royalties on a country-by-country basis based on net sales of the Licensed Product, subject to reduction in specified circumstances.
 Unless earlier terminated, the Nitto Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis when there are no further royalty payments owed by us to Nitto in such country with respect to the licensed product. Upon expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to the licensed product in a country, the license will become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable with respect to the licensed product in such country. The Nitto Agreement may be terminated by either party upon the other party’s uncured material breach of the Nitto Agreement, by either party in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences,

by us at any time after June 13, 2023 for any or no reason, and by us on a country-by country basis or in its entirety until June 13, 2023 for certain specified good faith reasons.
 Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation. We expect our product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical laboratory tests, and preclinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 
 Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
In addition to the IND submission process, sponsors of certain human clinical trials of cells containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including human gene transfer studies, are subject to evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and

oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution, pursuant to the National Institutes of Health’s Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to the public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval process
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from the filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug or biologic was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United

States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs and original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug or biologic that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug or biologic qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug or biologic is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical

evidence indicates that the drug or biologic has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Product candidates granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of clinical trial sites, including through expansion of trials to additional sites.
Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Post-approval requirements
Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements up. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in,

among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or “biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
Government regulation outside of the United States
Our product candidates will be subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by jurisdictions outside of the United States, and, in particular, the European Union, or EU, which may include, for instance, clinical trials, marketing authorization, post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.


Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
 Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
 While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the Clinical Trials Directive, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of the Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials (including those which are ongoing) will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
 Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorization
 In order to market our future product candidates in the EU, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an

investigational chemical or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:
•“Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of product candidates, such as (i) medicinal product derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) designated orphan medicinal product, (iii) ATMPs such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and (iv) medicinal product containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for product candidates containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for product candidates that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 •The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a MAA is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs.
 •“National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 Under the above described procedures, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clockstops. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates

these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Moreover, in the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions. Once the pending studies are provided, it can become a “standard” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved to medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
 Under the above described procedures, in order to grant the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Data and marketing exclusivity.
In the EU, new product candidates authorized for marketing, or reference product candidates, generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon MA. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical/biological entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
Pediatric development
In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal product candidates not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial

data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-month supplementary protection certificate extension or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of orphan market exclusivity is granted.
Orphan Medicinal Products
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically-debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, an application for designation as an orphan product must be submitted before the MAA. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and access to the centralized procedure. Upon grant of a MA, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means during this period, the regulatory authorities cannot accept another MAA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend a MA, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for which it received orphan drug destination, including where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold or it is judged that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Granting of an authorization for another similar orphan medicinal product can happen at any time if: (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior, (ii) the applicant cannot supply sufficient quantities of the orphan medicinal product or (iii) where the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the orphan register.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 The United Kingdom, or UK, left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period

provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.
EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”. However, new legislation such as the EU CTR will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
 As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain, or GB; broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a guidance on how various aspects of the UK regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, importing, exporting, and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development, or commercialization of medicines in the UK. The new guidance was given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, or the Exit Regulations.
The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore after Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAs. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore after Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAs. In order to obtain a UK MA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be established in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to obtain a MA to commercialize products in the UK. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new (centralized procedure) MA when determining an application for a GB authorization; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in GB.
There is no pre-MA orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA reviews applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB, rather than the EU, must not be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period or market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB.
 Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other health care providers. Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or

restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of noncompliance, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for medical products, drugs and services. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have also continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. For example, the ACA:
•increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; 
 •required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health care, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could impact the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services.
Data Privacy & Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. As our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain non-U.S. laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Cybersecurity
In the normal course of business, we may collect and store personal information and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, information regarding trial participants in connection with clinical trials, sensitive third-party information and employee information. To protect this information, our existing cybersecurity policies require continuous monitoring and detection programs, network security precautions, encryption of critical data, and in-depth security assessment of vendors. We maintain various protections designed to safeguard against cyberattacks, including firewalls and virus detection software. We have established and regularly test our disaster recovery plan and we protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, plan to perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. In addition, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.
 Our cybersecurity program is led by a team composed of a highly-skilled third-party security consulting firm and company employees. The program incorporates industry-standard frameworks (such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework), policies and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information. Our IT team reports to the Audit Committee annually on information security and cybersecurity matters, or as needed.
Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.
