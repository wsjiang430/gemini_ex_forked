ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company that discovers and commercializes novel, oral, small-molecule medicines. We focus on oral treatments for rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and an enzyme plays the key role in the biological pathway of the disease. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. We use X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity. Molecules from our discovery efforts that are commercially available or that are in active development are summarized in the table below and are discussed in further detail under “Products and Product Candidates” in this “Part I—Item 1—Business” section of this report.

*See “Business—Collaborations and In-License Relationships” for a description of our relationships with the third parties identified in this column.
In addition to the molecules referenced in the table above, we are pursuing oral medicines directed at other targets across the classical, lectin and terminal pathways of the complement system, including C2, a critical upstream serine 
protease enzyme for activation of the classical and lectin pathways. See “Business—Products and Product Candidates—Complement-Mediated Diseases” below for additional details.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is twofold: to serve patients and to create stockholder value both by focusing our discovery and development efforts on oral drugs for rare diseases for which a significant unmet medical need exists and by efficiently commercializing these drugs in the United States and certain other regions upon regulatory approval. By focusing on rare disease markets, we believe that we can more effectively control the costs of, and our strategic allocation of financial resources toward, post-approval commercialization.
We select disease targets and product candidates in which a small molecule would offer a significant benefit over existing products or would be the first to market. We strive to advance our product candidate portfolio from discovery to commercial markets efficiently by utilizing a small group of talented and highly-skilled employees working in conjunction with strategic outsource partners. We are unique in our approach to treat orphan diseases with orally-administered, small molecules, identified by utilizing crystallography and structure-guided drug design. The principal elements of our strategy are:
•Focusing on High Value-Added Structure-Guided Drug Design Technologies. We utilize structure-guided drug design in order to most efficiently develop new therapeutic candidates. Structure-guided drug design is a process by which we design a product candidate through detailed structural analysis of the enzyme target, which the product candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe that structure-guided drug design is a powerful tool for the efficient development of small-molecule product candidates that have the potential to be safe and effective. Our structure-guided drug design technologies typically allow us to design and synthesize multiple product candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target, with the goal of establishing broad intellectual property protection and formulating compounds with competitive advantages.
•Selecting Inhibitors that are Promising Product Candidates. We start by selecting disease targets with well-understood biology and characteristics that fit with our ability to utilize structure-guided drug design capabilities to build potent and specific enzyme inhibitors. Next, we narrow our selection of these product candidates based on product characteristics, such as initial indications of safety and biologic activity on the target.
•Developing our Product Candidates Efficiently. An important element of our business strategy is to progress our product candidates efficiently through the development process. In order to accomplish this, we typically strive for disease targets with a defined clinical and regulatory pathway for approval or diseases where high unmet needs allow for frequent interactions with regulators. In addition, as we determine such relationships to be appropriate or desirable, we control certain fixed costs and overhead by outsourcing with strategic partners and contractors or entering into license agreements with third parties. By outsourcing certain aspects of our operations, we are able to control overhead costs and focus financial resources directly where they provide the most benefit and reduce our business risk.
•Commercializing our Product Candidates Globally. A core part of our strategy is to commercialize our rare disease products globally. We have established commercial teams in the United States and other global markets for the commercialization of ORLADEYO, and we are continuing to build the structure and expertise to commercialize our products in additional markets where we believe we can do this efficiently and effectively. We have also established relationships with licensing, distribution and other partners in certain markets, including Japan, the pan-Latin America region, and parts of Europe and Asia, and will continue to seek such relationships where we determine this to be an effective approach.
Products and Product Candidates
ORLADEYO (Berotralstat)
ORLADEYO is an oral, once-daily therapy discovered and developed by us for the prevention of hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) attacks. HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition with a prevalence of between 1 in 33,000 to 1 in 67,000 people. HAE symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, 
including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. In addition, patients often have bouts of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, ORLADEYO suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients.
ORLADEYO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2020 for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Our specialty pharmacy provider for ORLADEYO in the United States began shipping ORLADEYO to patients with a prescription in the United States in December 2020. Through EMPOWER Patient Services, administered by our specialty pharmacy provider, we aim to streamline access to therapy by providing each HAE patient and their healthcare provider with a single point of contact for access to ORLADEYO. A dedicated care coordinator supports access for each patient with comprehensive financial support tools and reimbursement support.
In 2021, we announced that ORLADEYO received approvals in the European Union, Japan, the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) and the United Kingdom. Under our agreement with Torii, our collaborative partner commercializing ORLADEYO in Japan, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20% to 40% of net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships” below for a description of our relationship with Torii.
On January 10, 2022, we announced that ORLADEYO is now covered by all major payors and national and regional pharmacy benefit managers in the United States.
On February 24, 2022, we announced new long-term efficacy and safety data from the APeX-2 clinical trial evaluating ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE showing sustained reductions in attack rates and improvement in quality of life among patients living with HAE, regardless of their baseline attack rates and initial responses to ORLADEYO.
On June 6, 2022, we announced that Health Canada approved ORLADEYO for the routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in Canada.
On June 7, 2022, we announced that Swissmedic granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO for the routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in Switzerland.
On June 9, 2022, we announced that the Company entered into an exclusive collaboration with Pint Pharma GmbH (“Pint Pharma”) to register and promote ORLADEYO in the pan-Latin America region. Under the terms of the agreement, Pint Pharma will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all marketing authorizations and for commercializing ORLADEYO in the region.
On July 1, 2022, we announced new long-term efficacy and safety data from the APeX-2 and APeX-S clinical trials evaluating ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE showing sustained reductions in attack rates and improvement in quality of life among patients living with HAE, as well as improved management of symptoms after switching to ORLADEYO from an injectable long-term prophylactic treatment.
On August 4, 2022, we announced that pricing for ORLADEYO was finalized in Germany, France, and Switzerland in the second quarter of 2022.
On August 18, 2022, we announced that the Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved ORLADEYO to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in Saudi Arabia.
On November 10, 2022, we announced new real-world data demonstrating rapid, sustained reduction of patient-reported HAE attacks and consistently low attack rates among patients 12 years and older who started on ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE, including patients who switched from other prophylactic therapies.
On November 28, 2022, we announced that the Israeli Ministry of Health granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in Israel.
On January 23, 2023, we announced that the Company entered into a collaboration with Swixx BioPharma AG (“Swixx”) to commercialize ORLADEYO in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”). Under the terms of the agreement, Swixx will be responsible for commercializing ORLADEYO in 15 markets within CEE.
On January 26, 2023, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the pivotal APeX-P trial evaluating ORLADEYO in pediatric HAE patients who are 2 to <12 years of age.
On February 21, 2023, we announced that the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health Canadian Drug Expert Committee has recently issued a final draft positive recommendation for ORLADEYO to be reimbursed for the routine prevention of HAE attacks in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.
On each of December 7, 2020 and November 19, 2021, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust (“RPI”), pursuant to which we sold to RPI the right to receive certain royalty payments from the Company (the “RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements”). On November 19, 2021, we also entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “OMERS Royalty Purchase Agreement” and, collectively with the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements, the “Royalty Purchase Agreements”) with OCM IP Healthcare Holdings Limited, an affiliate of OMERS Capital Markets (“OMERS”), pursuant to which we sold to OMERS the right to receive certain royalty payments from the Company. The transactions contemplated under the Royalty Purchase Agreements are referred to herein as the “Royalty Sales.” See “Note 8—Royalty Monetizations—ORLADEYO and Factor D Inhibitors” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our obligations under the Royalty Purchase Agreements.
We have built out our U.S. commercial infrastructure to support the launch and continued commercialization of ORLADEYO in the United States and are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support launches in other markets. Based on proprietary analyses of HAE prevalence and market research studies with HAE patients, physicians, and payors in the United States and Europe, and two full years of commercialization experience with ORLADEYO in the United States in 2021 and 2022, we anticipate the global commercial market for ORLADEYO has the potential to reach a global peak of $1 billion in annual net ORLADEYO revenues. We expect at least 70 to 80 percent of our revenue at peak to come from the United States. These expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different. There can be no assurance that our commercialization methods and strategies will succeed, or that the market for ORLADEYO will develop in line with our current expectations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization—There can be no assurance that our or our partners’ commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of these risks.
Complement-Mediated Diseases
The goal of our overall complement program is to advance several compounds across multiple pathways in the complement system to treat many complement-mediated diseases. The complement system is part of the body’s natural immune system and is responsible for helping the body eliminate microbes (including viral and bacterial infections) and damaged cells. It is comprised of proteins that are primarily produced in the liver and circulate in the blood. Once activated, the complement system stimulates inflammation, phagocytosis and cell lysis. Excessive or uncontrolled activation of the complement system can cause severe, and potentially fatal, immune and inflammatory disorders. The complement system comprises biological cascades of amplifying enzyme cleavages involving more than 30 proteins and protein fragments, and may be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway (initiated by antibody-antigen complexes), the lectin pathway (initiated by lectin binding) and the alternative pathway (initiated by microbial surfaces). The alternative pathway also provides a critical amplification loop for all three pathways, regardless of the initiating mechanism. Factor D is an essential enzyme in the alternative pathway, thus making Factor D an attractive target to address complement-mediated diseases. Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by dysregulation of the complement system.
BCX9930
BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent, and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D, discovered by us for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. On December 15, 2022, we announced that, based on new competitive data recently presented at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, we no longer believe that BCX9930 would be commercially competitive, and we are discontinuing the development of BCX9930. This decision allows us to focus our complement inhibitor development efforts fully on BCX10013, a potential once-daily, oral Factor D (alternative pathway) 
inhibitor currently in clinical development and pursue additional oral compounds for multiple targets across other complement pathways.
BCX10013
On November 1, 2022, we announced that we have begun a clinical program with BCX10013, a novel, potent, and specific Factor D inhibitor. On January 9, 2023, we announced that initial data from ongoing phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose trials in healthy volunteers showed rapid, sustained and >97 percent suppression of the alternative pathway of the complement system 24 hours following a single 110 mg dose, and that BCX10013 has been safe and generally well-tolerated at all doses studied to date. On February 21, 2023, we announced that recent dose-related observations in an ongoing BCX10013 nonclinical study will delay the clinical program.
Under the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements, RPI will be entitled to receive tiered, sales-based royalties on net product sales, if any, of BCX10013, as well as tiered, profit share amounts of up to 3.0% from certain other permitted sales in certain markets. See “Note 8—Royalty Monetizations—ORLADEYO and Factor D Inhibitors” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our obligations under the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements.
Additional Complement Targets
On November 1, 2022, we announced that, in addition to BCX10013, which targets the alternative pathway of complement, we are pursuing oral medicines directed at other targets across the classical, lectin and terminal pathways of the complement system, including C2, a critical upstream serine protease enzyme for activation of the classical and lectin pathways. We have developed potent, selective molecules targeting C2, which are currently in lead optimization. 
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (“FOP”)
FOP is an ultra-rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 2 million people worldwide. It is a severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification. There is no cure for this condition, and there are no approved treatments for FOP in the United States.
On November 1, 2022, we announced that we believe that patients with FOP are likely to benefit from other oral ALK-2 inhibitors that currently are substantially ahead of our ALK-2 inhibitor, BCX9250, in development. Considering the expectation that patients will be well-served by these other products, and the approximately $100 million in additional investment that would be required to advance BCX9250 to approval, we are stopping the BCX9250 program and redirecting this investment to the other opportunities we have to serve patients with complement-mediated diseases.
Peramivir Injection (RAPIVAB, RAPIACTA, PERAMIFLU)
RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) was developed under a $234.8 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). In January 2010, our partner, Shionogi, received the first approval for peramivir injection and launched it in Japan under the commercial name RAPIACTA. It is approved in Japan for the treatment of adults, children, and infants with uncomplicated seasonal influenza and those patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. In August 2010, our partner, Green Cross, received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food & Drug Administration under the commercial name PERAMIFLU to treat patients with influenza A & B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships” below for a discussion of these licensing arrangements.
Peramivir was also approved in the United States in 2014, Taiwan in 2016, Canada in 2017, and Australia in 2018. A Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) was approved in the United States in February 2021, extending RAPIVAB’s availability for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza to pediatric patients six months and older. Prior to this approval, peramivir had been indicated in the United States for pediatric patients two years and older. In the United States, peramivir is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients who have been symptomatic for no more than two days.
In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) awarded us a $34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency. We initially delivered 20,000 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract in 
2019 for a total price of approximately $13.9 million. We further delivered 20,000 and 9,980 doses of RAPIVAB in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and recorded revenue of $13.9 million and $6.9 million for the years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 49,980 RAPIVAB doses of the 50,000 RAPIVAB doses available under the contract, effectively completing the contract with HHS. 
Galidesivir (BCX4430)
Galidesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that has been shown to be active against more than 20 RNA viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Marburg, Yellow Fever, Ebola, and Zika viruses and from exposures to aerosolized Marburg virus, an experimental condition designed to mimic an exposure scenario that could result during a bioterrorist attack. Our galidesivir research program has been substantially funded with federal funds under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the HHS (“NIAID/HHS”) and BARDA/HHS. All of our government funding for galidesivir expired in 2022, and we have no plans to continue the galidesivir program without government funding. 
Collaborations and In-License Relationships
ORLADEYO
Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Torii”)
On November 5, 2019, we entered into a Commercialization and License Agreement with Torii (the “Torii Agreement”), granting Torii the exclusive right to commercialize ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks in Japan. Under the Torii Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable payment of $22.0 million. We received an additional milestone payment of $15.0 million in the second quarter of 2021 upon receipt from the Japanese National Health Insurance System (“NHI”) of a reimbursement price approval for ORLADEYO.
Under the Torii Agreement, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20% to 40% of annual net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. Torii’s royalty payment obligations are subject to customary reductions in certain circumstances, but may not be reduced by more than 50% of the amount that otherwise would have been payable to us in the applicable calendar quarter. Torii’s royalty payment obligations commenced upon the first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan and expire upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan, (ii) the expiration of our patents covering ORLADEYO, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for ORLADEYO in Japan. We are responsible for supplying Torii with its required amounts of ORLADEYO. The activities of the parties pursuant to the Torii Agreement are overseen by a joint steering committee, composed of an equal number of representatives from each party to coordinate the development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan.
Under the Torii Agreement, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation (“ROFN”) to commercialize ORLADEYO in Japan for the acute treatment of HAE attacks if we develop ORLADEYO for such indication and to commercialize any additional kallikrein inhibitor that we may develop in the future for use in HAE in Japan. Under both ROFNs, if the parties do not agree to terms with respect to a definitive amendment to the Torii Agreement or new agreement, as applicable, the terms of the amendment or agreement would be set by a third-party arbitrator.
Other Collaborations for ORLADEYO
We have entered into a number of collaborations with commercial partners to help support the global launch of ORLADEYO. In 2021, we entered into supply and distribution agreements with Neopharm Ltd. (“Neopharm”) and NewBridge Pharmaceuticals (“NewBridge”) to support commercialization efforts in Israel and the UAE, respectively. Under the terms of these agreements, Neopharm will have the exclusive rights to commercialize ORLADEYO in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and NewBridge will support commercialization efforts in the UAE, as well as the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iraq. On June 9, 2022, we announced that we have entered into an exclusive collaboration with Pint Pharma to register and promote ORLADEYO in the pan-Latin America region. Under the terms of the agreement, Pint Pharma will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all marketing authorizations and for commercializing ORLADEYO in the region. On January 23, 2023, we announced that we have entered into a collaboration with Swixx to commercialize ORLADEYO in CEE. Under the terms of the agreement, Swixx will be responsible for commercializing ORLADEYO in 15 markets within CEE.
Peramivir Injection (RAPIVAB, RAPIACTA, PERAMIFLU)
Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”)
In February 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Shionogi Agreement”), an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize peramivir in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. In October 2008, we and Shionogi amended the Shionogi Agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan. The Shionogi Agreement provided for an upfront payment in exchange for the rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan, development milestone payments (which have all been paid), commercial milestone payments, and royalty payments on product sales of peramivir, in accordance with the terms of the Shionogi Agreement.
Generally, all payments under the Shionogi Agreement are non-refundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi is responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the Shionogi Agreement is from February 28, 2007 until terminated. Either party may terminate the Shionogi Agreement in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of termination without cause. In the event of termination, all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate and shall revert back to us. We developed peramivir under a license from the University of Alabama Birmingham (“UAB”) and have paid sublicense payments to UAB on the upfront payments and will owe sublicense payments on any future event payments and/or royalties received by us from Shionogi.
Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable 
On March 9, 2011, we completed a $30.0 million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement. Pursuant to the transaction, JPR Royalty Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Royalty Sub”), issued $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured 14.0% Notes due 2020 (the “PhaRMA Notes”) in a private placement to institutional investors. The PhaRMA Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the “Indenture”), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. We received net proceeds of $22.7 million from this transaction.
Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are payable from, and are secured by the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, which were transferred by us to Royalty Sub in 2011. We remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes. Royalty Sub’s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. 
In September 2014, Royalty Sub was unable to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding payment date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014. This inability constituted an event of default under the terms of the Indenture. Accordingly, we classified the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest as current liabilities on our balance sheet since that time. The PhaRMA Notes matured on December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of $30.0 million, together with all accrued and unpaid interest of $20.6 million, was due in full. The failure by Royalty Sub to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, at the December 1, 2020 final maturity date, constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Risks Relating to Contractual Arrangements—Because continuing events of default exist under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub. As a result, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments, if any, that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we could otherwise be adversely affected” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes. 
As of December 31, 2022, the PhaRMA Notes remained in default. We wrote off the balance due under the PhaRMA Notes to other income as a debt extinguishment as of December 31, 2021. See “Note 8—Royalty Monetizations—RAPIACTA—Non-Recourse Notes Payable—Debt Extinguishment” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the write-off.
Green Cross Corporation (“Green Cross”)
In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea and we are entitled to share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, all rights, data, materials, products, and other information would be transferred to us.
Additional Collaborations
We have previously entered into contracts with the U.S. Government, including the procurement contract with HHS for up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency and contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS for the development of galidesivir, as more fully discussed above under “Products and Product Candidates” and in “Note 15—Collaborative and Other Relationships” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 49,980 RAPIVAB doses of the 50,000 RAPIVAB doses available under the procurement contract, effectively completing the contract with HHS, and all of our government funding for galidesivir has expired.
We also have non-material license agreements with certain third parties, such as Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University (“AECOM”), Industrial Research, Ltd. (“IRL”), and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”), which require that we make certain payments related to development of the product candidates covered by these agreements, net sales on any resulting product made by us, and annual license fees. We licensed a series of potent inhibitors of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from AECOM and IRL, as well as an exclusive worldwide license of galidesivir for any antiviral use, and we have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors. There is currently no activity between us and UAB on these agreements, but when we license this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or royalties on amounts received.
Patents and Proprietary Information
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology, and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology, and products and product candidates.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates or those developed by our partners can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
As of December 31, 2022, we have been issued approximately 31 U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2039 and that relate to our kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, broad-spectrum antiviral (“BSAV”) compounds, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (“PNP”) inhibitor compounds, and complement-mediated disease 
program compounds. We have licensed a number of compounds protected by certain composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL, totaling three additional U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2029. Additionally, we have approximately 25 Patent Cooperation Treaty or U.S. patent applications pending related to kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds, PNP inhibitor compounds, FOP program compounds, and complement-mediated disease program compounds. Our pending applications may not result in issued patents, our patents may not cover the products of interest or may not be enforceable in all, or any, jurisdictions and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially viable. After expiration of composition of matter patents for our products and product candidates, we may rely on data exclusivity, or in some cases, method of use patents. The enforceability of these patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may not be allowed or enforceable in some territories where we may seek approval. We may not have the funds to continue patent prosecution or to defend all of our existing patents in our current patent estate and may selectively abandon patents or patent families worldwide or in certain territories.
Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of BioCryst and, where possible, require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive commercial and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, many have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials, and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations who conduct research in areas in which we are working. 
We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that successfully complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial marketing and sales of their products may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Our commercial potential could also be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Any of these competitive factors may impact our decisions with respect to our products, product candidates and early-stage discovery programs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Risks Relating to Competing in our Industry” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of these risks.
In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
HAE
HAE is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, unpredictable, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, or in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Prevalence for HAE is uncertain but is estimated to be approximately 1 case per 33,000 to 67,000 persons without known differences among ethnic groups and is caused by deficient (Type I) or dysfunctional (Type II) levels of C1-Inhibitor (“C1-INH”), a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in the blood. If left untreated, HAE can result in a mortality rate as high as 40% primarily due to upper airway obstruction. There are several licensed therapies for HAE, including the following:
•C1-INH replacement therapy is available as an acute therapy (Berinert®) and as a prophylactic therapy (Haegarda® and Cinryze®). These therapies are dosed subcutaneously and intravenously. Recombinant C1-INH (Ruconest®) is also available as an acute therapy.
•Kallikrein Inhibitors — Kalbitor® (ecallantide) is a specific recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor that is dosed subcutaneously by healthcare providers to treat acute HAE attacks. Takhzyro® (lanadelumab-flyo) is a monoclonal antibody approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks and can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection.
•Bradykinin receptor antagonist — Firazyr® (icatibant) and generic icatibant are indicated for the treatment of acute attacks and is administered by subcutaneous administration.
•Other medications — Prophylactic administration of synthetic attenuated androgens (generically available as danazol or stanozolol) has been utilized to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. However, long-term use of danazol or stanozolol may result in liver damage, virilization and arterial hypertension. Six-month liver function tests, annual lipid profiles, and biennial hepatic ultrasound are recommended for patients on chronic androgen therapy.
We are aware of a number of HAE therapies in clinical development that, if approved, may compete with ORLADEYO. These include:

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase | Role in Therapy

Complement-Mediated Diseases
Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by defects of the complement system, including, but not limited to, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (“aHUS”), complement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”), Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (“IgAN”), and myasthenia gravis. Alexion’s (part of AstraZeneca Rare Disease) Soliris® (eculizumab) is a C5 inhibitor approved for PNH, aHUS, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Soliris had global sales of over $3.7 billion in 2022. Alexion also received FDA approval for Ultomiris® (ravulizumab), a longer-acting C5 inhibitor, as a treatment for PNH in late 2018 and aHUS in late 2019. Global sales for Ultomiris were over $1.9 billion in 2022. Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Empaveli® is a C3 inhibitor approved for PNH in the United States and Europe in 2021.
We are aware of a number of complement pathway-based products in development, which include:

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase
Apellis | Empaveli | C3 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | Approved 
Akari | Nomacopan | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | III 
Roche | Crovalimab (RG6107) | C5 Inhibitor | IV / Subcutaneous | III

Ra / UCB | Zilucoplan | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | II 
Alnylam | Cemdisiran | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | II 

Amgen (Phase 3), Samsung, and Isu Abxis are also in clinical trials developing biosimilars of eculizumab.
Certain diseases that are mediated by defects of the complement system, such as IgAN, may also have pathology that is mediated by other mechanisms.  Products that are not inhibitors of the complement system, such as Tarpeyo (DR-budesonide) for IgAN, may change the treatment landscape and future competitive environment for our products.
Antivirals
The pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive. Key competitive factors for RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) include, among others, efficacy, ease of use, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, storage and handling requirements, and reimbursement. A number of products are currently available in the United States and/or other counties, including Japan, for the prevention or treatment of influenza, including seasonal flu vaccines, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.’s (“Roche”) TAMIFLU® (oseltamivir), generic oseltamivir, GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (“GSK”) RELENZA®, Genentech and Shiongi’s XOFLUZA® and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.’s INAVIR®. In addition, FUJIFILM Corporation’s favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, is approved in Japan.
Various government entities throughout the world are offering incentives, grants, and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against influenza, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors.
Research and Development
We initiated our research and development activities in 1986. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced research technologies, including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry, and pharmacology. Our research facilities, located in Birmingham, Alabama, include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and facilities to make product candidates on a small scale for early-stage clinical trials.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and foreign governments. These regulations include, among other things, regulations for the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred, and significant time may be devoted to clinical development. Further, the duration of the approval process may be exacerbated by global health concerns or other 
considerations that could prevent regulatory authorities from conducting their inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities that could significantly impact the ability of such authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions.
Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve a product candidate, the approval may limit the indicated uses for the product candidate, impose other restrictions on the product candidate, and/or may require post-approval studies that could impair the commercial viability of the product candidate. Even upon any approval to market our potential products, whether in the United States or internationally, we will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. These requirements are wide ranging and govern, among other things:
•adverse drug experience reporting regulations;
•product promotion;
•product manufacturing, including good manufacturing practice requirements; and product changes or modifications.
These government regulations are a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process may subject us to sanctions, including:
•delays;
•warning letters;
•fines;
•product recalls or seizures;
•injunctions;
•penalties;
•refusal of the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications;
•total or partial suspension of production;
•civil penalties;
•withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and
•criminal prosecutions.
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or approval of new indications for our existing products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
FDA Regulation
Before testing potential product candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an investigational new drug application (“IND”), including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. Thirty days after filing an IND, a phase 1 human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the trial.
Clinical trials to support a new drug application (“NDA”) are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.
Phase 1 — During phase 1, which involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy volunteers, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses.
Phase 2 — Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; (2) assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3 (pivotal) — If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies, or advanced clinical trials, are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at 
geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. In general, the FDA requires that at least two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials be conducted.
Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent upon many factors, including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take several weeks to several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at which patients enroll in a study depends on:
•willingness of investigators to participate in a study;
•ability of clinical sites to obtain approval from their IRB;
•the availability of the required number of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a given trial;
•the availability of existing or other experimental drugs for the disease we intend to treat;
•the willingness of patients to participate; and
•the patients meeting the eligibility criteria.
Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased expense and longer development timelines.
After successful completion of the required clinical testing, generally an NDA is submitted. Upon receipt of the NDA, the FDA will review the application for completeness. Within 60 days, the FDA will determine if the application is sufficiently complete to warrant full review and will consider the application “filed” at that time. Also upon receipt of the application, the FDA will assign a review priority to the application. Priority review applications are usually reviewed within 6 months; standard review applications are usually reviewed within 10 months. The FDA may refer NDAs for new molecular entities to an appropriate advisory committee for review and evaluation in regard to providing a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of an advisory committee.
Following the review of the application, which may include requests for additional information from the sponsor and results from inspections of manufacturing and clinical sites, the FDA will issue an “action letter” on the application. The action letter will either be an “approval letter,” in which case the product may be lawfully marketed in the United States, or a “complete response letter.” A complete response letter will state that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form and, usually, will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application. The complete response letter, when possible, will include the FDA’s recommended actions to place the application in a condition for approval. Deficiencies can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). A complete response letter may also be issued before the FDA conducts the required facility inspection and/or reviews labeling, leaving the possibility that additional deficiencies in the original NDA could be subsequently cited. An applicant receiving a complete response letter is permitted to resubmit the NDA addressing the identified deficiencies (in which case a new two- or six-month review cycle will begin), or withdraw the NDA. The FDA may consider a failure to take action within one year of a complete response letter to be a request to withdraw, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the NDA. If the FDA approves an NDA, the marketing of the product will be limited to the particular disease states and conditions of use that are described in the product label. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities.
Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For example, advertising and promotion are subject to stringent FDA rules and oversight, and as an NDA holder, we may be held responsible for any advertising and promotion that is not in compliance with the rules and regulations. In particular, the claims in all promotional materials and activities must be consistent with the FDA approvals for approved products and must be appropriately substantiated and fairly balanced with information on the safety risks and limitations of the products. We are also required to engage in appropriate truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning our products.
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing 
testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
We and all of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations during clinical development and to ensure that the product can be consistently manufactured to meet the specifications submitted in an NDA. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to product quality, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our products. Based on an inspection, the FDA determines whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities in non-United States countries that are utilized to manufacture drugs for distribution into the United States are also subject to inspection by the FDA. Additionally, failure to comply with local regulatory requirements could affect production and availability of product in relevant markets.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation, if sought, must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant with FDA orphan drug designation for a particular active ingredient to receive FDA approval of the designated drug for the disease indication for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period (“orphan drug exclusivity”) in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not finally approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the license holder cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition, provided that the sponsor has conducted appropriate clinical trials required for approval. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee for the orphan indication.
Fast Track Designation
Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of an IND may request the FDA to designate the drug candidate as a Fast Track drug if it is intended to treat a serious condition and fulfill an unmet medical need. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Once the FDA designates a drug as a Fast Track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication with, and guidance to, the sponsor.
In addition to other benefits, such as greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s review period as specified under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act for filing and reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA has been submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval, commercial sales, and distribution of drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, some of which are discussed below, and may also include post-approval commitments. 
European Union
The various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Pursuant to the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (the “Clinical Trials Directive”), a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the national competent authority of each EU member state in which a clinical trial is planned to be conducted. A clinical trial application (“CTA”) is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier and further supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and other applicable guidance documents, including, but not limited to, the clinical trial protocol. Further, a clinical trial may only be started after an independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the CTA in that country.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Regulation”), which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The Regulation came into effect on January 31, 2022 with a three-year transition period in which clinical trial sponsors will be able to choose among different submission pathways. The Regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU member states, aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
Manufacturing and import into the European Union of investigational medicinal products for use in clinical trials is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMP.
Under EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which then makes a recommendation to the European Commission (“EC”). The EC makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions, and the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states.
United Kingdom
The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the United Kingdom’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland (together, Great Britain or “GB”). Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority remains the MHRA. The MHRA published a draft guidance on how various aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiration of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development or commercialization of medicines in the United Kingdom. The U.K. regulatory regime largely mirrors that of the European Union.
Japan
Under the Japanese regulatory system administered by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. To obtain manufacturing/marketing approval, we must submit an application for approval to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) with results of nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy, and safety of a new drug. A data compliance review, good Clinical Practices on-site inspection, cGMP audit, and detailed data review are undertaken by the PMDA. The application is then discussed by the committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council (“PAFSC”). Based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by the MHLW. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the MHLW sets the prices of the products on this list. The price will be determined within 60 to 90 days following approval unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, 
however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The Japanese government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.
Fraud and Abuse and Related Regulatory Laws
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including both federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. Outside of the United States, we may be subject to analogous foreign laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations apply to our or our partners’ operations, sales and marketing practices, price reporting, and relationships with physicians and other customers and third-party payors. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
In addition, we are subject to the federal physician sunshine act and certain similar physician payment and drug pricing transparency legislation in various states. The sunshine provisions apply to manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government certain payments made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. 
Violations of the physician sunshine act and similar legislation or the fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and future exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.
Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
In both the United States and other countries, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products.
Adequate coverage and reimbursement in the United States and other countries is critical to the commercial success of approved products. Recently in the United States, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed, among other things, to reform government program reimbursement methodologies. In addition, individual states in the United States have been increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Many third-party payors negotiate the price of medical services and products and develop formularies that establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the third-party payor’s patient population. The process for obtaining coverage can be lengthy and costly, and it could take several months before a particular payor initially reviews a product and makes a decision with respect to coverage. For example, third-party payors may require cost-benefit analysis data in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of a particular product.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for drug products can have challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct an active comparator clinical trial to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates or products to other available therapies to support our pricing, which could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved healthcare products. Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, including reference price grouping, price freezes, increased price cuts, and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) made extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the United States. The PPACA included numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which became effective immediately and others of which have taken effect over the past several years. For example, the PPACA expanded healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The PPACA also imposed substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the United States, and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics. The PPACA also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally, including pharmaceuticals. It also required reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals.
The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose certain payments and transfers of value to, and investment interests held by, physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Compliance with the PPACA and state laws with similar provisions is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
In addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. For example, legislation has been enacted in certain states and at a federal level that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Compliance with these electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security, and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information (“PHI”), than the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA or that enter into a resolution agreement with the HHS to settle actual or potential allegations of HIPAA noncompliance may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations.
Many state laws govern the privacy of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from 
the CCPA, other personal information may be covered, and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope. Other states, such as Virginia, Colorado and Utah, have also enacted comprehensive privacy laws, and it is possible that additional states will follow suit.
EU member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations, and guidelines of the states in the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also imposes additional special protections for “special category data,” which includes health, biometric and genetic information of data subjects located in the EEA and, through incorporation in national legislation, the United Kingdom. Further, the GDPR provides a broad right for EU member states to create supplemental national laws, for example relating to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. The GDPR and similar national legislation grant individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allow them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provide the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR and similar national legislation impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other countries to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. These obligations and regulations also concern security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
The EU Clinical Trials Regulation also imposes new obligations to make publicly available certain information generated from clinical trials. Only very limited information is exempted from disclosure, i.e. commercially confidential information (which is construed increasingly narrowly) and protected personal data. It may be possible for others to use this data (for example, competitors who may use this data in their own research and development programs) once this data is in the public domain.
We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we undertake clinical trials. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the provision of our services, a number of which process personal data of EU individuals on our behalf. With each such provider we are required to enter into contractual arrangements under which they are contractually obligated to only process personal data according to our instructions, and conduct diligence to ensure that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place.
We are also subject to evolving European privacy laws on electronic marketing and cookies. The European Union is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation that will be directly implemented in the laws of each EU member state. While this e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018, it is still going through the European legislative process and the timing of its adoption remains unclear.
