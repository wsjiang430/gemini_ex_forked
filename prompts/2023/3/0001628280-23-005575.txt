Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others.
We are a founder-led, direct-to-consumer healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand that seeks to celebrate, empower and serve current and future generations of healthcare professionals. We are committed to helping this growing, global community of professionals, whom we refer to as Awesome Humans, look, feel and perform at their best—24/7, 365 days a year. We create technically advanced apparel and products that feature an unmatched combination of comfort, durability, function and style, all at an affordable price. In doing so, we have redefined what scrubs are—giving rise to our tag-line: why wear scrubs, when you can #wearFIGS?
We have revolutionized the large and fragmented healthcare apparel market. We branded a previously unbranded industry and de-commoditized a previously commoditized product—elevating scrubs and creating premium products for healthcare professionals. Most importantly, we built a community and lifestyle around a profession. As a result, we have become the industry’s category-defining healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand.
We sell products purposefully designed to serve the particular needs of healthcare professionals primarily through a convenient direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) digital platform, consisting of our website and mobile app. Our offerings include scrubwear and non-scrubwear, such as lab coats, underscrubs, outerwear, loungewear, compression socks, footwear and other lifestyle apparel. We primarily design all of our products in-house, leverage third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our product components and finished products, and generally utilize shallow initial buys and data-driven repurchasing decisions to test new products. We directly and actively coordinate and supervise every step of our product development and production process to ensure that our extremely high quality standards are met. We also have a dynamic merchandising model—due to the largely non-discretionary, replenishment-driven nature of scrubwear, we maintain lessened inventory risk driven by a relatively high volume of repeat purchases and a focus on our core scrubs offerings. 
We also use our digital platform to celebrate Awesome Humans in aspirational, creative and unexpected ways, and we leverage social media platforms to listen to, engage with, understand and better serve our community at scale. Our Ambassador Program consists of Awesome Humans from around the world who represent a diverse cross-section of the healthcare industry and help us interact with our community and drive engagement. Our differentiated approach to creating authentic and meaningful relationships with our community has allowed us to build a growing base of approximately 2.3 million active customers as of December 31, 2022 who are passionate about and loyal to our brand. 
In line with our purpose-driven mission, giving back is ingrained in everything we do at FIGS and has been from the beginning. When we started FIGS, we created an initiative called Threads for Threads to donate scrubs to healthcare professionals who work in resource-poor countries and lack the proper uniforms to do their jobs safely. To date, through Threads for Threads, we have donated hundreds of thousands of FIGS scrubs and other products to healthcare professionals in need around the world. We have also given in a variety of other ways, including through medical giving trips, tuition and student loan repayment grants, financial support to charitable organizations, and a wide range of other partnerships and giving initiatives that support our healthcare community and the communities that they serve every day. We also have developed an advocacy program designed to address some of the biggest challenges, including the need for equitable compensation, access to mental health services, workplace safety, reduced administrative burdens, and training, which are facing healthcare professionals today. In addition to our many other philanthropic efforts, advocacy at FIGS will continue to be an important way in which we support our community of Awesome Humans. 
Our Market Opportunity
Healthcare Apparel Is a Large, Growing and Largely Non-Discretionary Industry. 
The healthcare apparel market is a fundamentally attractive industry underpinned by its scale, recurring nature and compelling growth outlook. There are approximately 22 million healthcare professionals in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey. Furthermore, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of September 2022, employment in healthcare occupations in the United States is projected to grow 13% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 2 million new jobs. With an expanding aging 
population, proliferation of chronic illness, greater access to healthcare in the United States and an increasing focus on health and wellness, the demand for healthcare professionals continues to grow. 
In 2020, the total addressable market of the healthcare apparel industry was an estimated $12.0 billion in the United States alone and $79.0 billion globally, according to an April 2021 Frost & Sullivan study that we commissioned (the “Frost & Sullivan Study”). Unlike most other categories in the apparel sector, scrubwear, due to its frequent wear as a uniform, is largely non-discretionary, replenishment driven, recession resistant and much less susceptible to fashion or fad risk. Hospitals, medical offices, clinics and laboratories routinely require healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses and medical technicians to wear scrubs, lab coats and other medical apparel during every shift, and the vast majority of medical professionals purchase their own uniforms. Supported by these key trends, the healthcare apparel industry is expected to demonstrate strong and consistent growth, with the total addressable market in the United States expected to grow by a 6.1% CAGR between 2020 and 2025, from approximately $12.0 billion to approximately $16.0 billion, according to the Frost & Sullivan Study. 
The Industry Has Historically Lacked Innovation. 
Prior to FIGS, the healthcare apparel industry had operated for over 100 years with little change or innovation. Despite attractive market fundamentals, the industry had been held back, and its consumers underserved, by legacy participants with outdated business models. 
We believe that key limitations of industry incumbents include: (i) commoditized products that are notoriously ill-fitting, uncomfortable and lacking in design and functionality; (ii) limited non-scrubwear offerings; (iii) brand obscurity and limited brand loyalty resulting from sales under third-party licenses and lack of control over the product; (iv) antiquated distribution through a fragmented network of discount brick-and-mortar medical supply stores and lacking DTC distribution; (v) lack of a direct connection with the end customer; and (vi) structurally challenged margin profiles impacting incumbent manufacturers’ ability to invest in product innovation, marketing and customer experience.
The Industry is Fundamentally Changing. 
We believe the healthcare apparel sector is positioned for continued strong growth driven by several key industry dynamics. The healthcare apparel industry is growing and we believe has demonstrated resilience across economic cycles, driven by the largely non-discretionary, replenishment-driven nature of scrubwear and the secular growth of the healthcare sector. Consumers continue to embrace the convenience of online and mobile shopping. For healthcare professionals who work long shifts and all hours of the day and night, the convenience of eCommerce is even more necessary. Lastly, consumers are increasingly attracted to, and interested in engaging with, purpose-driven brands using social media channels. 
What Sets Us Apart
We believe that the following competitive strengths have been key drivers of our success to date and strategically position us for continued success. 
Deeply Passionate, Loyal Community 
By December 31, 2022, our deeply loyal community consisted of approximately 2.3 million active customers. Our brand awareness is driven largely by word of mouth among healthcare professionals who are passionate about FIGS, and whose passion quickly spreads through hospitals and healthcare institutions, where thousands of healthcare professionals often work in close proximity to one another. In addition, through our digital platform and social media presence, we provide venues for our community to engage with each other on common ground. We are proud that our products and digital platform are connecting healthcare professionals and bridging gaps that previously existed across varying disciplines and experience levels. 
Authentic, Category-Defining Brand 
FIGS is the first digitally native lifestyle brand outfitting healthcare professionals. Our brand represents high quality, functional, comfortable and stylish products combined with a seamless digital customer experience. We are purpose-driven with a mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others, and this purpose resonates with our community. We collaborate with other highly regarded brands to further extend our brand reach and enhance our appeal 
with customers. Through our Ambassador Program, we have formed meaningful relationships with hundreds of Awesome Humans who help us reach millions of healthcare professionals around the world in an intimate, authentic and personalized way. Our strong brand affinity is demonstrated by our high Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) of +79 through December 31, 2022.
Industry-Leading Product Innovation 
Our design philosophy is rooted in Technical Comfort™— the conviction that design, comfort and function are non-negotiable. As such, we deliver innovation across fabric, function, fit and style, all of which is led by comfort and performance. We strive to create the most innovative, functional, comfortable and stylish healthcare apparel in the industry designed to specifically address the needs of healthcare professionals—extraordinary people who deserve to look, feel and perform at their best. Our innovative products are designed, sourced and manufactured from the fiber level and our proprietary FIONx fabric technology is made from what we believe to be the best combination of materials, core-spun for maximum durability to withstand the demands of a healthcare professional’s work without sacrificing comfort. FIONx technical features include four-way stretch, anti-odor, anti-wrinkle, and moisture-wicking properties. Our scrubs also feature easy-to-access zippered pockets for professional and personal items such as stethoscopes, scissors, smartphones and ID badges. Our non-scrubwear, such as lab coats, underscrubs, outerwear, loungewear, compression socks and footwear, are also specifically designed for the needs and preferences of the healthcare community. 
Digitally Native Direct-to-Consumer Strategy 
Our business is powered by a digitally native DTC strategy, which offers significant competitive advantages and enables us to directly engage with and serve healthcare professionals. By owning all aspects of the customer experience, including website and app design, marketing content, storytelling and post-purchase customer engagement, we deliver an elevated, personalized and seamless experience. 
Our DTC strategy also gives us access to valuable real-time customer data. We leverage our rich customer data set, bolstered by the inherent benefits of our DTC model, to serve our community more effectively and efficiently. We develop proprietary and customized data solutions designed to optimize our product innovation, inventory analytics, marketing efforts and operational efficiency. Our data team works directly with key functional areas of the Company, including apparel design and merchandising, customer acquisition and retention, demand forecasting and inventory optimization. This approach enables us to gather and manage extensive data, and rapidly and directly apply that data to deliver valuable insights that improve our core operating activities and decision-making processes, leading to operational efficiencies throughout our supply chain, inventory management and new product development. Our vast and growing data set also plays a critical role in driving new customer acquisition as well as in our community engagement and customer retention strategy.
Dynamic Merchandising and Product Launch Model 
We have developed a dynamic merchandising strategy, anchored by our recurring, functional offering of 13 core scrubwear styles, which represented over 78% of our net revenues in 2022, and which we offer year-round in six core colors. To complement our scrubwear offering, we also offer non-scrubwear products, which together with our scrubwear, are intentionally designed to be worn as a Layering System from base layer to outer layer. We also launch limited edition colors, limited edition styles or new products almost every week, which not only drive excitement, but also drive our core business by encouraging recurring traffic to our digital platform. We utilize a disciplined buying approach for limited edition products, with generally shallow initial buys and data-driven repurchasing decisions to lower inventory risk, create scarcity and drive recurring demand. As an additional benefit, our product portfolio has resulted in a return rate of approximately 10% in 2021 and 2022, which is far lower than the broader online apparel return rates that tend to be in the 30% to 40% range.
Mission-Driven, Founder-Led Culture and Execution 
 Our co-founders, Heather Hasson and Trina Spear, who currently serve as our Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer, respectively, are the visionaries of our company. Each serves a unique role—Ms. Spear executes on the Company’s strategic vision and operations, and Ms. Hasson focuses on developing product innovation. Together, their shared mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others drives our company culture. We understand that authentically serving humans starts from within, and we are passionate about supporting our community and ensuring that our company reflects the world we want to live in. We are committed to operating responsibly and promoting ethical and 
sustainable business practices through our sourcing and manufacturing. We prioritize building a diverse, inclusive, equitable and supportive team that is driven by creativity and purposeful innovation. 
Our Products 
We approach product design with the healthcare professional in mind. We leverage customer data, customer feedback, focus groups and practitioner testing to provide us with an intimate understanding of how medical professionals move, work and interact with colleagues and patients. Our tight feedback loop through our digital platform and social media channels and our customer experience team enables us to quickly incorporate ideas from our community into our product design. We are constantly challenging ourselves to create the highest quality and most innovative fabrications, styles and product features that meet the unique needs of healthcare professionals. Our apparel is comfortable, durable, functional and stylish, all at an affordable price point. As a result of our efforts, healthcare professionals now have a destination to outfit themselves with products that allow them to look, feel and perform at their best. 
Healthcare professionals change environments frequently and need comfortable high-quality products that help them do their jobs in every situation they face. That’s why we approach our products as a complete layering system—the FIGS Layering System—which includes what healthcare professionals wear under their scrubs (such as underscrubs, sports bras and leggings), the scrubs themselves, and what they wear over their scrubs (such as vests, jackets and fleeces).
There are two primary categories within the FIGS Layering System: scrubwear and non-scrubwear:
•Scrubwear. We redefined scrubs, engineering them for function and taking cues from performance sports apparel, to create exceptionally comfortable and technical products to help healthcare professionals look good, feel good and perform at their best. Within the scrubwear category, we have 13 core styles that are available on our digital platform year-round. These core scrubwear styles consist of three women’s scrub tops, four women’s scrub pants, two men’s scrub tops and four men’s scrub pants. We offer these core styles in six core colors and in limited edition colors. Additionally, we frequently launch limited edition scrubwear styles in both core and limited edition colors.
•Non-Scrubwear. Our non-scrubwear products are intentionally designed as an integrated system that complements our scrubwear, and are comprised of “base layer” and “outer layer” products. Base layer products are those designed to be worn under scrubs and include compression socks and underscrubs. Our underscrubs include sports bras, performance leggings and tops and super-soft pima cotton tops. Outer layer products include footwear, lab coats, and a variety of vests and jackets. Our non-scrubwear product offerings also include our FIGSPRO offerings, which is our polished and performance-driven, office-ready collection. We also partner with New Balance to design and offer shoes that provide greater slip-resistance, cushion and moisture-repellent qualities that our healthcare professionals need. We also offer necessities such as face masks, scrub caps, lanyards, badge reels, tote bags, baseball caps and beanies.
Our Community of Awesome Humans
We strive to celebrate, empower and serve healthcare professionals across all levels of experience and areas of expertise. While there is considerable diversity in demographics and income levels within the healthcare sector, we attract a diverse range of healthcare professionals by having a differentiated brand and offering premium products at an affordable price point. 
Our customers include a wide range of experience levels and areas of expertise, including registered nurses, nurse practitioners, orthodontists, dental hygienists, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, veterinarians, sales representatives, estheticians, speech pathologists, emergency medical technicians, surgeons and healthcare administrators, among others. Due to the high proportion of our customer mix that is comprised of students and young professionals whose earnings will grow over the course of their careers, we believe we are well positioned to retain and increase engagement of these customers, expanding our share of their uniform and lifestyle wardrobe over time.
Our Marketing Strategy
We create differentiated brand marketing content and utilize performance marketing to drive customers from awareness to consideration to conversion. 
Brand Marketing 
We attract and retain customers in large part through our unique ability to engage with our community, which we do across multiple channels, including marketing campaigns, social media and our Ambassador Program. 
Marketing campaigns. Most of our creative assets are created in-house, allowing us to launch campaigns at an accelerated pace to celebrate the products we bring to market and the people who will wear them. We launch fully integrated marketing campaigns that feature Awesome Humans in larger-than-life scenarios, bringing the people, their profession and our brand to life. We also launch campaigns highlighting our product innovation and the story behind FIGS. Campaigns are launched through a holistic, multi-media strategy, where hero messaging and imagery are woven through every platform, including email, digital, display, site, direct-mail, commercials, social media and ambassadors. We believe our campaigns and inspiring messaging contribute to high brand affinity among our community. 
Social Media. We were the first healthcare apparel company to have a significant presence on social media. We use social media to foster a dialogue with our community and grow an enthusiastic, highly engaged fan base. Today, we have over 820,000 followers on Instagram, which is over twice the number of followers of our nearest competitor. We are proud of our robust following and above-average engagement rate. Social media is the primary place for our community to congregate, share stories, follow product launches and interact with our brand, and in turn, our community shares feedback that informs our product and content decisions. We strive to create content that has value and purpose—whether to amplify a cause, make people laugh, or to celebrate and educate about our product—and social media is where our creativity and deep connection to our community meet. 
Our Ambassador Program. FIGS is the first company to have brand ambassadors in the healthcare apparel industry, providing a platform for healthcare professionals to tell their stories. Our Ambassador Program consists of Awesome Humans from around the world, representing a diverse array of specialties and levels of experience across various professions and geographies. We have formed deep and meaningful relationships with our ambassadors and their loyalty, love and involvement with our brand fosters organic sharing, storytelling and intimate connections with the millions of healthcare professionals in our community. Our Ambassador Program is a microcosm of our FIGS community—they are invaluable to us, they inspire and inform everything we do, and we would not be where we are today without them. 
Performance Marketing 
Our performance marketing aims to offer the right products to the right healthcare professionals at the right times. Our sophisticated performance marketing efforts include retargeting, paid search and product listing advertisements, paid social media advertisements, search engine optimization, personalized email and mobile push notifications through our app. When combined with our community-driven brand marketing, our performance marketing supports attractive customer acquisition and retention metrics. Because we can pinpoint specifically who our customers are and where they live and work, we are able to target them with greater efficiency and less expense than other companies whose customers come from a much less defined group. 
Our TEAMS Business
We have built a differentiated B2B custom platform, known as TEAMS, to revolutionize, consumerize and elevate what had previously been an outdated buying process for institutional customers. Through TEAMS, healthcare administrators and institutions can seamlessly and efficiently solicit individual orders and buy FIGS products for their organizations. Our TEAMS business is centered around partnering with institutional departments and medical offices that wish to standardize and professionalize their organizations’ uniforms. 
Our Data Analytics
Data is an essential and embedded capability throughout our organization. Our data team works directly with key functional areas of the Company. This approach enables the harvesting and management of extensive data, the development of a suite of proprietary tools, and the direct and rapid application of those data and tools to improve core operating activities and decision-making processes throughout the Company. 
The scale of our data is vast and growing. Our rich data set is blended from first-party, deterministic and observed behaviors, a complementary, expanded set of enriched elements and hundreds of data attributes associated with millions of customers. In addition, we have established a unique approach to capturing granular data from all stages of the order 
journey. These data sets are used to build proprietary data science solutions applied to key functions across the company, including product development, supply chain, merchandising and inventory management, and marketing.
Our Technology
In addition to our use of data analytics, we internally develop custom, proprietary technology solutions where doing so would be a true differentiator and core to the unique needs of our community, and we otherwise leverage best-of-breed, third-party components and software to help build out our platform capabilities. Consistent with this philosophy, we created our own headless digital platform, which is a fully customized front-end architecture that allows our community of healthcare professionals to experience features and functionality that are specifically tailored to their needs. We then combine that customized presentation layer with the backend engine from Shopify, which is a proven and industry-leading e-commerce solution. We have also developed a customized iOS app to drive more meaningful engagement with our healthcare community. The features of our app extend beyond enhancing the purchase experience, enabling us to connect more deeply with our healthcare community through relevant, educational content, personalization and wellness support. By pairing our own in-house technology with cloud software, we have been able to create a truly differentiated user experience that we can adjust as necessary while also leveraging engineering talent from some of the best SAAS companies in the world to scale rapidly and efficiently. 
Our Supply Chain 
We have built a supply chain that is optimized for our business and through which we control the design, development and fulfillment of our products. 
Manufacturing
We have a diversified and flexible supply chain that leverages third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our product components and finished products. We directly and actively coordinate and supervise every step of our product development and production process. The extent to which we manage production is differentiated from the typical model of primarily relying on third-party agents to manage production. We believe our approach has enabled us to produce premium products through greater control of the end-to-end production process. 
Our in-house innovation and design team works closely with our suppliers to develop the materials for our products that meet our exact specifications for comfort, stretch, durability, functionality and performance. In 2022, approximately 85% of our production utilized our main scrubwear fabric technology FIONx, which enables us to achieve consistency and scale. Our in-house production team selects our fabric and trim suppliers, directly manages the relationships between these suppliers and our finished product manufacturers, and drives our production allocation strategy and production schedules. 
The 13 core scrubwear styles that we produce year-round represented over 78% of our net revenues in 2022. Similar to our core FIONx fabric, the continuous production of our core scrubwear styles provides us with consistency and scale in our production. We manage a diversified supply chain, which spanned 9 countries and consisted of approximately 34 global production partners as of December 31, 2022.
As a company devoted to the needs of healthcare professionals, quality is critically important to us. We have our own in-house quality control team and also independent third-party quality controllers that each conduct detailed quality control checks on our fabric, trims and finished products to ensure that our extremely high quality standards are met. We maintain stringent Acceptable Quality Limit standards, which define the level of quality required to pass our inspection processes. 
We purchase our finished product from our manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any supplier or manufacturer. We generally have long-standing relationships with our vendors, which are strengthened by the consistency and longevity of our core fabric and core style profile. We also source new suppliers and manufacturers to support our ongoing innovation and growth, particularly in our non-scrubwear categories.
Ethical Practices
We contractually commit all of our direct suppliers and manufacturers (“Tier I Suppliers”) to certain ethical requirements to help ensure they share our standards for quality of manufacturing, ethical working conditions and social and environmental sustainability practices. Our Tier I Suppliers are contractually required to adhere to the provisions of our Vendor Manual, through which they commit to providing working conditions that meet or exceed the labor standards established by the United Nations, local labor laws and the standards established by the Fair Labor Association. As part of our quality assurance procedures, FIGS team members visit all Tier I Suppliers on average two times each month, and they visit our Tier I Suppliers’ direct suppliers (“Tier II Suppliers”), to the extent nominated by FIGS, on average one time each month, to review their operations and our quality requirements. Further, pursuant to our Vendor Manual, our Tier I Suppliers are contractually required to hold Tier II Suppliers to substantially the same standards to which we hold our Tier I Suppliers, regardless of whether such Tier II suppliers are subject to our monthly reviews.
In line with our values, and in addition to having deep long-standing partnerships with our Tier I Suppliers, we also require all of our Tier I Suppliers to be certified through the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”) program, which is an organization focused on promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing. Through their commitment to adhere to our Vendor Manual, all of our Tier I Suppliers are contractually required to commit to upholding these standards. As part of our Tier I Suppliers’ required certification with WRAP, they commit to regular audits by WRAP directly to promote their compliance with WRAP’s 12 Principles, which are: (1) compliance with laws and workplace regulations, (2) prohibition of forced labor, (3) prohibition of child labor, (4) prohibition of harassment and abuse, (5) compensation and benefits, (6) hours of work, (7) prohibition of discrimination, (8) health and safety, (9) freedom of association and collective bargaining, (10) environment, (11) customs compliance and (12) security.
WRAP awards Gold certifications to facilities that demonstrate full compliance with WRAP’s 12 principles, and WRAP awards Platinum certifications to facilities that have demonstrated full compliance with WRAP’s 12 principles for three consecutive certification audits. Platinum facilities are required to successfully pass every WRAP audit with no corrective actions or observations and maintain continuous certification without gaps. All FIGS Tier I Suppliers must have a Gold or Platinum certification in order to continue to work with us, and we have a contractual right to terminate, without a cure period, our relationship with any Tier I Supplier who fails to meet our ethical standards.
Warehouse and Embroidery 
We distribute our products from our fulfillment center located in City of Industry, California, where we have created an innovative warehouse-within-a-warehouse model at our third-party logistics provider’s site. Within this space, we also operate a technology-enabled embroidery workshop, through which we offer text and logo embroidery on scrub tops, lab coats and outerwear, enabling our healthcare professionals to tell the world who they are and what they do. Our embroidery workshop is fully staffed by FIGS embroidery team members who complete the application and quality control of our embroidery product. We also rely on several additional third-party storage locations in Southern California to house inventory and we regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and capacity to ensure that we are able to meet our anticipated needs and support our continued growth. 
Our People and Human Capital
Our company culture mirrors our mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others. We understand that authentically serving humans starts from within, and we are passionate about supporting our community and enabling our company to reflect the world we want to live in.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 313 team members in the United States across our Santa Monica, California headquarters, our City of Industry, California fulfillment center location and remote locations. As of December 31, 2022, 93% of our employees were permanent employees. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce from time to time. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
As of December 31, 2022, our workforce predominantly remains in a hybrid work environment, and we have provided resources to enable employees to effectively manage remote work, such as web conferencing and project collaboration solutions and equipment and supplies for at-home offices. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees to continue to bolster functions across the Company, including design, innovation, engineering and functions related to our operations as a publicly traded company, as well as other functions, to support our expected growth. We pride ourselves on hiring team members who not only have 
the skills required to perform their respective roles, but also share in the mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We prioritize building a diverse, inclusive, equitable and empowered team representing a mix of gender, racial and ethnic backgrounds, industries, and levels of experience, and utilize dedicated technology from a leading third-party provider to drive inclusive hiring at every level. We also continuously assess our hiring process to identify areas for development and to improve our inclusive hiring strategies. We are deeply committed to creating a diverse and inclusive team through new sourcing methods, reducing unconscious bias across the recruitment life cycle and promoting fair and consistent hiring practices.
Our hiring methods currently include (1) utilizing special tools to review all communications to candidates to facilitate the use of inclusive language and (2) leveraging a bias scanner within our applicant tracking system to hide pictures or mask other elements that could introduce bias into the hiring process. We are also in the process of elevating our talent acquisition curriculum to include broader interview training on diversity and inclusion best practices. 
Based on data collected in January 2023, we are proud that:
•38% of our board of directors identified as women and 25% identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups;
•approximately 70% of our leadership team identified as women, 30% identified as men and 30% identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups; and
•approximately 66% of our total workforce identified as women, 31% identified as men, 1% identified as non-binary, 1% identified as agender and 58% identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups.
We are also proud that in 2022 approximately:
•60% of our employee applicants identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups; and
•52% of our newly hired employees identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups.
Compensation and Benefits
We aim to offer highly competitive compensation and benefits designed to enable us to attract, retain and motivate exceptional talent. Our 2021 equity incentive award plan additionally provides for grants of equity awards to employees. We are proud that we grant all new hires equity as part of their total compensation package, which we believe fosters a stronger sense of ownership and aligns our employees’ interests with the interests and growth of the Company. 
In addition to base compensation and awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plan, we offer numerous benefits, including a 401(k) plan with matching, health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, life insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, a referral bonus program and company-sponsored short term and long term disability. To drive further engagement and individual ownership of the Company, we also maintain an employee stock purchase plan, which provides eligible employees an opportunity to purchase additional FIGS stock at a discounted price. 
Culture and Perks
We believe that to be successful, each of our employees must feel empowered to show up as their true authentic selves. As we continue to grow, we are proactive in enabling every single person at FIGS to have a platform to be seen, heard and celebrated. To accomplish this goal, we are intensely focused on our culture, team-building initiatives and well-being. Our employee-led Culture Committee strives to foster an empowering, supportive and healthy experience for all FIGS employees and helps enable all FIGS voices to be represented and heard, by routinely organizing Company-wide events and initiatives focused on diversity and inclusion. Our Culture Committee programming also provides a way for our employees to give back to the community, driving connections and making an impact on a wide variety of organizations in need. 
Safety 
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. The core elements of our employee health and safety strategy are risk analysis, incident management and training, including for our team members at our fulfillment center, and we ensure that our third-party logistics provider, which operates our fulfillment center, maintains robust safety practices as well. We also maintain a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report health and safety risks, among other concerns. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also continued to implement safety protocols to protect our employees when working on-site, including protocols regarding social distancing and face coverings, temperature checks and testing.
Competition
Competition in the healthcare apparel industry is principally on the basis of product quality, innovation, style, price, brand image, distribution model, as well as customer experience and service. The healthcare apparel industry includes established companies as well as new entrants. We compete against wholesalers of healthcare apparel, such as Careismatic Brands, Barco Uniforms, Landau Uniforms and Superior Group of Companies. Additionally, we compete with healthcare apparel aggregated retailers, such as Scrubs & Beyond and Uniform Advantage, as well as DTC brands such as Jaanuu and Mandala. We also may face competition from large, diversified apparel brands with name recognition and well-established sales, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure that choose to expand into the production and marketing of healthcare apparel. One such brand, Fabletics, has recently done so.
We believe we have competitive advantages from our technical product innovation, our focus on empowering the community of healthcare professionals, and our high quality brand image. In addition, we believe our digitally native DTC distribution strategy differentiates us from the industry incumbents and allows us to establish personal customer relationships and more effectively support healthcare professionals. Furthermore, while we also compete against other DTC companies, we believe the greater relative scale of our business provides us with a competitive advantage. We are also differentiated by our commitment to community-based marketing that increases brand awareness and strengthens customer loyalty.
Government Regulation
In the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) regulations, product labeling regulations, product safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of fulfillment centers and privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation, (together “UK GDPR”), the ePrivacy Directive and national implementing and supplementing laws in the European Economic Area and relevant legislation in the UK. Our products sold outside of the United States may be subject to tariffs, treaties and various trade agreements, as well as laws affecting the importation of consumer goods.
We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. While compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of employees, as well as financial resources, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compliance with these laws and regulations, including any applicable environmental regulations, has not had, and in any material subsequent period is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
Intellectual Property
To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions in license agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contracts. Our intellectual property is an important component of our business, and we believe that our know-how and continuing innovation are important to developing and maintaining our competitive position. We also believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable on our products is an important factor in continuing to build our brand and distinguish our products. We consider the FIGS name and Cross & Shield Logo trademarks to be among our most valuable intellectual property assets. In addition, we have applied to register or have registered the trademarks for several of our fabrics and product names, and have also sought and/or obtained trademark registrations for several of our taglines.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 11 U.S. trademark registrations, had 18 pending U.S. trademark applications, owned 81 foreign trademark registrations and had 72 pending foreign trademark applications.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 12 granted U.S. design patents, eight pending U.S. design patent applications, 62 granted foreign design registrations and 28 pending foreign design applications, which relate to our core scrubwear and other apparel designs. The term of protection for design patents and design registrations is limited in duration and depends on the jurisdiction in which they are granted. The terms for our issued design patents in the U.S. extend 15 years from the date of patent grant. 
If the foreign design registrations issued to us for our core scrubwear and apparel are maintained until the end of their terms, they are expected to expire in the years ranging between 2030 and 2047, at which point we intend to renew them, to the extent they are renewable. Some of our issued U.S. design patents will expire in 2036, while others will expire in 2037. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
