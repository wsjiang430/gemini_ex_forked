ITEM 1. BUSINESS
iHeartMedia is the number one audio media company in the U.S. based on consumer reach.
Within the audio industry, companies operate in two primary sectors:
•The ‘music collection’ sector, which essentially replaced downloads and CDs and
•The ‘companionship’ sector, in which people regard radio and podcasting personalities as their trusted friends and companions on whom they rely to provide news on everything from entertainment, local news, storytelling, information about new music and artists, weather, traffic and more.
We operate in the second sector and use our large scale and national reach in broadcast radio to build additional complementary platforms. We believe we are the only major multi-platform audio media company, and each platform is complementary to the others, building on and extending our companionship relationship with the consumer.
Our product strategy is to be where our listeners are with the products and services they expect from us regardless of where they are and what platforms they're using. 
Our radio stations, podcasts and other content can be heard across a broad range of audio platforms, including our AM/FM broadcast radio stations; HD digital radio stations; satellite radio; on the Internet at iHeart.com, our radio stations’ websites, and certain Metaverse platforms; and through our iHeartRadio mobile application on 250+ platforms and thousands of devices, including enhanced automotive dashes, on tablets, wearables and smartphones, on gaming consoles, via in-home entertainment (including smart televisions) and voice-controlled smart speaker devices. All of this is supported by the largest audio sales force in the United States, executing on the strategy of any seller, anywhere being able to sell anything, supported by our unique technology.
We lead in:
•Broadcast radio: We have a strong relationship with our consumers, and our broadcast radio audience has the largest reach of any audio company in the U.S., with an audience that is over twice as large as that of the next largest commercial broadcast radio company, as measured by Nielsen.
•Digital: Our iHeartRadio digital platform is the number one streaming broadcast radio platform, with five times the digital listening hours of the next largest commercial broadcast radio company, as measured by our subsidiary Triton.
•Podcasts: We are the number one podcast publisher, and we are two times the size of the next largest commercial podcast publisher as measured by downloads, according to Podtrac. We are the podcast industry leader and have the largest volume growth across all podcast publishers in global downloads, which increased 56% year over year. 
•Ad Tech: We are the only company able to provide a complete ad tech solution for all forms of audio: on demand, broadcast radio, digital streaming radio and podcasting. For our advertising customers, the combination of these services creates a one-of-a-kind cross-platform advertising solution that spans all of audio with data targeting and attribution measurement solutions.
•Social media: Our personalities, stations and brands have a social footprint that includes 293 million fans and followers as measured by ListenFirst, which is twelve times the size of the next largest commercial broadcast audio media company. This social footprint was at the heart of delivering 28 billion social media impressions for our 2022 iHeartRadio Music Festival.
•Events: We have live and virtual events including eight major nationally-recognized tentpole events. These live and virtual events provide significant opportunities for consumer promotion, advertising and social amplification.
The unification of our many brands across these diverse product offerings under the "iHeartRadio" masterbrand has allowed us to build out new platforms as well as extend into third-party platforms like Snapchat, Roblox,YouTube and cable and broadcast television.
Our superior local, national, and online sales force combined with our leading digital, events, content, and representation business position us to cover a wide range of advertiser categories, including consumer services, retailers, 
entertainment, health and beauty products, telecommunications, automotive, media and political. Our contracts with our advertisers range from less than one-year to multi-year terms.
Our History
iHeartMedia, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2007 for the purpose of acquiring the business of iHeartCommunications, Inc., a Texas corporation (“iHeartCommunications”), which occurred on July 30, 2008. Prior to the consummation of our acquisition of iHeartCommunications, iHeartMedia, Inc. had not conducted any activities, other than activities incident to its formation in connection with the acquisition, and did not have any assets or liabilities, other than those related to the acquisition.
On March 14, 2018, we and certain of our subsidiaries filed the Chapter 11 Cases under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”). We emerged from Chapter 11 on May 1, 2019. Our Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on July 18, 2019.
We report our financial statements based on three reportable segments:
•Multiplatform Group, which includes the Company's Broadcast radio, Networks, Sponsorships and Events businesses;
•Digital Audio Group, which includes all of the Company's Digital businesses including podcasting, the iHeartRadio digital service, its digital advertising technology companies, its digital websites, newsletters and digital services and programs; and its audio industry-leading social media footprint; and
•Audio & Media Services Group, which provides other audio and media services, including the Company's media representation business, Katz Media Group (“Katz Media”), and RCS Sound Software ("RCS"), a provider of scheduling and broadcast software to the industry at large.
Multiplatform Group
The Multiplatform Group includes our Markets Group, which includes our 860+ broadcast radio stations in 160 markets; our Events business, which includes both live and virtual events; our SmartAudio suite of data targeting and attribution products; Premiere Networks, which includes the Premiere Networks syndication business and Total Traffic and Weather Network; BIN: Black Information Network and our National Sales Organization. The Multiplatform Group segment revenue was $2,597.2 million in 2022, $2,489.0 million in 2021 and $2,206.9 million in 2020.
According to Nielsen, for the full year of 2022, we have the most number one ranked station groups across the top 160 markets, and across the largest 50 markets, with 73 and 28 number one ranked station groups in these markets, respectively. With our broadcast radio platform alone, we have over twice the broadcast radio audience of our next closest broadcast competitor. We also have five times the digital listening hours of our next closest commercial radio broadcast competitor.
Our national scale and extensive local footprint allow us to offer marketing solutions at national, regional and local levels, or any combination thereof. Our local sales force services approximately 160 U.S. markets, including 48 of the top 50 markets, and 86 of the top 100 markets. Our advertisers cover a wide range of categories, including financial services, automotive, health care, telecommunications, insurance, education, food and beverage, entertainment and political. As a result of the diversification of our product offerings, as well our geography, no single advertising category makes up more than approximately 5% of our total advertising revenue. Our contracts with our advertisers range from less than one-year to multi-year terms.
Our Multiplatform Group segment has the following revenue streams:
Broadcast Radio: Our primary source of revenue is derived from selling advertising time on our domestic broadcast radio stations, generating revenue of $1,887.4 million in 2022, $1,812.3 million in 2021 and $1,604.9 million in 2020. Advertising rates are principally based on the length of the spot and how many people in a targeted audience listen to our stations, as measured by independent ratings services.
Increasingly, across both national and local markets, our advertisers are demanding data-rich, analytics-driven advertising solutions. iHeartMedia is the only audio media company that offers a comprehensive suite of tech-enabled advertising solutions, providing advanced attribution and analytics capabilities through our SmartAudio platform, which 
includes:
•Our digital-like ad-buying solution that allows clients to view the available broadcast inventory across various cohorts to address their specific needs; 
•Our application of data science to aggregate business data from broadcasts and the user insights that come from listeners using our digital platform; and 
•Our tools to present the effectiveness of clients' broadcast radio advertising campaigns by providing detailed digital dashboards on the results of the advertising spend.
These programmatic, data and analytic and attribution solutions account for an increasing proportion of ad buying and we expect that it will continue to expand in the future.
Radio Stations
As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated 864 radio stations, including 249 AM and 615 FM radio stations.  All of our radio stations are located in the United States. No one station is material to our overall operations. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations.
Radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). As described in “Regulation of Our iHeartMedia Business” below, the FCC grants us licenses in order to operate our radio stations.

Networks: We enable advertisers to engage with consumers through our Premiere Networks and Total Traffic & Weather services. We generate broadcast advertising revenue from selling advertising on our programs featuring top personalities, and also generate revenue through the syndication of our programming to other media companies. Premiere Networks and Total Traffic & Weather generated revenue of $503.2 million in 2022, $503.1 million in 2021 and $485.0 million in 2020.
•Premiere Networks is a national radio network that produces, distributes or represents approximately 120 syndicated radio programs and services for more than 6,400 radio station affiliates. Our broad distribution capabilities enable us to attract and retain top programming talent. Some of our more popular syndicated programs featured top talent including Ryan Seacrest, Sean Hannity, Bobby Bones, Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, Glenn Beck, Steve Harvey, Elvis Duran, Dan Patrick, Colin Cowherd, and the Breakfast Club. We believe recruiting and retaining top talent is an important 
component of the success of our radio networks.
•Total Traffic & Weather Network delivers real-time local traffic flow and incident information along with weather updates, sports and news to more than 2,000 radio stations and approximately 170 television affiliates, as well as through Internet and mobile partnerships, reaching over 200 million consumers each month. Total Traffic & Weather Network services more than 230 markets in the U.S. and Canada. It operates the largest broadcast traffic navigation network in North America.
Sponsorship & Events: We held live, in-person and virtual events, including eight major nationally-recognized tent pole events in 2022. Our eight major tentpole events include: the iHeartRadio Music Festival; the iHeartRadio Music Awards; iHeartRadio Wango Tango; the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour; the iHeartCountry Festival; iHeartRadio ALTer Ego; the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards and iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina. In 2022, our live and virtual local and national tentpole events, including endorsement and appearance fees generated by on-air talent, resulted in revenue of $189.0 million in 2022, $160.3 million in 2021 and $107.7 million in 2020 from sponsorship, endorsement and other advertising revenue, as well as ticket sales and licensing. 
Digital Audio Group
Our Digital Audio Group segment includes our fast-growing podcasting business - iHeartMedia is the number one podcast publisher in North America - as well as its industry-leading iHeartRadio digital service, available across more than 250 platforms and 2,000 devices; our digital sites, newsletters, digital services and programs; its audio technology companies and ad tech platforms, including Unified, Voxnest, Triton Digital, and Omny Studios; and its audio industry-leading social media footprint. Our Digital Audio segment revenue was $1,021.8 million in 2022, $834.5 million in 2021 and $474.4 million in 2020.
•Podcasting: Our multi-platform strategy, and the flywheel benefits it accrues, has enabled us to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing podcasting sector. iHeartMedia is the number one podcast publisher, as measured by Podtrac with 369 million global monthly downloads and streams and 30 million U.S. unique monthly users, in December 2022 and has the most shows featured in the Top 10 across all categories including Stuff You Should Know, The Breakfast Club, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, and many more. We also have the first podcast to pass 1 billion downloads with Stuff You Should Know. Podcasting generated revenue of $358.4 million in 2022, $252.6 million in 2021 and $101.7 million in 2020.
•Digital excluding Podcast: Our reach extends across more than 250 platforms and thousands of different connected devices. Our digital business is comprised of streaming, subscription, display advertisements, and other content that is disseminated over digital platforms, as well as social media, a capability enabled by the purchase of Unified. Our leading streaming product, iHeartRadio, is a free downloadable mobile app and web‑based service that allows users to listen to their favorite radio stations, as well as digital‑only stations, custom artist stations, and podcasts. Monetization on the free streaming application occurs through national and local advertising. We also have two subscription-based offerings, iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access. 
In April 2021, we acquired Triton Digital, the global technology and services leader to the digital audio and podcast industry, giving us the only unified ad tech stack for all forms of audio media. Digital excluding podcast generated revenue of $663.4 million in 2022, $581.9 million in 2021 and $372.7 million in 2020.
Audio & Media Services Group:
We also provide services to broadcast industry participants through our Katz Media and RCS businesses, which accounted for revenues of $304.3 million in 2022, $248.0 million in 2021 and $274.7 million in 2020.
•Katz Media is a leading media representation firm in the U.S. representing more than 3,400 non-iHeartMedia radio stations and over 780 television stations and their respective digital platforms. Katz Media generates revenue via commissions on media sold.
•RCS is a leading provider of cloud and on-premises broadcast software, media streaming and research services. Our software (radio and television automation, music scheduling, newsroom automation, advertising sales management, disaster recovery solutions) and real-time audio recognition technology is used by more than 10,000 radio and television stations, cable channels, record labels, advertisers and agencies worldwide.
Our Growth Strategy
Our strategy is centered on building strong consumer relationships across our multiple platforms with national reach. Providing this kind of at-scale companionship creates high-value advertising inventory and delivers superior returns to both. Moreover, we believe that we can leverage our investments in technology and data-informed decision making to better monetize our assets and to capture increasing market share across the broader advertising ecosystem. The key elements of this growth strategy are:
Continued capture of advertising spend from all mediums
We intend to take advantage of our national scale, the brand power of "iHeartRadio," and product innovation to capture additional share of the overall audio advertising pool. We also believe our enhanced audience data and related analytics tools should drive additional revenue from other advertising sectors, including digital and television, as advertisers are able to target audiences and measure the efficacy of their ad spend in a manner that mirrors the capabilities of these other mediums. We believe our advertising partners value the unique reach, engagement and return potential of audio, as well as iHeartMedia's differentiated platforms and marketing expertise, positioning the Company to capitalize on this trend. 
We have made, and continue to make, significant investments so we can provide an ad-buying experience similar to that which was once only available from digital-only companies. Our SmartAudio suite of data targeting and attribution products provides improved planning and automated ad-buying by relying on sophisticated planning algorithms and a cloud-based network across all of iHeartMedia's broadcast radio inventory to deliver highly optimized plans to our advertising customers. With SmartAudio, advertisers can do impression-based audience planning and dynamic radio advertising that utilizes real-time triggers such as weather, pollen counts, sports scores, mortgage rates and more to deploy different campaign messages based on what is happening in a specific market at a specific moment. SmartAudio has allowed brands to use broadcast radio advertisements to dynamically serve the most relevant message in each market, at each moment, just as they do with digital campaigns, to ensure increased relevance and impact. Further SmartAudio is the first fully digital measurement and attribution service for broadcast radio that we believe can transform the way advertisers plan, buy and measure much of their audio campaigns to better optimize the extensive reach of radio. We continue to look for ways to further develop our advertising capabilities in order to expand our share of advertising partners' budgets.
Increasing share of national advertising market
Broadcast radio is the number one consumer reach medium, and advertisers have a renewed appreciation for its scale, diverse demographic access and impact. We intend to complement our current local advertising presence in approximately 160 U.S. markets by further growing our stake in national advertising campaigns through our multi-platform portfolio of audio assets, roster of on-air talent, and the amplifying effect of our listeners' social engagement. As a result of our ongoing technology investments, national advertisers can now look to our audio offerings with their extensive reach, efficient pricing and digital-like analytics as powerful alternatives to other national ad mediums.
Broadening the scope of audio engagement
We continue to expand the spectrum of choices for our listeners-both in terms of compelling content and the array of ways in which it can be consumed. In the past few years we launched (i) BIN: Black Information Network, the first and only 24/7 national and local all news audio service dedicated to providing an objective, accurate and trusted source of continual news coverage with a Black voice and perspective; (ii) The Black Effect Podcast Network, a joint venture with Charlamagne Tha God developed to amplify Black voices, celebrate Black creators and invest in the Black community, with culturally relevant content across a variety of genres; (iii) My Cultura, a podcast venture dedicated to elevating Latinx voices and creators and to sharing the Latinx experience with millions of listeners; (iv) iHeartLand, a Metaverse experience that includes a variety of games and events; and (v) our broad range of sports programming. Our industry-leading audio sports assets include the largest sports podcast network in the industry, which has partnerships with the NFL and the NBA. We also have sports podcasts led by marquee talent like Colin Cowherd and Dan Patrick as well as the iHeart Sports Network, which reaches approximately 75 million Americans according to Nielsen, our sports talk and sports betting stations and our ongoing live coverage of professional teams on select stations across the country. 
In addition, the proliferation of connected TVs, voice assistants, smart auto and other connected devices greatly increases the range of options for accessing and interacting with our content, with significant increases to listenership across these devices in 2022. 
Notably, iHeartRadio, our all-in-one digital music, podcast and live streaming digital radio service, is available on an 
expansive range of platforms and devices including smart speakers, digital auto dashes, tablets, wearables, smartphones, virtual assistants, televisions and gaming consoles. We are also very focused on rapidly growing content categories, such as our leadership position in podcasting. These initiatives not only improve the listener experience, they facilitate further engagement and heightened frequency of advertising impressions.
We have continued to extend our leadership position in podcasting, and we are now the largest podcast publisher. We believe that podcasting is to talk what streaming is to music and is the next strategic audio platform. Our podcasting platform allows us to capture incremental revenue as well as extend station brands, personalities and events onto a new platform-ultimately extending and deepening our consumer relationships and our opportunities for additional advertising revenue.
Employing technology to gain greater penetration of the full spectrum of advertising clients and segments
In addition to having sellers in approximately 160 local markets across the U.S., which few media companies can claim, we intend to extend our technology platform to address the clients that we do not currently reach through direct sales operations. As an indication of the size of the potential opportunity, we currently have approximately 45,000 total clients compared to millions of clients for some of our largest social and search competitors that utilize technology solutions for advertisers of all sizes. We continue to enhance our monetization capabilities utilizing our industry leading Ad Tech stack, taking advantage of programmatic marketplaces, our capabilities to target cohorts, and our ability to dynamically insert advertising. In 2020, we acquired Unified Enterprises Corp., which provides customers with a complete advertising solution across all forms of digital media, including the information and intelligence data that they need to make informed decisions about their advertising investments. Additionally, in 2020, we acquired Voxnest, Inc., a podcast programmatic technology solutions business that allows for the consolidation of the fragmented podcast marketplace and the best-in-class provider of podcast analytics, enterprise publishing tools, programmatic integration and targeted ad serving. With this acquisition, we are able to provide podcast advertisers with additional targetable inventory at scale by allowing the effective and efficient monetization across an entire range of podcast inventory on this one-of-a-kind programmatic platform. In 2021, we acquired Triton Digital, a global leader in digital audio and podcast technology and measurement services and announced the Triton Audio Marketplace, an innovative global open audio exchange that allows customers to aggregate audiences at scale across broadcast, podcast, and streaming - a first of its kind offering. These acquisitions, coupled with our leading broadcast footprint, establish us as the only company able to provide a complete set of advertising technology and measurement solutions for all forms of audio: on-demand, broadcast radio, digital streaming radio, and podcasting. 
Utilizing our unique bundle of advertising inventory to drive uplift
While Broadcast Radio Cost Per Mille ("CPMs" or the cost of every 1,000 advertisement impressions) have historically been lower compared to other forms of advertising, we believe that our expanding portfolio of advertising products and services, including high-value digital products, may result in a CPM uplift for us. Although our primary focus is revenue, we also aim to maximize the value of our inventory. Moreover, we are continuing to develop platforms (including podcasts) that independently garner superior CPMs.
Leveraging the iHeartRadio master brand to expand our high-profile events platform
Audio is a social experience and an important extension of the medium is events. For our listeners, events are an opportunity to interact with fellow fans and engage with their favorite artists. For our advertising partners, they are a chance to reach a captivated and highly targeted audience directly tied to our high reach and strong engagement broadcast radio platform. They also provide an opportunity to extend into platforms like streaming cable and broadcast television, create ancillary licensing revenue streams, and generate ticket revenue. This is especially true with respect to our expansion into virtual events, which are live streamed over various networks and platforms. As with all of our platforms, the data collection from these sources is valuable to both our product creation process and our advertisers. Through our portfolio of major award shows, festivals and local live events and virtual events, we intend to continue to find innovative ways to integrate sponsorships and deliver unique advertising moments. In doing so, we will seek to create additional revenue opportunities through this platform.
Competition
We compete for share of our listeners’ time and engagement, a challenging task in today’s fragmented and multi-tasking world. We believe our national reach, the strength of our brand and assets, the quality of our programming and personalities, and the companionship nature of our medium allows us to compete effectively against both our legacy competition-cable and broadcast television, and other broadcast radio operators-as well as newer, digital competition, including streaming music and video services, social media, and other digital companies.
Similarly, we compete for advertising and marketing dollars in the U.S. advertising market against an increasingly diverse set of competitors. Our legacy competition for the radio, podcast and digital advertising market includes legacy broadcast radio operators, as well as satellite radio companies, podcasters and streaming music companies with ad supported components of their business. We also compete in the larger U.S. advertising market-inclusive of the radio, podcast and digital opportunity-by developing and offering competitive advertising products intended to attract advertising and marketing dollars that might otherwise go to companies in the cable and broadcast television, digital, search, Internet, audio, print, newspaper, sponsorship and other advertising spaces.
Intellectual Property
Our success is dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technology and the know‑how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights and operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our investments made into the development of our technology by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know‑how, confidentiality agreements and procedures, non‑disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we own approximately 261 issued U.S. patents, 65 pending U.S. patent applications, 16 issued foreign patents and 20 pending foreign patent applications, in addition to 398 U.S. trademarks registrations, 35 U.S. trademark applications, 704 state trademark registrations, 30 state trademark applications, 514 foreign registered trademarks and 55 foreign trademark applications. The duration of our intellectual property rights vary from country to country, but our U.S. patents expire 20 years from the patent filing date.
We have filed and acquired dozens of issued patents and active patent applications in the U.S. and we continue to pursue additional patent protection where appropriate and cost effective. We intend to hold these patents as part of our strategy to protect and defend the Company’s technology, including to protect and defend the Company in patent‑related litigation. Our registered trademarks in the U.S. include our primary mark “iHeartRadio” and various versions of the iHeart word marks and logos. We have a portfolio of internet domain names, including our primary domains www.iheart.com and www.iheartmedia.com. We also have licenses with various rights holders to stream sound recordings and the musical compositions embodied therein, as further described under “-Regulation of our Business-Content, Licenses and Royalties” below.
We believe that our intellectual property has significant value and is important to our brand‑building efforts and the marketing of our products and services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights. In addition to the forms of intellectual property listed above, we own rights to proprietary processes and trade secrets, including those underlying the iHeartRadio digital platform. While we use contractual and technological means to control the use and distribution of our proprietary software, trade secrets, and other confidential information, both internally and externally, including by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, and partners and maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
Human Capital Management
Of the many strengths that iHeartMedia possesses, none is more valuable than our people. Our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. To attract and retain talent, we seek to provide a work environment that creates a diverse, inclusive and supportive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers and provides meaningful work, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.
Workforce Composition
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 employees. These employees represent the diverse and complex nature of iHeartMedia with skills in programming operations, sales, engineering, podcasting, digital and beyond, as well as corporate support, such as information technology, legal, human resources, communications and finance. Our workforce is comprised of approximately 85% full time and 15% part time employees. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and/or union-represented bargaining units, none of which represent a significant number of employees, with approximately 8% of our workforce subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe we maintain positive relationships with our union and non-union employees. 
Total Rewards
We strive to create an environment that prioritizes the development and well-being of our employees. Our culture emphasizes collaboration, creativity, innovation, and respect - values that provide a foundation for success both inside and outside the workplace. We operate in a highly competitive environment and make significant investments in our people and strive to provide competitive pay and comprehensive benefits* including: 
•Employer sponsored health insurance, including 100% Company-paid programs for assistance in managing ongoing or chronic health conditions;
•Company provided life insurance;
•Paid sick and vacation days;
•Paid parental leave for both primary and secondary caregivers;
•Mental health care and resources;
•Paid holidays, including spirit days so that our employees may volunteer in their community;
•401(k) plan and Company-matching contribution; 
•An upgraded Employee Assistance Program, which is available to employees and their household members at no cost and provides services such as in person and telephonic counseling sessions, consultation on legal and financial matters and referrals for services such as child-care and relocation; and
•Various voluntary benefits including hospital indemnity, accident insurance, identity theft, pet health and legal insurance.
*Benefits eligibility varies depending on full-time and/or union status
Talent Development & Training
We are committed to supporting and developing our employees through global learning and development programs. We invest in a variety of employee training and compliance programs that give our employees the tools and information they need to make better decisions, to become better leaders and managers, to become better communicators and to work more collaboratively as a team. iHeartMedia employees engage in a variety of extensive training throughout the year and in 2022 our employees completed over 71,000 hours of training.
Diversity
Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") are key to our success. Our DE&I efforts are led by our Chief Diversity Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and our President. In addition, our Board is committed to seeking director candidates who can best contribute to the future success of the Company and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment and leveraging of the group’s diversity of skills and experience, resulting in board members with diverse backgrounds, including, among other attributes, gender, ethnicity and professional experience.
As a company, we value diversity and respect all voices, from both inside and outside our Company. Our Company reaches 90% of all Americans every month, so listening to, understanding and integrating input from diverse voices and views is critical to our success. One of our top priorities at iHeartMedia is to create an inclusive organizational culture to attract and develop a dynamic workforce that is as diverse as the audiences and communities we serve, which includes and supports gender identity, race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic background, age, disability, national origin and more. We have continued to make important progress against that goal this past year and making investments across the Company, including forming key partnerships internally and externally, engaging in research and discussion, and closely collaborating with our leadership team to ensure implementation across the Company. This holistic approach is centered on creating real change with a sense of urgency and commitment based on the following priorities:
•Leadership Commitment – We continue to develop leaders through DE&I education to drive and coach inclusive management throughout their divisions while evolving our processes and procedures to support leadership accountability in delivering their divisions' DE&I goals.
•Workplace Culture – Using the foundation of our recently implemented career progression framework, we provide comprehensive learning and development opportunities for all employees, consistent performance management and skills development for career growth.
•Workforce Diversity – We continue to expand recruitment outreach to colleges and underrepresented communities in addition to year-round internship programs across multiple teams with the intention to hire our interns upon graduation. By leveraging our career framework, we are evolving our hiring and promotion practices to be based on 
skills, evaluations and data. We are also improving our onboarding experience to support employee success, inclusion, and retention. 
•DE&I Sustainability – We continue to support infrastructure and integrated processes for a long-term systemic approach to drive and enhance a DE&I culture and seek to establish a strategic and systemic approach to our DE&I strategy for long-term sustainability and to enhance organizational effectiveness. 
Workplace Safety
Employee health and safety in the workplace is of the utmost importance to our Company. We believe that all employees, regardless of job role or title, have a shared responsibility in the promotion of health and safety in the workplace. We are collectively committed to providing and following all safety laws and rules, including internal policies and procedures. This means carrying out company activities in ways that preserve and promote a clean, safe and healthy environment. 
Seasonality
For information regarding the seasonality of our business, please refer to Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulation of our Business
General
Radio broadcasting is subject to extensive regulation, including by the FCC under the Communications Act. The Communications Act permits the operation of a radio broadcast station only under a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Among other things, the Communications Act empowers the FCC to: issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcast licenses; assign frequency bands for broadcasting; determine stations’ technical parameters; impose penalties and sanctions for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures and, in extreme cases, license revocation; impose annual regulatory and application processing fees; and adopt and implement regulations and policies affecting the ownership, program content, employment practices and many other aspects of broadcast station operations.
This following summary does not comprehensively cover all current and proposed statutes, regulations and policies affecting our business. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules, public notices and rulings and other relevant statutes, regulations, policies and proceedings for further information concerning the nature and extent of regulation of our business. 
Transfer or Assignment of Licenses
The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of an FCC licensee without prior FCC approval. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the existing licensee and the proposed licensee, including compliance with FCC’ rules and the “character” of the proposed licensees. Applications for license assignments or transfers involving a substantial change in ownership are subject to a 30‑day period for public comment, during which parties may petition to deny such applications.
License Renewal
The FCC grants broadcast licenses for a term of up to eight years. The FCC will renew a license for an additional eight‑year term if, after consideration of the renewal application and any objections thereto, it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and that, with respect to the station seeking renewal, there have been no serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and pattern of abuse of the Communications Act or FCC rules. The FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than eight years, although renewal for less than the full eight‑year term is rare. While we cannot guarantee the unconditional grant of any future renewal application, our stations’ licenses historically have been renewed for the full eight‑year term.
Ownership Regulation
FCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as “attributable” interests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) 
officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and indirect parent(s); (2) general partners and limited liability company managers; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly “insulated” from management and operational activities; (4) a 5 percent or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a corporate licensee or parent (except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, a 20 percent voting threshold applies); and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33 percent of a licensee’s total asset value, if certain other conditions are met (the “EDP Rule”). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15 percent of the broadcast time under a local marketing agreement (“LMA”), or sells more than 15 percent per week of the advertising time under a joint sales agreement (“JSA”), on a radio station in the same market is also generally deemed to have an attributable interest in that station.
Debt instruments, non‑voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited partnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule. To the best of our knowledge at present, none of our officers, directors or 5 percent or greater stockholders holds an interest in another broadcast station that is inconsistent with the FCC’s ownership rules.
The FCC's local radio ownership rule is the only FCC media ownership rule that is currently relevant to our business. Under that rule, the maximum allowable number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the number of stations in the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio service (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50 percent of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour‑overlap methodology where they do not exist.
The Communications Act requires the FCC to periodically review its media ownership rules, and those reviews have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and follow-on regulatory proceedings. In November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a decision that resulted in reinstatement of rules restricting cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast radio (or television) stations, and of broadcast radio and television stations, which the FCC had previously eliminated. The Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Third Circuit's decision in April 2021, and the cross-ownership rules are therefore not currently in effect.
In December 2018, the FCC commenced its 2018 quadrennial review of its media ownership regulations. In June 2021, following the Supreme Court decision described above, the FCC sought comment to refresh the record in its 2018 quadrennial review, and that review remains pending. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule including whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. In addition, on December 22, 2022, the FCC commenced the 2022 Quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership rules with initial comments due March 3, 2023, again seeking comment on the local radio ownership rule. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC’s media ownership proceedings or their effects on our business in the future.
Irrespective of the FCC’s media ownership rules, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) have the authority to determine that a particular transaction presents antitrust concerns. See “Item 1. Business – Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations.”
Alien Ownership Restrictions
The Communications Act and FCC regulations prohibit foreign entities or individuals from indirectly (i.e., through a parent company) owning or voting more than 25 percent of the equity in a corporation controlling the licensee of a radio broadcast station, unless the FCC determines that greater indirect foreign ownership is in the public interest. The FCC generally will not make such a determination absent favorable executive branch review. 
  To the extent that our aggregate foreign ownership or voting percentages exceeds 25 percent, any foreign holder or “group” of holders, defined pursuant to FCC regulations, of our common stock whose ownership or voting percentage would exceed 5 percent or 10 percent (with the applicable percentage determined pursuant to FCC rules) must also obtain the FCC’s specific approval. 
Programming and Content Regulation
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” A licensee must present programming that responds to issues in the station’s community of license and maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness. Federal law also regulates the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. The FCC has authority to impose fines exceeding $400,000 per utterance with a cap exceeding $4 million for a continuing violation. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on appeals of several FCC indecency actions, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC’s indecency policies. The FCC has since solicited public comment on those policies in a proceeding which remains pending. In addition, the FCC regulates the conduct of on-air station contests, requiring in general that the material rules and terms of the contest be broadcast periodically or posted online and that the contest be conducted substantially as announced. The FCC also regulates, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identification, the use of emergency alert system tones and the advertisement of contests and lotteries.
Equal Employment Opportunity
The FCC’s rules require broadcasters to engage in broad equal employment opportunity recruitment efforts, retain data concerning such efforts and report much of this data to the FCC and to the public via periodic reports filed with the FCC or placed in stations’ public files and websites. The FCC periodically audits for compliance with its equal employment opportunity rules and broadcasters can be sanctioned for noncompliance.
Technical Rules
Numerous FCC rules govern the technical operating parameters of radio stations, including permissible operating frequency, power and antenna height and interference protections between stations. Changes to these rules could negatively affect the operation of our stations.
Content, Licenses and Royalties
We must pay license fees to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers) for the rights to broadcast and stream musical compositions. Copyright owners of musical compositions most often rely on intermediaries known as performing rights organizations (“PROs”) to negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect license fees under such licenses and distribute them to copyright owners. We maintain public performance licenses from, and pay license fees to, various PROs including the four major PROs in the U.S., which are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), SESAC LLC ("SESAC") and Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”). These licenses periodically come up for renewal, and as a result certain of our PRO licenses are currently the subject of renewal negotiations pertaining to periods that commenced effective January 1, 2022 and continuing thereafter. The outcome of these renewal negotiations could impact, and potentially increase, our music license fees. In addition, there is no guarantee that additional PROs will not emerge, which could impact, and in some circumstances increase, our royalty rates and negotiation costs.
To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, we also must obtain performance rights licenses and pay public performance royalties to copyright owners of sound recordings (typically, performing artists and record companies). Under Federal statutory licenses, we are permitted to stream any lawfully released sound recordings and to make ephemeral reproductions of these recordings on our computer servers without having to separately negotiate and obtain direct licenses with each individual copyright owner as long as we operate in compliance with the rules of those statutory licenses and pay the applicable royalty rates to SoundExchange, the organization designated by the Copyright Royalty Board (“CRB”) to collect and distribute royalties under these statutory licenses. For music streams that do not qualify for statutory licenses, we must license performance rights directly from sound recording companies. From time to time, SoundExchange notifies us that certain calendar years are subject to routine audits of our royalty payments. The results of such audits could result in higher royalty payments for the subject years. 
The rates at which we pay royalties to sound recording copyright owners are privately negotiated or set pursuant to a regulatory process. In addition, we have business arrangements directly with some copyright owners to receive deliveries of and, in some cases, to directly license their sound recordings for use in our Internet operations. There is no guarantee that the licenses and associated royalty rates that currently are available to us will be available to us in the future. In addition, Congress may consider and adopt legislation that would require us to pay royalties to sound recording copyright owners for broadcasting those recordings on our terrestrial radio stations. 
The CRB has issued a final determination establishing the royalty rates payable to SoundExchange for the public 
performance and reproduction of sound recordings by various non‑interactive webcasters, including radio broadcasters that simulcast their terrestrial programming online, to apply to the period January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2025 under the so‑called webcasting statutory license. The applicable rates set by the CRB are subject to an annual upward CPI-U adjustment under the terms of the CRB’s final determination, and therefore future increases in the costs of goods and services in the United States will likely have the corresponding effect of increasing certain of our music licensing costs. Furthermore, the CRB’s final determination of these webcasting statutory license royalties is currently the subject of pending appeals from various parties. The outcome of that appeal process could impact, and potentially increase, our royalty rates, and increased royalty rates resulting from that appeal process could significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our business. Additionally, there are conditions applicable to the webcasting statutory license. Some, but not all, record companies have agreed to waive or provide limited relief from certain of these conditions under certain circumstances for set periods of time. Some of these conditions may be inconsistent with customary radio broadcasting practices. 
Potential Changes
Congress, the FCC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies may in the future adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, profitability and ownership of our broadcast stations and Internet‑based audio music services. In addition to the regulations, proceedings and procedures noted above, such matters may include, for example: proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; changes to the political broadcasting rules, including the adoption of proposals to provide free air time to candidates; restrictions on the advertising of certain products, such as beer and wine; spectrum reallocations and changes in technical rules; and the adoption of significant new programming and operational requirements designed to increase local community‑responsive programming and enhance public interest reporting requirements. 
Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations
Beyond compliance with FCC rules governing media ownership, our acquisition of additional radio stations or other businesses could receive scrutiny or challenge under the federal antitrust laws. Transactions that meet specified size thresholds are subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the Hart‑Scott‑Rodino Act (the “HSR Act”) by the DOJ or the FTC Whether or not an acquisition is required to be reported under the HSR Act, the antitrust authorities may investigate the transaction and may take such action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or requiring divestiture of the acquired assets or certain of our other assets. Any future iHeart acquisition could be the subject of review and/or remedial action by antitrust authorities, particularly if it involves businesses or markets in which we already hold a significant market share.
Privacy and Data Protection
Privacy and data protection legislation and regulation play a significant role in our business. We obtain information from users of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our websites, web pages, interactive features, digital survey panels, applications, social media pages, and mobile application (“Platforms”), in accordance with the privacy policies and terms of use posted on the applicable Platform. We collect personal information automatically from a Platform users' device, as well as directly from Platform users in several ways, including when a user uses or purchases our products or services, registers to use our services, fills out a listener profile, posts comments, uses our social networking features, participates in polls and contests and signs up to receive email newsletters. We also may obtain information about our listeners from other listeners and third parties. We use and share this information for a variety of business purposes including for analytics, attribution and to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to Internet users based on their geographic locations, the type of device they are using, their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activity. In addition, we obtain audience behavior information from third-party data providers who represent to us that they are compliant with applicable laws. Outside our consumer-facing businesses, we collect personal information from and about our employees and our business partners.
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy. While many of these laws and regulations are still evolving, they have impacted, and will continue to impact our business by restricting our collection, use, retention, sharing and other processing of data, including both personal information and technical information related to users and devices, which also reduces our ability to effectively deliver relevant ads to our users, and by increasing compliance cost and risks. 
In the area of information security and data protection, various laws and regulations in the United States and most countries require companies to implement measures and controls to protect certain types of information and to notify users and other third parties if there is a security breach. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant 
liabilities. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") empowers the California Attorney General to impose non-compliance penalties of up to $7,500 per violation for certain types of violations and provides a private right of action and minimum statutory damages for certain types of data breaches, with possible damage awards of $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater. The EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") provides potential fines up to EUR 20 million or 4% of worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater for certain types of non-compliance. The CCPA establishes data privacy rights for consumers residing in the State of California, imposes special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, creates notice obligations and new limits on the "sale" of personal information and creates a potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.
In addition, new comprehensive state privacy laws, including laws that are now effective or will take effect in the near term in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, give users enhanced rights to limit our use of personal information as well as other rights and certain remedies in the event we fail to comply. Compliance with these new laws entails substantial expenses, diverts resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. One of the laws that became effective in 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data processing, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. The CPRA also created a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations, which could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement.
