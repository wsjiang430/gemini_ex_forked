Overview
 We are a clinical-stage genetic medicines company pioneering a new approach to the care of cardiovascular disease, or CVD, transforming treatment from chronic management to single-course gene editing medicines. Despite advances in treatment over the last 50 years, CVD remains the leading cause of death worldwide. The current paradigm of chronic care is fragile—requiring rigorous patient adherence, extensive healthcare infrastructure and regular healthcare access—and leaves many patients without adequate care. Our goal is to disrupt the chronic care model for CVD by providing a new therapeutic approach with single-course in vivo gene editing treatments focused on addressing the root causes of this highly prevalent and life-threatening disease. Our initial two programs target PCSK9 and ANGPTL3, respectively, genes that have been extensively validated as targets for lowering blood lipids, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C. We believe that editing these genes could potently and durably lower LDL-C throughout the lifetime of patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, the most common form of CVD.
Our approach leverages multiple breakthroughs in 21st century biomedicine—human genetic analysis, gene editing, messenger RNA, or mRNA, -based therapies and lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, delivery—to target genes that are predominantly expressed in the liver and disrupt the production of proteins that cause CVD. We are advancing a pipeline of single-course in vivo gene editing programs, each designed to mimic natural disease resistance mutations and turn off specific genes in order to lower blood lipids, thereby reducing the risk of ASCVD. We intend to initially develop these programs for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH, a genetic disease that causes life-long severely elevated blood LDL-C, leading to increased risk of early-onset ASCVD. If our programs are successful in FH, we believe they could also provide a potential treatment for the broader population of patients with established ASCVD. Ultimately, we believe that these treatments could potentially be developed for administration to people at risk for ASCVD as a preventative measure similar to the way that certain vaccines offer long-term protection against infectious diseases.
High cumulative life-long exposure to LDL-C drives the development of atherosclerotic plaque that results in the hardening of arteries seen in ASCVD. The relationship between lowering of cumulative LDL-C exposure and reduction in the risk of ASCVD is among the best understood relationships in medicine. Studies have shown that lowering LDL-C by 39 mg/dL for five years in patients with established ASCVD reduces the risk of a further event by 21%, whereas a similar degree of LDL-C difference over a lifetime reduces the risk of a first ASCVD event by 88%. This demonstrates that the challenge is not only to substantially reduce LDL-C but also to sustain such a reduction throughout a patient’s lifetime. We believe that the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of ASCVD must be early and aggressive reduction of LDL-C for as long as possible.
The current standard of care is a chronic care model that often fails to sufficiently control overall LDL-C exposure due to the continuous and life-long nature of its treatment approaches and the inherent adherence issues it presents. As a result, a large proportion of patients with established ASCVD have LDL-C levels above the goal recommended by the American Heart Association, or the AHA, and the American College of Cardiology, or the ACC, leaving them at risk for recurrent ASCVD events and the potential for invasive medical procedures or even death. Furthermore, given the silent nature of the damage done by elevated LDL-C, many patients at risk for ASCVD do not properly appreciate the therapeutic benefits of consistent treatment as well as the substantial risk of foregoing treatment, focusing instead on the heavy, life-long medication burden of daily pills, lifestyle changes and other chronic approaches. We believe that single-course gene editing treatments that potently and durably control cumulative LDL-C exposure could fundamentally disrupt the chronic care model for treating patients with or at risk for ASCVD and relieve the significant burden placed on patients, providers and the healthcare system.
 Our lead product candidate, VERVE-101, is designed to permanently turn off the PCSK9 gene in the liver. PCSK9 is a highly validated target that plays a critical role in controlling blood LDL-C through its regulation of the LDL receptor, or LDLR. Reduction of PCSK9 protein in the blood improves the ability of the liver to clear LDL-C from the blood. VERVE-101 utilizes LNP-mediated delivery to target the liver and base editing technology to make a single base change at a specific site in the PCSK9 gene in order to disrupt PCSK9 protein production.
In an in vivo proof-of-concept study of a precursor formulation of VERVE-101 in non-human primates, or NHPs, we observed substantial lowering of LDL-C levels that was sustained over an extended period of time following

treatment. In this study, following a single intravenous infusion of a base editor targeting PCSK9, we observed an average reduction of blood PCSK9 protein of 89% accompanied by an average reduction of blood LDL-C levels of 59% at two weeks after treatment. This LDL-C reduction was maintained at an average of 71% for two years following treatment.
In an ongoing preclinical study with VERVE-101 in NHPs, we observed 70% mean editing following a single administration of 1.5 mg/kg dose at the PCSK9 target gene site in liver biopsies taken at day 15. In this study, we also observed an average reduction in blood PCSK9 protein of 79% accompanied by an average reduction of blood LDL-C levels of 62% at two weeks after treatment. These reductions were durable when assessed for one year after treatment, with mean reduction in blood PCSK9 protein of 89% and blood LDL-C levels of 68%.
 In addition, in our preclinical studies in NHPs, VERVE-101 has been well tolerated following a single administration with only mild elevations in liver function tests that resolved within two weeks. In primary human hepatocytes treated with VERVE-101, we observed on-target editing at the PCSK9 target site and did not observe significant editing at any of approximately 3,000 identified potential off-target sites.
Based on our preclinical data, we are advancing VERVE-101 initially for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH. We plan to expand clinical development of VERVE-101 in a stepwise fashion beyond HeFH for the treatment of patients with established ASCVD, who are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy, which represents hundreds of millions of potential patients globally. Ultimately, we believe that VERVE-101 may be useful to people at risk for ASCVD as a preventative measure in the general population.
The heart-1 trial is designed to enroll approximately 40 adult patients with HeFH who have established ASCVD and evaluate the safety and tolerability of VERVE-101 administration, with additional analyses for pharmacokinetics and reductions in blood PCSK9 protein and LDL-C. The trial includes three parts – (A) a single ascending dose portion, followed by (B) an expansion single-dose cohort, in which additional participants will receive the selected potentially therapeutic dose and (C) an optional second-dose cohort, in which eligible participants in lower dose cohorts in Part A have the option to receive a second treatment at the selected potentially therapeutic dose. During our interactions with regulators in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, country-specific protocols have been developed to account for various modifications to eligibility, design, and conduct in each country.
We have received clearance of our clinical trial applications, or CTAs, for VERVE-101 in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and in July 2022, we announced that the first patient had been dosed with VERVE-101 in our heart-1 clinical trial. In November 2022, we announced that we completed dosing of VERVE-101 in the first dose cohort of the dose-escalation portion of the heart-1 clinical trial, a global Phase 1b open-label clinical trial. Enrollment efforts are ongoing in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We plan to report initial safety and pharmacodynamic data from the dose-escalation portion of the heart-1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
 We submitted our investigational new drug, or IND, application to conduct a clinical trial evaluating VERVE-101 in patients with HeFH to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in October 2022 and were subsequently informed by the FDA that our IND application was placed on hold. In December 2022, we received a clinical hold letter from the FDA that outlined the information required to resolve the hold, including additional preclinical data relating to: (i) potency differences between human and non-human cells, (ii) risks of germline editing, and (iii) off-target analyses on non-hepatocyte cell types. Clinical data from the ongoing heart-1 clinical trial in New Zealand and the U.K. were not included in the IND application package submitted to the FDA. In the clinical hold letter, the FDA requested available clinical data from the trial. In addition, the FDA has requested that we modify the trial protocol in the United States to incorporate additional contraceptive measures and to increase the length of the staggering interval between dosing of participants. We intend to submit our response to the FDA as expeditiously as possible.
 VERVE-201, our development candidate targeting ANGPTL3,is designed to permanently turn off the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver. ANGPTL3 is a key regulator of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. We believe that disrupting ANGPTL3 protein production may lead to reductions in LDL-C and triglyceride levels through a mechanism distinct from that of PCSK9. We plan to develop this program for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH, which affects approximately 1,300 people in the United States, as well as for refractory hypercholesterolemia defined as people with ASCVD who are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy and a PCSK9 inhibitor. Ultimately, we believe that VERVE-201 may also be useful to people at risk for ASCVD as a preventative measure in the general population. We are conducting preclinical studies to support a regulatory filing for the initiation of clinical development of VERVE-201 and anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in 2024.

For VERVE-201, we plan to utilize internally developed GalNAc-LNP to deliver a base editor targeting the ANGPTL3 gene to the liver. In patients with HoFH, delivery of base editors with standard LNPs to the liver is challenging due to the deficiency of LDLR, which is known to mediate LNP uptake. We have developed proprietary LNPs with a GalNAc ligand designed to bind to asialoglycoprotein receptors, or ASGPR, in the liver, which bypass LDLR, thereby enabling uptake into the liver in HoFH patients.
 In our preclinical studies of a precursor formulation of VERVE-201 we used a single treatment of two different formulations of our proprietary GalNAc-LNPs to deliver an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor. We observed approximately 94% (n=3) and 97% (n=3) reduction in blood ANGPTL3 protein, and reductions in LDL-C of nearly 100 mg/dL, which was an approximately 35% reduction from baseline. We conducted these studies in an internally developed NHP model of HoFH, which we created by editing the LDLR gene in wild-type NHPs and eliminating LDLR expression in the livers of NHPs using a Cas9 and dual guide RNA strategy encapsulated in standard LNPs. In this model, we achieved nearly 70% whole liver DNA editing at the LDLR gene, resulting in an approximately 94% reduction in LDLR protein in the liver and a six-fold increase in blood LDL-C.
 In a proof of concept study of an ANGPTL3 base editor in NHPs (n=4), we observed an approximate 96% reduction in blood ANGPTL3 protein from baseline, with follow-up out to two years. In addition, no long-term impacts were observed on markers of liver toxicity, as measured by alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels following treatment administration.
 We have also assessed the potential broad utility of our proprietary GalNAc-LNP approach for delivery of an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor, in a preclinical study evaluating delivery efficiency of our ANGPTL3 base editor using either a GalNAc-LNP or a standard LNP without GalNAc in wild-type NHPs with normal livers. In these studies, we observed that wild-type NHPs treated with our ANGPTL3-targeted base editor delivered via our GalNAc-LNP had an approximately 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein compared to an approximately 74% reduction in wild-type NHPs treated with a standard LNP.
 We are continuing to invest and build out capabilities in the development of novel and optimized GalNAc-targeting ligands, optimal lipid anchors, optimal compositions and ratios of LNP components, and optimal processes of addition and LNP formation with targeting ligands. We believe GalNAc provides a delivery platform for patients with both forms of FH and potentially may be applicable in other applications where liver-directed delivery is advantageous. We have also generated data where we observed that the GalNac-LNP can efficiently deliver base editors targeting PCSK9 as well. In this study, we observed approximately 87% reduction in blood PCSK9 protein after delivering a base editor targeting PCSK9 using GalNac-PCSK9 LNPs in wild-type NHPs. We believe this data suggests that GalNAc-LNP delivery may have broad utility for liver editing in other indications and are advancing a GalNAc-LNP delivered PCSK9 base editor into preclinical development.
 We are focused on building the preeminent company developing gene editing medicines to treat patients with CVD, the world’s leading cause of mortality. We intend to leverage the expertise and capabilities of our team to expand our pipeline beyond PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 and apply our single-course gene editing approach to additional in vivo liver gene editing treatments, such as our program targeting lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), to develop a suite of single-course gene editing medicines that address the root causes of disease.

Transforming cardiovascular care
Despite advances in treatment over the last 50 years, CVD remains a global epidemic. The current paradigm of chronic care is fragile—requiring rigorous patient adherence, extensive healthcare infrastructure and regular healthcare access—and leaves many patients without adequate care. CVD remains the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for nearly one in three deaths according to the World Health Organization. It is also a leading contributor to reductions in life expectancy and is one of the most expensive health conditions in the United States. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, CVD costs the U.S. healthcare system more than $350 billion per year in annual costs and lost productivity. Our goal is to disrupt the chronic care model for CVD by providing a new therapeutic approach focused on addressing the root causes of this highly prevalent and life-threatening disease.
CVD collectively refers to diseases of the heart and blood vessels, which are diagnosed as ASCVD, among others, as depicted in the figure below. In ASCVD, a large subset of CVD, cholesterol drives the development of atherosclerotic plaque, a mixture of cholesterol, cells and cellular debris in the wall of a blood vessel that results in the hardening of the arteries.




High cumulative life-long exposure to blood cholesterol, which is carried in each of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein, or TRL, or Lp(a), is a root cause of ASCVD. The graphic below depicts these liver-produced lipoproteins being secreted into the blood and their typical compositions, comprising cholesterol and triglycerides and with apolipoprotein B, or ApoB, on the surface. Each of these three lipoproteins represents an independent pathway of risk for ASCVD, and we believe that concurrently reducing the blood lipids carried in more than one of these pathways should provide additive benefit for the treatment of ASCVD.





Current treatment approaches to lower LDL-C utilize continuous, life-long treatment, and due to the limitations of this chronic care model, cumulative exposure to LDL-C for many patients with ASCVD remains insufficiently controlled. The most common treatment for patients with ASCVD is daily statin pills in combination with recommended therapeutic lifestyle changes. There are several non-statin daily pills, including ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants and bempedoic acid, that may be used alone or added sequentially to statin treatment in order to help patients with ASCVD reach recommended LDL-C goals. There are also two FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, evolocumab and alirocumab, that target and bind to PCSK9 protein and are typically administered via injection twice per month. In addition, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, that targets PCSK9 and is subcutaneously administered twice per year, was approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Administration, or EMA. Despite these approved treatments, effectively controlling LDL-C levels long-term in patients with or at high risk for ASCVD remains a significant unmet need.
The relationship between lowering of cumulative LDL-C exposure and reduction in the risk of ASCVD is among the best understood relationships in medicine. Human genetic studies have shown that those with FH, a genetic disease, have life-long severely elevated blood LDL-C, which can lead to increased risk of early-onset ASCVD. Conversely, individuals born with resistance mutations that turn off a cholesterol-raising gene expressed in the liver, such as PCSK9, have life-long low levels of LDL-C and rarely suffer from ASCVD. These insights point to the importance of early aggressive treatment to reduce LDL-C exposure over a patient’s lifetime. For patients with established ASCVD, such as those who have previously suffered a heart attack, clinical treatment guidelines published by the AHA/ACC recommend lowering blood LDL-C to a goal of less than 70 mg/dL, and the European Society of Cardiology, or ESC, recommends lowering blood LDL-C to a goal of less than 55 mg/dL. If blood LDL-C is maintained low enough for long enough, the risk of a first ASCVD event, including a heart attack, can be dramatically reduced. Studies have shown that lowering LDL-C by 39 mg/dL for five years in patients with established ASCVD reduces the risk of a further event by 21%, whereas a similar degree of LDL-C difference over a lifetime reduces the risk of a first ASCVD event by up to 88%.
Despite the availability of statin and non-statin therapies, cumulative exposure to LDL-C is often insufficiently controlled in many patients with ASCVD. As a result, a large proportion of patients with established ASCVD have LDL-C levels above clinical treatment guidelines. In a national registry of outpatient cardiovascular care in the United States, out of 2.6 million patients who had suffered a clinical ASCVD event, 53% had not received any cholesterol-lowering therapy and 72% remained above the LDL-C levels recommended by the AHA/ACC. Further, data from a clinical trial of approximately 6,000 patients in the year following a heart attack showed that among the approximately 3,000 patients for whom the medication was provided for free, only 39% reported full adherence to their statin therapy.
A large proportion of patients with or at risk for ASCVD opt against starting or remaining on treatment due to the heavy, life-long medication burden associated with daily pills or frequent injections. Given the silent nature of the damage done by elevated LDL-C, many patients at risk for ASCVD do not properly appreciate the therapeutic benefits of consistent treatment as well as the substantial risk of foregoing treatment, focusing instead on the heavy, life-long medication burden of chronic approaches. Numerous prior studies of statins and injectable mAb PCSK9 inhibitors showed that treatment discontinuation is frequent. The graphic below illustrates findings from

two of these studies, which showed that 50% of patients or fewer remain on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitor mAbs or statins over four years.



Incomplete adherence to treatment may result in significant oscillation in blood LDL-C levels over a patient’s lifetime. The illustrative graphic below depicts the journey of a hypothetical patient with FH who began standard-of-care treatment after suffering a heart attack at age 44, at which point the patient was diagnosed with ASCVD, and the potential consequences of incomplete control of LDL-C over several years due to poor adherence and insufficient healthcare access. Incomplete LDL-C control can lead to recurrent clinical ASCVD events and the need for invasive medical procedures, such as intracoronary stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery, and can be fatal. These recurrent events and procedures place a heavy burden on patients, treating providers and the medical system as a whole, with increased cost and use of healthcare services.




Advantages of our single-course gene editing treatments for ASCVD
We believe that single-course gene editing treatments for patients with ASCVD have the potential to solve many of the challenges of the chronic care model and create a new paradigm for the treatment of this highly prevalent

and life-threatening disease. By potently and durably controlling cumulative LDL-C exposure throughout a patient’s lifetime, we believe our gene editing medicines could fundamentally disrupt the chronic care model for patients with or at risk for ASCVD and relieve the significant burden placed on patients, providers and the healthcare system. The illustrative graphic below depicts the journey of the same hypothetical patient with FH who, in this case, received a single-course gene editing treatment after suffering a heart attack and avoided recurrent ASCVD events as a result.



To achieve our goal of transforming the treatment of ASCVD, we are developing a pipeline of single-course gene editing treatments that leverage multiple breakthroughs of 21st century biomedicine—human genetic analysis, gene editing, mRNA-based therapies and LNP-mediated delivery. We believe our approach benefits from the following potential advantages:
•Validated liver targets implicated in ASCVD risk: Our approach specifically targets genes that are predominantly expressed in the liver and have been validated through human genetics research. Naturally occurring mutations in each of these target genes are associated with a reduced risk of ASCVD. Our gene editing programs are designed to mimic these natural resistance mutations to turn off specific genes in the liver implicated in the risks of ASCVD. Such resistance mutations in PCSK9, even in adults with homozygous mutations and complete PCSK9 protein deficiency, do not appear to have any serious adverse health consequences. Furthermore, there is established human pharmacologic proof-of-concept and positive tolerability profiles with other modalities targeting these genes, such as mAbs, siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides. 
 •Potent, durable and life-long lowering of blood lipids through a single-course treatment: We are leveraging gene editing technologies, including base editing, to make a permanent change in the target gene and disrupt the production of specific proteins that cause ASCVD. The durability of a gene editing approach appears to hold true in tissues with cell turnover, such as the liver, since the edit is passed on as cells divide. With VERVE-101, we are leveraging base editing with the goal of potently and permanently reducing blood lipids in order to create the potential for a life-long therapeutic outcome. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study in NHPs using a precursor formulation of VERVE-101, we observed a 59% reduction in blood LDL-C at two weeks after treatment, with LDL-C reduction maintained at an average of 71% at two years. In another preclinical proof-of-concept study in NHPs, we observed that a single administration of a precursor formulation of VERVE-201 targeting ANGPTL3 resulted in a 64% reduction in blood triglycerides at two weeks after treatment, with triglyceride reduction maintained at an average of 69% at ten months. We believe that our gene editing approach has the potential to potently and durably lower blood lipids throughout a patient’s lifetime, thereby reducing their risk of ASCVD. 
 •Designed and optimized to reduce or avoid safety risks: To optimize the safety profile of our gene editing programs, we utilize non-viral LNP delivery of a gene editor to the liver due to the potentially superior safety profile of LNPs compared with available viral delivery approaches, specifically the minimization of genome integration risk and immunogenicity. In addition, we use base editing for our initial programs, which enables 


highly precise editing at the single base pair level and minimizes the risks of unwanted DNA modifications associated with double-stranded breaks from nuclease-based editing approaches. Finally, we extensively screen pairs of gene editors with guide RNA, or gRNA, in human cells, mice and NHPs to maximize the likelihood that our gene editing programs will have limited or no off-target editing effects. For VERVE-101, we have identified a base editor paired with a gRNA targeting PCSK9 and have not observed any significant off-target editing in preclinical studies using primary human hepatocytes.
•A suite of complementary single-course gene editing treatments to broadly reduce blood lipids and ASCVD risk: We are focused on targeting distinct pathways implicated in elevated blood lipid levels and related ASCVD risk. VERVE-101, our lead program, is designed to target the PCSK9 gene, a validated regulator of blood LDL-C levels. VERVE-201 is designed to target the ANGPTL3 gene, a regulator of both cholesterol and triglycerides that contributes to ASCVD risk independent of the PCSK9 pathway. We believe that patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia may benefit from treatment with VERVE-201.
 •Potential to manufacture our programs in a scalable manner to reach a broad population: We have designed our single-course treatments as LNPs encapsulating mRNA and gRNA, a similar construction to that used in mRNA-based vaccines approved by the FDA for the prevention of COVID-19. We believe we will benefit from the rapid increase in investment, validation and real-world application of these technologies on a global scale as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which should enhance our potential to manufacture our gene editing programs for use with a broad patient population. We believe that scalable manufacturing is paramount to unlocking the true potential of our single-course gene editing treatments to tackle the worldwide burden of ASCVD. 
 Our strategy
We are executing a strategy with the following key elements:
•Employ a stepwise approach to realize the full potential of VERVE-101and VERVE-201. We are pioneering a new approach with single-course gene editing medicines aimed at transforming the care of patients with or at risk for ASCVD. We are initially developing VERVE-101 for the treatment of HeFH, a genetic cardiovascular disorder that causes life-long elevated LDL-C levels and leads to early-onset ASCVD. We are initially developing VERVE-201 for the treatment of HoFH, a genetic cardiovascular disorder that causes extremely elevated LDL-C levels. If we successfully develop VERVE-101 for the treatment of patients with HeFH, we believe it could also be used to treat the broader population of patients with established ASCVD who are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy. Ultimately, we believe these treatments could be potentially developed for administration to people at risk for ASCVD as a preventative measure. We are currently enrolling HeFH patients in our heart-1 clinical trial in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We plan to report initial safety and pharmacodynamic data from the dose-escalation portion of the heart-1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
•Expand our pipeline of gene editing treatments within ASCVD and beyond to additional CVD indications. We are expanding beyond our PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 programs with other early stage discovery programs, including one directed at Lp(a), another root cause of ASCVD, using a novel gene editor tailored to target the LPA gene. We intend to develop a suite of single-course gene editing medicines that comprehensively and robustly address additional independent causes of CVD. We believe our approach may be applicable to additional CVD indications with high unmet need driven by mutations in target genes expressed in the liver. 
 •Expand portfolio of single-course in vivo gene editing programs through strategic relationships. In July 2022, we established an exclusive, four-year global research collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, focused on discovering and developing an in vivo gene editing program for a single undisclosed liver disease using a novel gene editor tailored to the gene target. We may enter into additional collaborations intended to develop novel in vivo gene editing programs for targets of interest.
 •Leverage our expertise and access to multiple gene editing technologies to become the leader in gene editing for CVD. We believe that the deep expertise of our team in human genetics, gene editing and off-target analysis combined with multiple in-licensed technologies, including base editing and CRISPR nucleases, positions us to be able to develop single-course gene editing medicines designed to make a precise, predictable and permanent change in a target gene for the treatment of CVD. For each new target, our expertise allows us to systematically evaluate multiple gene editing technologies, including developing novel gene editing technologies, in primary human hepatocytes, mice and NHPs to identify the optimal approach based on potential efficacy and safety. We believe that our focus on developing gene editing medicines to treat CVD enables us to move rapidly and has culminated in the first ever patient dosed with an in vivo base editor. 


We are also working to develop novel gene editors tailored to a particular target of interest, including as part of our Vertex collaboration and our research efforts for our Lp(a) program.
 •Advance LNP delivery technology leveraging both external as well as internal LNP capabilities to deliver gene editors to the liver. On a target-by-target basis, we evaluate the best options for non-viral delivery from our external partnerships or our internal LNP discovery platform. For our lead program, VERVE-101, we have licensed LNP technology from Acuitas, an established company with a track record of partnering and developing LNPs for clinical use. We have also licensed lipid technology from Novartis which we intend to use in research and development of certain product candidates. Additionally, our internal team’s expertise in biodegradable LNP chemistry, formulation and manufacturing has allowed us to develop and screen potent, liver-directed LNPs, including novel liver-targeting GalNAc-LNPs, which may offer superior delivery in certain CVD patient populations. We are utilizing proprietary GalNAc-LNPs in addition to the licensed Novartis lipid technology to deliver VERVE-201 to the liver. We are also evaluating GalNAc-LNPs to deliver a base editor targeting the PCSK9 gene.
 •Prioritize rapid iteration of product candidates in NHP preclinical models as an early development strategy. We believe that studies in NHPs are a powerful predictor of efficacy in humans for gene editing and LNP delivery to the liver. Our preclinical validation approach prioritizes NHP experiments early in the process, enabling us to rapidly optimize drug product development to identify a lead candidate to take into clinical development. With VERVE-101 and VERVE-201, the bulk of our preclinical studies have been performed in NHPs, allowing us to establish the pharmacodynamic relationship between liver editing and resulting reductions in circulating PCSK9 protein, ANGPTL3 protein, and LDL-C that we believe will translate into humans. 
 •Develop manufacturing capabilities to produce in vivo gene editing medicines at scale. We are currently working with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, vendors to produce all components of our drug candidates for our clinical trial batches. We have successfully executed batches at clinical scale through our vendors. We have also developed proprietary production processes designed to yield high-purity and high-quality mRNA that are crucial for in vivo liver editing applications. We are continuing to invest in building internal manufacturing capabilities for mRNA and LNP production, in order to fulfill our vision of delivering gene editing medicines to millions of patients with CVD. 
 •Build the leading cardiovascular gene editing company by maintaining a dynamic culture that attracts and retains a talented and collaborative team. We have attracted a talented team of scientists, cardiologists, drug developers and business professionals, as well as experts in the fields of human genetics, gene editing technologies, mRNA biology, off-target analysis and genetic medicine delivery modalities. Developing gene editing medicines that transform the care of CVD requires that we solve many new and complex problems as a natural component of the drug discovery and development process. Our vision, values, talent and strategy are essential to maximizing our ability to address these problems and bring forward a new approach to treating the leading cause of the death in the world. 
 Our approach
We are employing a tailored approach aimed at developing single-course gene editing medicines to transform treatment for patients with CVD. Our gene editing programs target validated genes in the liver that are supported by extensive human genetics and human pharmacology data and are known to be implicated in CVD. We use base editing, a next-generation gene editing approach that enables precise and efficient editing at the single base level in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA, for our initial programs, including VERVE-101 and VERVE-201. Our gene editing programs consist of LNPs that encapsulate mRNA encoding for a gene or base editor as well as a gRNA targeting the gene of interest expressed in the liver. We believe that the following key elements of our approach will help us achieve our goal of delivering gene editing treatments on a global scale for millions of patients with CVD.

We selected gene editing as the core technology to develop our single-course gene editing treatments for CVD because we believe it offers the potential for durability of effect and versatility in the type of genetic modification compared to other genetic medicine approaches, including gene therapy and RNA therapeutics. We have access to multiple gene editing technologies through licenses including base editing and CRISPR nucleases. We are also seeking to discover new gene editing technologies. We believe having the flexibility to apply different gene editing technologies to different single-course treatments for CVD enables us to identify the best potential option for any given therapeutic application.

CRISPR-Cas Editing
 CRISPR-Cas is a form of nuclease-based gene editing that enables targeting of genomic DNA sequences with high specificity in human cells by assessing for a match between the gRNA sequence and the DNA sequence. The gRNA allows the Cas protein to recognize a complementary part of the DNA sequence. Once RNA-DNA pairing occurs, the Cas enzyme makes a double-stranded DNA break, and the cell’s natural DNA repair mechanisms work to make changes or repair the genome. When the repair is faulty, there can be disruption of a target gene, known as a knockout. CRISPR-Cas is effective at knocking out, or silencing, a targeted gene through disruption. However, potential limitations of standard CRISPR-Cas gene editing include lack of predictability in genetic outcomes and potential toxicities associated with double-stranded DNA breaks.
Base Editing
 Base editing is a next-generation gene editing approach that enables precise and efficient editing at the single base level in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. If CRISPR-Cas gene editing approaches are akin to “scissors” for the genome, base editors are akin to “pencils,” erasing and rewriting one letter in a gene.
Through our license agreement with Beam, we have access to two different types of base editors—adenine base editors, or ABEs, and cytosine base editors, or CBEs, each of which has a modified Cas9 protein bound to a gRNA, retaining the ability to target a genomic sequence, yet avoiding double-stranded DNA breaks. The base editors are distinguished by the kind of deaminase, the base editing enzyme that carries out the chemical modification, that is fused to Cas9. The deaminase makes a predictable chemical modification, called deamination, of the amine group on either an adenine, or A, base or a cytosine, or C, base as shown in the figure below.




For VERVE-101 and VERVE-201, we are using an ABE to convert an amine group of A to an inosine, or I, base, which is read by DNA polymerase as a guanine, or G, base, leading ultimately to an A-to-G spelling change. Once the initial modification has occurred, the intermediate DNA consists of an edited strand, containing an I at the target site, and an unedited strand with a thymine, or T, base. The I:T base pair is a mismatch, which the cell will normally attempt to repair in a process that can potentially lose the edit. In order to preserve the editing, our base editors cleave the unedited single strand of the DNA, referred to as nicking, rather than creating double-stranded breaks. The presence of the nick on the unedited strand, however, increases the efficiency of editing by inducing the cell to use the newly edited strand, and not the unedited strand, as the template for repair, resulting in an I:C base pair. Upon DNA repair or replication, the I is read as a G, resulting in a G:C base pair, and the permanent conversion of an A:T base pair to a G:C base pair is completed. This single base pair change at the specific site within the PCSK9 or ANGPTL3 gene alters the gene in such a way that no functional PCSK9 or ANGPTL3 protein is made, disrupting its role in maintaining elevated levels of circulating blood lipids.
Target selection
We focus on validated genes in the liver-cardiovascular axis, which are genes predominantly expressed in the liver and where disrupting protein production or introducing a beneficial mutation may effectively treat an underlying cause of CVD. When considering targets for our programs, we evaluate the following criteria:
•human genetic evidence that loss-of-function, or LoF, mutations confer resistance to disease; 


•human genetic evidence that LoF mutations do not have adverse effects, and that homozygous LoF, inheriting two mutant alleles, are well tolerated; 
 •human clinical proof-of-concept data for targeting with other modalities to support the potential safety and efficacy of permanent gene or base editing; 
 •technical efficiencies, such as liver-predominant expression and known estimates of the pharmacodynamic relationship between target protein and therapeutic effect;
•existence of circulating protein biomarkers for efficacy, clinical biomarkers of disease modulation, and the availability of appropriate preclinical disease models; and 
 •clear unmet medical need and development rationale for the target indications. 
 Evaluating for off-target editing
Gene editing enables precise alterations at specific locations in the genome but has the potential to make alterations at undesired locations, known as off-target editing. Base editing has inherently fewer risks for off-target editing than CRISPR-Cas nuclease editing given the precision and efficiency of editing at the single base pair level and ability to make the edit without making a double-stranded DNA break.
Our approach to minimizing off-target editing involves the use of multiple orthogonal assays that provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential for off-target editing with our editors. These include in vitro methods that detect editing at single-nucleotide resolution via DNA sequencing, such as ONE-seq which utilizes a computationally designed synthetic DNA library with sequence similarity to the on-target locus or Digenome-seq where DNA extracted from cells provides an un-biased assessment of edited loci. Both methods provide a complementary and rigorous workflow for candidate site nomination. We have also developed a highly sensitive hybrid capture assay for assessing these nominated candidate sites and assays for assessing structural variants and guide-independent effects across the genome and transcriptome. We believe that our internal expertise in the application of multiple innovative techniques to evaluate off-target editing gives us a leading position in the field and the ability to rapidly advance future programs.
Lipid nanoparticle delivery selection
Gene editing treatments require intracellular delivery of mRNA and gRNA molecules into the target cell type—in our case, hepatocytes in the liver—and all of our programs utilize a non-viral approach, LNPs, for delivery. LNPs are well-established, both by approved products and by clinical trials conducted by others with other agents, to preferentially accumulate in the liver after systemic administration. We have chosen non-viral LNP delivery due to the potentially superior safety profile compared with available viral delivery approaches, as well as the high efficiencies of liver editing achievable with LNPs due to their natural tropism to the liver.
Non-viral delivery to the liver with LNPs confers potential advantages, including:
•protection of the mRNA and gRNA payloads while in circulation in the blood; 
 •transient expression of gene editing proteins, allowing more control over the editing process; 
 •transient expression of the editing protein and rapid completion of the editing process within days, minimizing immunogenicity; 
 •absence of DNA or viral components, avoiding exogenous DNA capable of inserting into the genome; 
 •rapid degradation of drug product within one to two weeks, supporting the potential for long-term safety; 
 •known, manageable infusion-related side effects; and 
 •cost-effective manufacturing with potential to efficiently scale to reach millions of patients. 
 To date, our LNP discovery platform has yielded novel proprietary ionizable lipids that we have designed, synthesized and evaluated for their potential to deliver gene editing payloads to the liver in mice. We are further optimizing and scaling up such formulations for evaluation in NHPs. We have also developed novel targeting ligands that when added to LNPs allow for more efficient delivery of RNA payloads to the liver.
 On a target-by-target basis, we evaluate the optimal LNP delivery options from either external partnerships or our internal LNP discovery platform. For our lead program, VERVE-101, we have licensed LNP technology from Acuitas, an established company with a track record of partnering and developing LNPs for clinical use. Our collaboration with Acuitas included several NHP studies to evaluate various LNP formulations and RNA payloads prior to selecting an Acuitas LNP for VERVE-101. For VERVE-201, we have licensed LNP technology from Novartis and plan to use internally developed GalNAc-LNP technology for delivery.



We view our internal LNP discovery platform as an important source of delivery technology for future therapeutic programs. We are optimizing our internal LNP discovery platform by focusing on:
•strategies to enhance delivery to the liver in certain CVD patient populations, such as patients with HoFH, in whom LNP-mediated delivery may be challenging; 
 •improved efficiency of delivery to the liver, such that lower doses of RNA payload could be used; 
 •wider therapeutic indices to optimize the benefit-risk profile of our product candidates; and 
 •improved stability and potential for powder formulation enabling easier storage for commercial application. 
 We believe that our internal LNP discovery platform will yield improvement in our product candidates for current and future programs.
We are continuing to invest and build out capabilities in the development of novel and optimized GalNAc-targeting ligands, optimal lipid anchors, optimal compositions and ratios of LNP components, and optimal processes of addition and LNP formation with targeting ligands. We believe GalNAc provides a delivery platform for patients with both forms of FH and potentially may be applicable in other applications where liver-directed delivery is advantageous.
 Single-course therapy
We are designing our single-course gene editing treatments to be administered as single-dose regimens through intravenous infusion, which is supported by data generated in our preclinical studies in NHPs. However, an advantage of using LNPs is the potential for split-dosing. In the case of our gene editing programs, we may elect to dose patients using a single, short course consisting of a limited number of split-doses over a short period of time to improve safety, efficacy or both. In patients who may not receive an adequate therapeutic effect with a single course of treatment, our approach may enable the option to re-dose. Patisiran, an approved LNP-encapsulated siRNA, is chronically administered without safety and efficacy concerns for patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR. This is in contrast to viral vectors, which face safety and efficacy challenges with re-dosing.
The value of a single-course gene editing treatment will be determined by the safety, potency and durability of its desired effect. We believe a single-course treatment with VERVE-101 could durably lower LDL-C throughout the lifetime of patients with or at risk for ASCVD. Our gene editing treatments are designed to make a permanent change in the DNA of liver cells. With VERVE-101, transient expression of ABE protein in hepatocytes is designed to lead to permanent editing of the PCSK9 gene. Since liver cells turn over predominantly through division of hepatocytes that themselves will carry the PCSK9 edit, we believe that the efficacy resulting from the edit will be durable.
This stands in contrast to gene therapy, where the therapeutic benefit has been challenged by a lack of durability. Gene therapies are often designed to express exogenous mRNA by viral delivery or viral expression of mRNA. The durability of therapeutic effect can be limited by the loss of mRNA expression from a viral vector that does not integrate into the genome. This leads to either a reliance on viral integration at unpredictable sites in the genome, which can lead to safety challenges, or on repeat dosing that has its own challenges with viral delivery.
We believe that single-course gene editing treatments could provide durable and transformative outcomes, producing sustained health benefits for patients with CVD.

Scalable manufacturing
By designing our gene editing treatments as LNPs encapsulating mRNA and gRNA, we expect to benefit from the potential for scalable and cost-effective manufacturing processes enabling the opportunity to treat millions of patients with CVD.
Our product candidates are similar to two validated and approved drug classes: LNP-encapsulated siRNAs, such as patisiran, and LNP-encapsulated mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which are LNPs containing a long mRNA molecule for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Significant and ongoing investments are being made by multiple organizations to enhance the supply chain for all components and processes related to mRNA production, LNP production and fill-finish, especially in light of the intense worldwide efforts to manufacture massive quantities of COVID-19 vaccines. We believe we will ultimately benefit from the increased global capacity for LNP-encapsulated mRNA production over the next several years.
We are currently working with GMP vendors to produce all components of our drug candidates for our clinical trial batches. These include plasmid DNA preparation, mRNA production via in vitro transcription reactions, gRNA

synthesis via solid state synthesis, lipid synthesis and LNP formulation and fill finish. Working closely with these vendors, we have successfully executed batches at clinical scale.
 We are also investing in the buildout of internal process development capabilities in mRNA production and LNP formulation, which we believe will become one of our core competencies in the future. The goals of this internal process development capability are to scale up plasmid DNA, mRNA and LNP production batches, to make improvements in order to enhance quality, consistency and stability, and to reduce costs. Further, we are investing in analytical method development including bioactivity and potency assays that will be critical to further product development, batch comparability assessments and additional manufacturing growth.
Our gene editing programs
We are advancing a pipeline of single-course in vivo gene editing programs intended to durably turn off genes in the liver implicated in CVD. Our gene editing programs consist of LNPs that encapsulate mRNA encoding for a gene editor as well as a gRNA targeting the gene of interest expressed in the liver. Our pipeline is focused on genes implicated in the control of blood lipids, as well as other liver-mediated targets in and outside of CVD. We are developing our lead programs initially for the treatment of patients with forms of FH, which is a genetic disorder leading to life-long severely elevated blood LDL-C and increased risk of early-onset ASCVD. Patients with FH have mutations predominantly in the LDLR gene that affect the ability of liver cells to remove LDL from the circulation. FH manifests clinically in two forms: the more common heterozygous form, known as HeFH, and the rarer homozygous form, known as HoFH.
 
The following graphic summarizes our pipeline of programs.

Our most advanced product candidate, VERVE-101 targeting the PCSK9 gene, is currently being studied in heart-1, our Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of VERVE-101 administration in a high risk subset of patients with HeFH in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Genetically defined HeFH affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States, 2.1 million in the European Union and the United Kingdom and approximately 31 million worldwide. We plan to report initial safety and pharmacodynamic data from the dose-escalation portion of the heart-1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
 We are strategically developing VERVE-101 initially in patients with HeFH, recognizing that the unmet need is highest in those patients and the benefit-risk profile may be more favorable. We intend to use a stepwise clinical development plan for VERVE-101, evaluating efficacy and safety in higher-risk populations first, and then if successful, expanding into a broader population of patients with established ASCVD who are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy, and ultimately to those at risk for ASCVD in the general population.
 We plan to develop VERVE-201, our development candidate targeting the ANGPTL3 gene, using a similar stepwise approach. We plan to develop this program for the treatment of HoFH, which affects approximately 1,300 people in the United States, as well as people with ASCVD who are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy and a PCSK9 inhibitor, or refractory hypercholesterolemia. Ultimately, we believe VERVE-201 may also be useful to people at risk for ASCVD as a preventative measure in the general population. We are conducting preclinical

studies to support a regulatory filing for the initiation of clinical development of VERVE-201 and anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in 2024.
 We intend to develop a broad pipeline of gene editing programs targeting distinct pathways implicated with ASCVD risk. Additionally, we believe our gene editing approach could have broader application for additional indications having both high unmet medical needs and validated gene targets expressed in the liver. With a focus on in vivo gene editing treatments, we plan to develop a suite of single-course gene editing medicines that address root causes of disease.
 Familial hypercholesterolemia: our initial focus for our single-course gene editing treatments
FH is a genetic disorder where patients have life-long severely elevated blood LDL-C, which can lead to increased risk of early-onset ASCVD. FH is an autosomal dominant disease often caused by a mutation in the LDLR gene. Individuals with FH may harbor one mutant allele and are thereby heterozygous for the disease, known as HeFH, or two mutated alleles and are therefore homozygous for the disease, known as HoFH. HoFH is typically more severe than HeFH.
Men and women with untreated HeFH typically have LDL-C levels ranging from approximately 200 to 400 mg/dL and develop ASCVD before age 50 and 60, respectively. The estimated prevalence of genetically defined HeFH is roughly one in 250, which translates to about 1.3 million patients in the United States. Men and women with HoFH have LDL-C levels above 500 mg/dL and typically develop ASCVD before the age of 20 and, without intervention, die before age 30. The estimated prevalence of genetically defined HoFH is roughly one in 250,000, which translates to about 1,300 patients in the United States.
FH can be clinically diagnosed based on a combination of factors, including the concentration of blood LDL-C, physical findings, personal or family history of hypercholesterolemia and early onset of ASCVD. Extensor tendon xanthomas, typically Achilles, subpatellar and hand extensor tendons, with extremely elevated LDL-C levels are considered specific for FH. However, FH is often silent until the development of a heart attack at a young age, at which time a family history of ASCVD and elevated LDL-C levels are often the only findings. In an analysis of the FH phenotype, which typically means LDL-C levels of greater than 190 mg/dL, from six prospective cohort studies with 30-year follow-up, the FH phenotype was associated with up to a five-fold elevated 30-year ASCVD risk. ASCVD development was accelerated in those with the FH phenotype by 10 to 20 years in men and 20 to 30 years in women. In HoFH, patients typically develop atherosclerosis in childhood, initially in the aortic root, causing supravalvular aortic stenosis, and then extending into the coronary arteries. If the LDL-C level is not effectively reduced, people with HoFH die prematurely of ASCVD. The severity of atherosclerosis in FH is proportional to the extent and duration of elevated blood LDL-C levels.
Although the diagnosis of FH can be made on the basis of clinical features, genetic testing may offer additional insight into cardiac risk and diagnosis. Recent analysis of data from more than 26,000 individuals suggests that at any given LDL-C level, having an identified FH mutation is associated with significantly higher ASCVD risk than having the same LDL-C level but no apparent pathogenic FH mutation. In this analysis, individuals with an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 190 mg/dL and no pathogenic FH mutation had a six-fold higher risk of ASCVD than the reference group with an LDL-C level less than or equal to 130 mg/dL. However, individuals with an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 190 mg/dL and a pathogenic FH mutation were at a 22-fold higher risk of ASCVD than the reference group, possibly reflecting greater atherogenicity of life-long LDL-C elevation in FH compared with LDL-C elevation acquired later in life.
While dietary and lifestyle changes are important for LDL-C lowering in patients with FH, multidrug treatment is often required to achieve recommended LDL-C levels. The recommended LDL-C levels for FH patients are similar to those for non-FH patients with ASCVD. Treatment for FH patients tends to start earlier than those with or at risk for ASCVD without FH, and typically follows a more aggressive course with multidrug treatment given the elevated risk of early-onset ASCVD. While FH patients are treated with medicines similar to those used for non-FH patients, the chronic care for FH patients is typically more burdensome with earlier intervention and more drugs. In addition, for many patients, especially those with HoFH, their LDL-C levels remain inadequately controlled and do not reach goals recommended by clinical treatment guidelines.
VERVE-101: PCSK9 program
Our lead product candidate, VERVE-101, is designed to be a single-course in vivo gene editing treatment targeting the PCSK9 gene. We plan to develop VERVE-101 initially for patients with HeFH, and, if successful, to expand development for the broader population of patients who have established ASCVD and are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy.

In patients with HeFH, a genetic mutation in the LDLR gene down-regulates LDLR expression, which limits the ability of liver cells to remove LDL from the bloodstream, resulting in extremely high LDL-C levels in the blood. Over time, high LDL-C builds up in the arteries, leading to formation of atherosclerotic plaque, reduced blood flow or blockage and ultimately heart attack or stroke. We believe that inactivation of the PCSK9 gene will result in lower PCSK9 protein levels, thereby increasing LDLR expression, leading to lower LDL-C levels and reduced risk for ASCVD. Clinical trials conducted by others evaluating PCSK9 inhibitors have suggested that targeting PCSK9 has the potential to work in patients with HeFH regardless of the underlying mutation.
VERVE-101 consists of an LNP encapsulating an mRNA encoding an ABE and a gRNA, as depicted in the image below. Four lipid components assemble along with the RNAs to form a dense, stable LNP that is approximately 60 nanometers in diameter.



VERVE-101 is designed to be infused intravenously into the patient over approximately one to two hours, and then accumulates in the liver. Prior to administration of VERVE-101, a pre-medication regimen is given that consists of antihistamines and steroids. Once in the liver, VERVE-101 is brought into hepatocytes and escapes into the cytoplasm where the base editor protein is transiently expressed. The gRNA then binds to the base editor protein, and the complex is carried into the nucleus to locate the gene target specified by the 20-nucleotide spacer sequence of the gRNA. The ABE binds to the DNA and makes a single A-to-G spelling change at the target site, thereby turning off the PCSK9 gene. The ABE mRNA construct is codon-optimized and contains chemical modifications to reduce the potential for mRNA-mediated immune responses. The gRNA sequence has several chemical modifications to enhance in vivo stability to endonucleases and exonucleases.
PCSK9 as a target
The PCSK9 gene plays a critical role in the regulation of blood LDL-C through its regulation of the LDLR gene. The normal function of PCSK9 is depicted in the figure below on the left. The PCSK9 gene produces a protein in the liver that is released into the blood. LDLR is present on the surface of liver cells and binds to LDL and removes LDL from circulation. The LDL bound to LDLR is taken up by liver cells to enable the breakdown of LDL particles. LDLR is then recycled back to the surface of the cell, enabling the process of LDL uptake to recur. PCSK9 protein in the blood interrupts this LDLR recycling process. Specifically, PCSK9 protein in the blood binds to LDLR and targets LDLR for destruction. In doing so, PCSK9 reduces the number of LDLRs on the liver cell surface, thereby reducing the ability of the liver to clear LDL from the blood. The figure on the right depicts a loss

of PCSK9 gene function, which results in less PCSK9 protein and thereby increased LDLR expression and uptake of LDL-C.



As reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, one study found that adults with naturally occurring LoF mutations in the PCSK9 gene had LDL-C levels that were 38 mg/dL lower than adults without the mutation, and those with the mutation had an 88% lower risk of ASCVD. Human genetic studies also showed that carrying naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in one or both copies of the PCSK9 gene was not associated with serious adverse health consequences.
In addition to human genetic studies, human pharmacology studies have provided validation for PCSK9 as a target. The impact of PCSK9 inhibition on cardiovascular outcomes has been established by two large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of two approved mAbs that bind to PCSK9 protein and block its activity, the FOURIER trial and the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial. The FOURIER trial demonstrated that treatment with evolocumab in addition to background statin therapy over a median of 2.2 years reduced major cardiovascular events by an additional 15% in patients with established ASCVD, with evidence of continued safety and increasing cardiovascular event reduction benefit that accrued over an additional 5.0 years of follow-up in the FOURIER open-label extension study. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial demonstrated that treatment with alirocumab in addition to background statin therapy over a median of 2.8 years reduced major cardiovascular events by an additional 15% in patients with established ASCVD. Treatment with these mAbs demonstrated an approximately 60% reduction in LDL-C on average across clinical trials when compared with placebo treatment. Notably, in both trials, with the exception of injection site reactions, overall adverse event rates were similar between patients treated with placebo or drug, with no observed increase of new-onset diabetes, worsening glycemic control or neurocognitive adverse events.
The PCSK9 target has been further validated by inclisiran, which was approved by the EMA in 2020 and by the FDA in December 2021. In the ORION-9 trial, the pivotal Phase 3 trial of inclisiran in patients with HeFH, the percent change in the PCSK9 level after 510 days was a decrease of 60.7% in the inclisiran-treated group compared with baseline, which led to a reduction in LDL-C after 510 days of 39.7% compared to baseline.
 We believe the human genetic studies and the human pharmacology with PCSK9 inhibitors provide substantial evidence that targeting PCSK9 is a potentially safe and effective approach to lower LDL-C and reduce ASCVD risk.
Preclinical studies
We discovered VERVE-101 based on extensive screening of a large library of gRNA candidates, evaluation of multiple LNP formulations and optimization of the ABE mRNA construct. We have tested a mouse surrogate of VERVE-101, precursor formulations of VERVE-101, which we refer to as our ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation, and VERVE-101 itself in vitro and in vivo across multiple animal models. In these studies, we have observed the following:
•high PCSK9 gene editing activity in the liver by a mouse surrogate of VERVE-101 in both wild type mice and heterozygous LDLR knockout mice, a well-established mouse model of HeFH; 


•two year NHP durability data for blood PCSK9 protein and LDL-C reduction following treatment with our ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation, with average reductions of 90% of PCSK9 protein and 71% for LDL-C; 
 •dose-responsive liver PCSK9 gene editing, blood PCSK9 protein reduction, and LDL-C reduction in NHPs, with a 1 mg/kg dose of VERVE-101 achieving approximately 71% editing, approximately 85% reduction in blood PCSK9 protein and approximately 64% reduction in LDL-C; 
 •one year NHP durability data for blood PCSK9 protein and LDL-C reduction following treatment with VERVE-101, with average reductions of 89% of PCSK9 protein and 68% for LDL-C;
 •VERVE-101 editing occurred predominantly in the liver and within 24 hours of treatment in NHP studies; 
 •evidence that VERVE-101 is potent in NHPs at doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg;
 •no evidence of germline editing in an analysis conducted in sexually mature male NHPs receiving a 1.5 mg/kg dose of VERVE-101;
 •no transmissions of the PCSK9 gene edit to the offspring of female mice treated with the murine surrogate of VERVE-101;
 •sustained editing of the PCSK9 gene in regenerated liver lobes at 95 days post-treatment, as demonstrated in a partial hepatectomy mouse model designed to determine durability of PCSK9 base editing in the liver;
 •administration of VERVE-101 to NHPs caused transient, mild elevations in liver function tests that entirely resolved within two weeks; and 
 •no significant off-target editing in primary human hepatocytes after evaluation at any of approximately 3,000 potential off-target sites. 
 In vivo validation with ABE-PCSK9 mouse surrogate
Our initial target patient population for VERVE-101 is patients with HeFH who produce reduced levels of functional LDLR, which results in increased levels of LDL-C in the blood. We utilized heterozygous LDLR knockout mice to model the HeFH disease state. A mouse surrogate version of VERVE-101 was developed for use in this model comprising a mouse surrogate gRNA targeting the ortholog of the same PCSK9 site, along with two components identical to VERVE-101—the ABE mRNA and LNP. As shown in the figure below, we observed that doses of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg of the mouse surrogate of VERVE-101 administered once to wild-type and heterozygous LDLR knockout mice resulted in similar and robust amounts of PCSK9 editing in the liver.





NHP validation with ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation
We then applied this approach in an NHP model to establish preclinical proof-of-concept using an ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation. In this study, which is ongoing, we administered a single dose to healthy NHPs. In the figures below, each treated NHP is represented by a purple bar and each vehicle treated control is represented by a blue bar. Following a single treatment with our ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation, we observed an average 67% editing of PCSK9 in whole liver tissue sampled through a liver biopsy two weeks after dosing, as shown in the first graph. This was accompanied by an average 89% reduction of blood PCSK9 protein and an average 59% reduction of blood LDL-C concentrations, as shown in the additional two graphs below.








Importantly, in this preclinical study, we observed that the reductions in blood PCSK9 protein and blood LDL-C levels were durably maintained. As shown in the figures below, at two years following a single intravenous administration of ABE-PCSK9, we observed that the NHPs continued to exhibit an average 90% reduction in blood PCSK9 protein and an average 71% reduction in blood LDL-C.
 
Turnover of mature hepatocytes in the liver is estimated to occur on average every 200 to 300 days. The source of new hepatocytes is not certain, but evidence suggests that mature hepatocytes are responsible for production of new hepatocytes during both homeostatic liver turnover and following liver injury. Less likely, a fraction of hepatocytes with greater regenerative capacity may exist in the liver. In either case, the durability data shown above in our preclinical studies with an ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation suggest that the liver cells responsible for regeneration are edited at the PCSK9 gene site. In addition, we have not observed evidence of persistent inflammation or liver injury that might suggest more rapid hepatocyte turnover or immune-mediated clearance of edited hepatocytes.

We have explored the pharmacodynamics of liver editing and consequent effect on blood PCSK9 protein levels across a large number of iterative NHP studies. We have identified a linear relationship between editing of the PCSK9 gene in liver cells and blood PCSK9 protein levels. The figure below shows a best-fit line with confidence intervals representing a large number of data points from individual NHPs. In NHPs, we have achieved a reduction of greater than 60% in PCSK9 protein with a whole liver editing rate of approximately 50% to 55%. We believe that this relationship between whole liver editing and PCSK9 reduction should be similar in humans.




VERVE-101 preclinical efficacy data
Our preclinical studies of our ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation led to the development of VERVE-101.
Short-term preclinical study of VERVE-101
 In a preclinical dose-response study of VERVE-101 in the figure below, in NHPs, we administered VERVE-101 at four dose levels with three NHPs per dose level. In the figure below each bar represents a different dose group ranging from 0.5 mg/ kg to 3.0 mg/kg. With a dose of 1 mg/kg, we observed whole liver editing levels of approximately 71%, as shown in the figure below, which we believe represents editing of the majority of hepatocytes. We also observed that the level of editing translated into dose-dependent reductions of both blood PCSK9 protein and blood LDL-C. At the 1 mg/kg dose, we observed a PCSK9 protein reduction of approximately 85% and a robust LDL-C reduction of approximately 64%.





We observed that editing occurred quickly following dosing of VERVE-101 in NHPs, with the majority of the editing observed within one to two days of dosing. In the study, NHPs (n=2 per group) were administered the same 1 mg/kg dose, and necropsies were serially performed on day one, day two, day seven, day 14 and day 28. We observed high efficiency editing within 24 hours with minimal additional editing at subsequent time points as shown in the figure below.



The effects on blood PCSK9 protein and LDL-C reached their peak outcomes within two weeks of dosing. The major component of the LNP, the ionizable lipid, is designed to be biodegradable and to be eliminated from the blood within two weeks, and we observed that it was largely eliminated from the liver, to less than 10% of peak concentration, within two weeks of dosing. ABE mRNA levels in the liver decreased by 97% within one week of dosing.

Long-term preclinical study of VERVE-101
 In an ongoing long-term NHP study in 36 NHPs, we administered 1.5 mg/kg of VERVE-101 (n=22) and 0.75 mg/kg (n=4) with a control group (n=10). The study was designed to measure whole liver editing, blood PCSK9 protein levels and blood LDL-C levels. This study utilized our final VERVE-101 drug product that was manufactured at our planned clinical manufacturing site. We plan to continue this study in the dosed NHPs for three or more years.
With a dose of 1.5 mg/kg (n=22), we observed an average of 70% whole liver editing at the PCSK9 target site at day 15, as shown in the figure below, which we believe represents editing of the majority of hepatocytes.
At the 1.5 mg/kg dose, we observed a PCSK9 protein reduction of approximately 79% and a robust LDL-C reduction of approximately 62% at two weeks following treatment, which improved to 89% and 68% at one year following treatment. At a 0.75 mg/kg dose level (n=4), we observed a PCSK9 protein reduction of approximately 54% and a robust LDL-C reduction of approximately 38% at two weeks following treatment, which improved to 69% and 50%, respectively, at one year following treatment.
 
Partial hepatectomy mouse model
 We conducted a durability challenge study in a partial hepatectomy mouse model in order to evaluate whether the level of editing remains following the turnover of liver cells. In this study, a partial hepatectomy that removed two-thirds of the liver or a sham surgery was conducted 11 days after dosing with a mouse surrogate of VERVE-101. In the mice with a partial hepatectomy, the rest of the liver regrows to restore liver weight in approximately nine days. We then performed a necropsy at either 22 days or 95 days post-treatment. We observed sustained editing of PCSK9 in regenerated liver lobes at both 22 days and 95 days post-treatment. We also observed sustained reductions in PCSK9 protein level at both 22 days and 95 days post-treatment. This data supports our belief that as the liver regenerates, the level of editing achieved by VERVE-101 is expected to remain robust and durable.
VERVE-101 biodistribution data
We are using an LNP-based approach to deliver VERVE-101 to the liver. An analysis of the biodistribution of VERVE-101 following administration of a single dose of 1 mg/kg in NHPs indicated that the large majority of editing occurred in the liver in a dose-dependent manner, with lesser rates of editing observed in the spleen and adrenal glands, as shown in the figure below. Other tissues examined showed editing of less than about 2%.




Tolerability of VERVE-101 in NHPs
VERVE-101 was generally well tolerated in NHP studies. We compared treatment with VERVE-101 to a control, or DPBS, at doses of 1 mg/kg or less and observed transient elevations of alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, consistent with mild acute liver injury within one to two days after dosing, which then peaked two to three days after dosing, with average values around 300 U/L following a 1 mg/kg dose. ALT is a commonly used blood marker of liver injury. Within one week of dosing, the average ALT value was within the normal range, indicating recovery, as shown in the figure below. These findings are consistent with observations from nonclinical studies performed for an approved LNP-based product that is administered intravenously.




The liver enzyme findings, which can be monitored with standard clinical laboratory testing, were consistently transient and mild in nature and fully normalized by one to two weeks. We believe that these findings compare favorably to viral vector delivery approaches, which can lead to unpredictable and acute liver injury.
In order to assess the long-term liver safety of VERVE-101, we monitored liver enzymes in a long-term durability study of an ABE-PCSK9 precursor formulation. We did not observe evidence of any ongoing inflammation in the livers of NHPs that had undergone high levels of PCSK9 editing in the liver. In contrast, viral vector delivery can have subacute and chronic liver injury as a result of autoimmune reactions to the viral vector.
In our ongoing long-term preclinical study of VERVE-101, we have not observed any long-term effects on liver function tests, and have only observed mild, transient increases in ALT levels, similar to the study described above. In this study, we also evaluated whether glucose homeostasis may be impacted by systemic PCSK9

inhibition. We have not observed any impact on glucose homeostasis up to one year following administration of VERVE-101.
In a study of 1.5 mg/kg dose of VERVE-101 in six sexually mature male NHPs, we did not observe evidence of germline editing at the PCSK9 site measured in a targeted amplicon assay at 11 weeks following treatment, which is greater than one full cycle of spermatogenesis.
In a study of 436 offspring of female mice treated with the murine surrogate of VERVE-101, genotyping of offspring showed that the PCSK9 gene edit was not transmitted to any of the offspring.
 As LNPs are known to stimulate the immune system, we also assessed a panel of common cytokines following administration of a single dose of VERVE-101 in NHPs. At doses of 1 mg/kg or less, we observed mild and transient activation of certain cytokines, such as IP-10 or MCP-1, compared to control animals. This activation was apparent within 24 hours of dosing and fully resolved by the next observation point at one week. Other cytokines, including TNF-a, did not exhibit any changes above those seen in control animals.
We also assessed complement activation in NHPs that received single administration of VERVE-101. At doses of 1 mg/kg and less, we observed only minimal activation above that in control animals. This minimal activation was detectable approximately two hours after dosing but resolved by 24 hours.
Preclinical off-target editing in NHP
While the human genome is the relevant genome to assess off-target editing, we believe that evaluations of off-target editing in NHPs can support the ability of off-target analysis in primary hepatocytes in vitro to predict off-target editing in the liver when dosed in vivo.
Our approach to the identification of potential off-target sites includes a combination of bioinformatic and in vitro biochemical techniques, including ABE-Digenome-seq and a state-of-the-art technique called ONE-seq. ONE-seq is a comprehensive and sensitive in vitro method to screen for and identify potential sequences where editing may occur. Using ONE-seq, we evaluated the 25,000 sequences in the NHP genome most closely matching the sequence of our on-target site. We prioritized 45 potential sites where editing may occur, of which the PCSK9 target site was identified as the top site.
We then used next-generation DNA sequencing to assess these sites for editing in primary NHP hepatocytes treated with VERVE-101. As shown in the figure below, besides editing at the PCSK9 target site, we did not observe off-target editing at any of the 44 potential off-target sites evaluated, depicted by the purple dots, except for one site designated C5. The C5 site is not present in the human genome.

We then treated NHPs with VERVE-101, took NHP liver samples and sequenced the same sites that we evaluated in primary NHP hepatocytes. In NHP liver samples, we identified off-target editing only at the C5 site. These data support our belief that we have the ability to accurately predict off-target sites in vivo based on off-target analysis in primary hepatocytes in vitro.



Off-target analysis in primary human hepatocytes
 Having established a methodology to connect off-target analysis in cells to in vivo editing, we turned to evaluation of the human genome for VERVE-101. Using two orthogonal techniques – the ONE-seq methodology and ABE-Digenome-seq—we prioritized more than 3,000 potential sites and assessed editing in primary human hepatocytes using a highly sensitive hybrid capture assay. As shown in the figure below, we did not observe any

significant net editing at any of the approximately 3,000 potential off-target sites (black circles) when compared to untreated cells and observed only on-target editing at the PCSK9 target site (purple dot).
In April 2022, we presented data from a comprehensive preclinical assessment of the potential for VERVE-101 to cause unintended, or off-target, DNA edits in primary human liver cells from multiple donors. We used multiple methods consistent with recent guidance from the FDA to identify more than 3,000 sites with the greatest experimental or bioinformatic similarity to the on-target site. We then used a sequencing assay to determine whether administration of VERVE-101 resulted in off-target editing at those sites. We did not observe any statistically significant off-target editing after treatment with VERVE-101 at the identified sites. We also evaluated the potential for off-target editing in non-target cells (spleen cells, adrenal cells, and hematopoietic stem cells) and other cellular contexts (pediatric human liver cells and human liver cell lines) and identified only two sites with statistically significant editing above untreated controls. The two instances of off-target editing occurred at doses greater than the dose we expect to achieve saturation for on-target editing. Based on these assessments, we believe that VERVE-101 has a low risk of off-target genomic modifications that would be expected to have an associated clinical adverse effect.


In addition to the above analyses, we have evaluated for two other theoretical risks: editing of RNA by the base editor and translocations of DNA. In primary human hepatocytes, we did not observe any RNA editing above control or any translocations of DNA.
Preclinical study of multiple doses of VERVE-101
 We are developing VERVE-101 as a single-course gene editing medicine. However, given the complexities of treating patients with ASCVD, we believe that some patients may benefit from additional lipid lowering after treatment with any single agent. We conducted a 90-day preclinical study of VERVE-101 in four NHPs to explore the potential to re-dose patients. In this study, we dosed 0.5 mg/kg of a VERVE-101 precursor on days 1, 30 and 60. We measured editing of PCSK9 by liver biopsy on days 14, 46 and 75, and by liver necropsy on day 90. As shown in the figure below, we observed an increase in PCSK9 editing over the course of the study, with an average of 29% at day 14, 36% at day 46, 53% at day 75 and 59% at day 90. We believe that these data suggest that repeat low doses of a PCSK9 base editor could achieve a high level of liver editing. We did not observe evidence of liver injury following any of the doses.




We believe these data highlight one of the potential key advantages of LNPs as a delivery approach for gene editing medicines.
 Additionally, we have generated data indicating that our proprietary GalNac-LNP can efficiently deliver base editors targeting PCSK9, achieving approximately an 87% reduction in PCSK9 in wild-type NHPs. We are advancing a GalNAc-LNP delivered PCSK9 base editor into preclinical development and believe this data suggests that GalNAc-LNP delivery may have broad utility for liver editing in other indications.
 
heart-1 clinical trial
 The heart-1 clinical trial is designed to enroll approximately 40 adult patients with HeFH who have established ASCVD and evaluate the safety and tolerability of VERVE-101 administration, with additional analyses for pharmacokinetics and reductions in blood PCSK9 protein and LDL-C. The trial includes three parts – (A) a single ascending dose portion, followed by (B) an expansion single-dose cohort, in which additional participants will receive the selected potentially therapeutic dose and (C) an optional second-dose cohort, in which eligible participants in lower dose cohorts in Part A have the option to receive a second treatment at the selected potentially therapeutic dose. During our interactions with regulators in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, country-specific protocols have been developed to account for various modifications to eligibility, design, and conduct in each country.
We have received clearance of our CTAs for VERVE-101 in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and in July 2022, we announced that the first patient had been dosed with VERVE-101 in our heart-1 clinical trial. We have completed dosing of VERVE-101 in the first dose cohort of the dose-escalation portion of the heart-1 clinical trial. Enrollment efforts are ongoing in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We plan to report initial safety and pharmacodynamic data for all dose cohorts of the dose-escalation portion of the heart-1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
 VERVE-101 was recently awarded an Innovation Passport for the treatment of HeFH under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway, or ILAP, by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA. The Innovation Passport designation is the entry point to the ILAP, which aims to accelerate time to market and facilitate patient access to medicines in the United Kingdom for life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions, or conditions for which there is a significant patient or public health need.
 We submitted our IND application to conduct a clinical trial evaluating VERVE-101 in patients with HeFH to the FDA in October 2022 and were subsequently informed by the FDA that our IND application was placed on hold. In December 2022, we received a clinical hold letter from the FDA that outlined the information required to resolve the hold, including additional preclinical data relating to: (i) potency differences between human and non-human cells, (ii) risks of germline editing, and (iii) off-target analyses on non-hepatocyte cell types. Clinical data from the ongoing heart-1 clinical trial in New Zealand and the U.K. were not included in the IND application package submitted to the FDA. In the clinical hold letter, the FDA requested available clinical data from the trial. In addition,

the FDA has requested that we modify the trial protocol in the United States to incorporate additional contraceptive measures and to increase the length of the staggering interval between dosing of participants. We intend to submit our response to the FDA as expeditiously as possible.
 VERVE-201: ANGPTL3 program
VERVE-201, our development candidate targeting ANGPTL3, is designed to permanently turn off the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver. ANGPTL3 is a key regulator of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. We plan to develop this program for the treatment of HoFH, which affects approximately 1,300 people in the United States, as well as for refractory hypercholesterolemia defined as people with ASCVD who are not at LDL-C goal on oral therapy and a PCSK9 inhibitor. Ultimately, we believe that VERVE-201 may also be useful to people at risk for ASCVD as a preventative measure in the general population.
We are conducting preclinical studies to support a regulatory filing for the initiation of clinical development of VERVE-201 and anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in 2024. We plan to utilize internally developed GalNAc-LNP technology in VERVE-201 to deliver a base editor targeting the ANGPTL3 gene to the liver. We have developed proprietary LNPs with a GalNAc ligand designed to bind to ASGPR in the liver, which bypass LDLR, thereby enabling uptake into the liver in HoFH patients.
ANGPTL3 as a target
The ANGPTL3 gene has recently emerged as a new and promising target for severe hyperlipidemia. The ANGPTL3 protein is produced almost exclusively in the liver and released into the blood. It was first identified as a regulator of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism through genetic studies of a naturally occurring strain of mice with low cholesterol, low triglycerides and low circulating fatty acids. The main function of the ANGPTL3 protein is the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme on the surface of blood vessels in the heart, skeletal muscle and fat that is responsible for the breakdown and clearance of circulating triglycerides. ANGPTL3 protein has also been shown to regulate LDL-C by a mechanism that does not depend on LDLR expression, which is in contrast to the mechanism by which PCSK9 regulates LDL-C.
Human genetic studies, conducted by our founders, determined that naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene result in extremely low levels of triglycerides, LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Subsequent studies determined that there were no apparent adverse health consequences observed in patients who naturally lack ANGPTL3 function. Furthermore, individuals completely lacking ANGPTL3 gene function were free from coronary atherosclerotic plaques evaluated by coronary computerized tomography, or CT, scan, compared to matched control family members. Two independent population genetic studies of individuals carrying a single mutated copy of ANGPTL3 demonstrated that partial loss of ANGPTL3 function is protective against ASCVD, with a 34% and 41% lower risk, respectively, compared to individuals without any ANGPTL3 mutations. Collectively, these studies provided strong evidence for ANGPTL3 as a potential therapeutic target for hyperlipidemia and ASCVD risk reduction.
Multiple therapeutic approaches targeting ANGPTL3 have been developed or are being evaluated in the clinic and provide further validation for ANGPTL3 as a target. Evinacumab is a mAb targeting ANGPTL3 that has been shown to effectively lower LDL-C and triglycerides in patients with HoFH and HeFH. The Phase 3 trial for evinacumab in patients with HoFH demonstrated a 49% reduction of LDL-C and a 50% reduction of triglycerides after 24 weeks compared to placebo. Based on these data, evinacumab was approved by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of patients with HoFH.
The LDL-C lowering effect of evinacumab has been demonstrated to be additive to that of PCSK9 inhibition. In a late-stage clinical trial of patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia, due to HeFH in the majority of cases, the addition of evinacumab to a PCSK9 inhibitor further reduced LDL-C by 56% compared to placebo. In addition, other investigational agents targeting ANGPTL3 are being evaluated in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia or CVD, including two different siRNA programs targeting ANGPTL3 from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARO-ANG3) as well as Eli Lilly.


Preclinical studies
In our early preclinical studies, we evaluated multiple LNP formulations with a view to enabling treatment of patients with all forms of FH, as well as multiple editor and gRNA options. In preclinical data generated to date, and discussed below, we have observed the following:
•development of a proprietary GalNAc-targeting ligand that when added to an LNP is capable of delivering a base editor to the liver independent of the LDL receptor status in mice, and which may potentially be used to treat patients with HeFH and HoFH; 
 •proof-of-concept data in NHPs for an ABE-ANGPTL3 precursor formulation demonstrating 60% whole liver editing, 95% reduction in ANGPTL3 and 64% reduction in triglycerides at two weeks after a single treatment; 
 •durability data in NHPs for an ABE-ANGPTL3 precursor formulation demonstrating an ANGPTL3 reduction of 97% and triglyceride reduction of 71% seen at two years following a single treatment; and 
 •proof-of-concept data in an internally developed NHP model of HoFH using a single treatment of two different formulations of our proprietary GalNAc-LNPs to deliver an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor demonstrating approximately 94% (n=3) and 97% (n=3) reduction in blood ANGPTL3 protein, respectively, and reductions in LDL-C of nearly 100 mg/dL, which was an approximately 35% reduction from baseline.
 Discovery and validation of LNPs
Prior to nominating VERVE-201 as a development candidate, we used a rigorous process to optimize preclinical safety and efficacy. We performed a number of studies evaluating precursor formulations of an ANGPTL3 targeted base editor as well as multiple precursor formulations of our proprietary GalNAc-LNPs to deliver the editor.
 LNP-mediated delivery to the liver is more challenging in patients with HoFH than in those with HeFH. This is due to the fact that deficiency in the LDLR gene often drives HoFH pathophysiology, and uptake of LNPs into the liver is generally thought to be through a predominantly LDLR-dependent pathway. An approach to bypass the LDLR would be the addition of a targeting ligand to LNPs that works through a receptor other than LDLR.
We have screened and developed a proprietary GalNAc-targeting ligand that can be incorporated into LNPs. GalNAc ligands bind to the ASGPR in the liver and have been used to enhance delivery of siRNAs to the liver. ASGPR is highly expressed in the liver with rapid turnover in about 15 minutes and high capacity to mediate uptake into the liver independent of LDLR.
We conducted a preclinical study in mice that were entirely deficient in the LDL receptor, or LDLR -/- mice, in order to evaluate the efficacy of our proprietary GalNAc-targeted LNPs. As shown in the graphic below, the addition of the GalNAc ligand onto the LNP increased editing in the liver of LDLR -/- mice. We observed that GalNAc-targeted LNPs have similar apparent potency in wild-type, LDLR +/- mice and LDLR -/- mice.




We are continuing to invest and build out capabilities in the development of novel and optimized GalNAc-targeting ligands, optimal lipid anchors, optimal compositions and ratios of LNP components, and optimal processes of addition and LNP formation with targeting ligands. We believe GalNAc provides a delivery platform for patients with both forms of FH and potentially may be applicable in other applications where liver-directed delivery is advantageous.
NHP model of HoFH
 In order to create a model of HoFH in NHPs, we edited the LDLR gene in wild-type NHPs and eliminated LDLR expression in the liver using a Cas9 and dual guide RNA strategy encapsulated in standard LNPs, which led to nearly 70% whole liver DNA editing at the LDLR gene and resulted in an approximately 94% reduction in LDLR protein in the liver and a six-fold increase in blood LDL-C.
 Validation in an NHP model of HoFH using internally developed GalNAc-LNPs
 Using this novel NHP model of HoFH, we conducted a preclinical study using two different formulations of our proprietary GalNAc-LNPs to deliver an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor. In this study, we observed that delivery of the base editor using standard LNPs did not achieve effective ANGPTL3 editing in the liver of the NHP model of HoFH. As shown in the figures below, in NHPs treated with an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor delivered with a GalNAc-LNP, we observed approximately 94% (n=3) and 97% (n=3) reduction in blood ANGPTL3 protein, and reductions in LDL-C of nearly 100 mg/dL, which was an approximately 35% reduction from baseline.
 



GalNAc-LNP delivery to normal livers of NHPs
 We have also assessed the potential broad utility of our proprietary GalNAc-LNP approach for delivery of an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor, in a preclinical study evaluating delivery efficiency of an ANGPTL3 base editor using both a GalNAc-LNP and a standard LNP without GalNAc in wild-type NHPs with normal livers. In these studies, we observed that wild-type NHPs treated with an ANGPTL3-targeted base editor delivered via our GalNAc-LNP had an approximately 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein compared to an approximately 74% reduction in wild-type NHPs treated with a standard LNP. We believe this suggests that GalNAc-LNP delivery may be utilized in indications where LDLR is present.



We have completed a large confirmatory dose-response study in 34 wild-type NHPs. In this study, we administered an ANGPTL3 base editor using a GalNAc-LNP at 1.5 mg/kg (n=6) and 3.0 mg/kg (n=16) with a control group (n=12). We observed a 96% reduction in circulating ANGPTL3 protein at the 3.0 mg/kg dose group.
NHP validation with ABE-ANGPTL3 precursor formulation
We conducted a preclinical proof-of-concept study using an ABE-ANGPTL3 precursor formulation. In this study, which is ongoing, we administered a single dose to healthy NHPs. In the figure below, each treated NHP is represented by a purple bar and each vehicle treated control is represented by a blue bar. Following a single treatment with our ABE-ANGPTL3 precursor formulation, we observed an average 60% editing of ANGPTL3 in whole liver tissue sampled through a liver biopsy two weeks after dosing. This was accompanied by an average 95% reduction of blood ANGPTL3 protein and an average 64% reduction of blood triglycerides concentrations.
 

Importantly, in this preclinical study, we observed that the reductions in blood ANGPTL3 protein and blood triglycerides levels were durably maintained. As shown in the figure below, at two years following a single intravenous administration of ABE-ANGPTL3, we observed that the NHPs continued to exhibit an average reduction of 97% in blood ANGPTL3 protein and an average reduction of 71% in blood triglycerides.



Our preclinical studies of our ABE-ANGPTL3 precursor formulation as well as precursor formulations of our proprietary GalNAc-LNPs led to the development of VERVE-201.
 
VERVE-201 next steps
 Prior to nominating VERVE-201 as a development candidate, we used a rigorous process designed to optimize preclinical safety and efficacy. We selected an optimized configuration and evaluated VERVE-201 in primary human liver cells, which showed potent, on-target editing of the ANGPTL3 gene with no detectable off-target and no detectable structural variants as assessed using high-coverage whole genome optical mapping. We are conducting preclinical studies to support a regulatory filing for the initiation of clinical development of VERVE-201 and anticipate initiating a Phase 1b clinical trial in 2024.
Sequential dosing
 We believe that patients with very high LDL-C levels or patients with hyperlipidemia that also have high LDL-C levels and high triglyceride levels may benefit from treatment with gene editing medicines that target two lipid pathways, such as PCSK9 and ANGPTL3. We conducted a 90-day preclinical study in four NHPs to assess the potential for sequential dosing of our base editors. In this study, we dosed 1.0 mg/kg of a VERVE-101 precursor on day 1, followed by a 1.0 mg/kg dose of an ANGPTL3 base editor on day 30. As shown in the figure below, we observed a substantial reduction of plasma protein levels of both PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 following sequential dosing. We measured PCSK9 editing by liver biopsy on day 15 and observed an average of 71% editing. We measured ANGPTL3 editing by liver biopsy on day 45 and observed an average of 52% editing. We conducted a liver necropsy on day 90 and observed an average of 69% PCSK9 editing and 63% ANGPTL3 editing. We also monitored plasma PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 protein levels during the study and observed a greater than 90% reduction of plasma PCSK9 protein after the first dose and a greater than 90% reduction of plasma ANGPTL3 protein after the second dose, and observed similar reductions at the end of the study. These data suggest that sequential dosing of a PCSK9 base editor followed by an ANGPTL3 base editor may be able to edit two genes that control two key lipid pathways.
 



Lp(a) Program
 Our Lp(a) program is focused on designing an in vivo genome-editing medicine to durably inactivate the LPA gene in the liver with a precise DNA change. We plan to develop this program initially for patients with ASCVD and high circulating Lp(a) concentrations.
 Lp(a) is a LDL-like particle with apolipoprotein B covalently linked to apolipoprotein(a) that is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood. The LPA gene target was prioritized based on epidemiologic, human genetic, and pharmacologic studies that have established Lp(a) as an important causal and modifiable driver of risk for ASCVD. This increased risk is most pronounced in individuals with very high Lp(a) concentrations (e.g., ≥ 150 nmol/L). An estimated 20% of ASCVD patients have a Lp(a) concentration above this threshold. Lp(a) concentrations are determined almost entirely by inheritance – lifestyle therapies and currently approved lipid-lowering therapies have minimal to no impact.
 Both human genetics and pharmacologic studies have validated the potential efficacy and safety of a Lp(a)-reducing medicine. DNA variants that cause increased circulating Lp(a) are among the strongest inherited drivers of risk for ASCVD as well as certain heart valvular diseases (e.g., aortic stenosis). By contrast, naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in one or both copies of the LPA gene are associated with protection from these conditions and no detectable serious adverse health consequences.
 In addition to these human genetic studies, recent human pharmacologic studies of investigational therapies targeting LPA expression in the liver can potently lower circulating Lp(a) concentrations by greater than 80%. The potential for these medicines to lower the risk of recurrent ASCVD events in patients with high Lp(a) is being tested in ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials of the antisense oligonucleotide pelecarsen and the siRNA olpasiran.
We believe that these prior studies – alongside our experience in developing in vivo genome editing medicines to treat ASCVD – provide substantial evidence for the potential utility of a single-course medicine to lower Lp(a) in a patient population with both high risk and high unmet need. Our Lp(a) program is in the early research stage.
 
Future opportunities
We are investing in the identification of additional in vivo liver gene editing treatments and intend to develop a suite of single-course gene editing medicines that address root causes of disease. We plan to continue to focus on programs where the target has biology substantially validated by human genetics and, in many cases, by clinical development programs using other modalities.

Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and suppliers for critical starting materials, drug substances—gRNA, mRNA—and our drug products. We plan to use third-party CMOs to support our IND-enabling studies and to supply our clinical trials and commercial activities. As we scale manufacturing, we intend to continue to expand and strengthen our network of CMOs. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates, as well as multiple CMOs who could assemble the components of our program candidates.
We are continuing to invest in building internal manufacturing capabilities for mRNA production and LNP formulation, including the development of novel and optimized GalNAc-targeting ligands, lipid anchors, optimal compositions and ratios of LNP components, and optimal processes of addition and LNP formation with targeting ligands. We are also investing in analytical method development including bioactivity and potency assays that will be critical to further product development, batch comparability assessments and additional manufacturing growth.
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements. These regulations govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our CMOs are required to comply with these regulations and are assessed by regular monitoring and formal audits. Our third-party manufacturers are required to manufacture any product candidates we develop under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and other applicable laws and regulations.
We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee our contracted manufacturing and testing activities.
Competition
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally, and the CVD field specifically, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, sharp competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in CVD, gene editing and manufacturing provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates that we develop for the treatment of CVD if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium to competitive generic products.
There are several approved products for LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular risk reduction, such as statins, ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, lomitapide, mipomersen and icosapent ethyl. There are several approved products that target PCSK9 protein as a mechanism to lower LDL-C and reduce the risk of ASCVD. Evolocumab, which is

a mAb marketed as Repatha by Amgen Inc., is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with HeFH, patients with HoFH and patients with ASCVD. Alirocumab, which is a mAb marketed as PRALUENT® by both Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with ASCVD and for the treatment of patients with primary hyperlipidemia, including HeFH. The approved mAb treatments act through extracellular inhibition of the PCSK9 protein. Inclisiran, which is a siRNA marketed as Leqvio® by Novartis, is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with clinical ASCVD or HeFH who require additional lowering of LDL-C and in Europe for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia, including HeFH, or mixed dyslipidemia. Inclisiran acts by inhibiting the synthesis of PCSK9 within liver cells, which is distinct from extracellular protein inhibition. We are also aware of three orally administered small molecule product candidates that target the PCSK9 protein as a mechanism to lower LDL-C and reduce the risk of ASCVD in various stages of clinical development. These include MK-0616 from Merck & Co., Inc, which was studied in a recently completed Phase 2b trial of adult patients with hypercholesterolemia with a plan to release results in the first quarter of 2023; an oral small molecule from Serometrix LLC in-licensed by Esperion Therapeutics, which disclosed plans in 2022 to submit an IND in late 2024 or early 2025; and AZD0780, acquired by AstraZeneca from Dogma Therapeutics, which is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial.
We are aware of two other gene editing programs targeting the PCSK9 gene in preclinical development. Precision Biosciences, Inc., or Precision, has published preclinical data showing long-term stable reduction of PCSK9 and LDL-C levels in NHPs following in vivo gene editing of the PCSK9 gene using its gene editing platform. In September 2021, Precision entered into a collaboration with iECURE under which iECURE plans to advance Precision’s PCSK9 directed nuclease product candidate in to Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of FH in 2022. In January 2023, Precision announced that it had decided to cease pursuit of this program with iECURE as a partner, with plans to provide additional guidance on whether and when this medicine will advance into clinical testing in the future. Additionally, in 2022, CRISPR Therapeutics, or CRISPR, announced CTX330, its research stage in vivo gene editing program targeting PCSK9.
 Evinacumab, which is a mAb targeting ANGPTL3 protein that is marketed by Regeneron, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with HoFH and has additionally been evaluated in Phase 2 studies of patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia and either ASCVD or HeFH, and severe hypertriglyceridemia. We are aware of several product candidates in clinical development that target ANGPTL3 as a mechanism to lower LDL-C and reduce the risk of ASCVD, including ARO-ANG3, a siRNA targeting ANGPTL3 being evaluated by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals in Phase 2 clinical trials of patients with HoFH and patients with mixed dyslipidemia. In 2022, Arrowhead announced plans to initiate pivotal Phase 3 studies of ARO-ANG3 in patients with HoFH and patients with HeFH in the second half of 2023. In addition, Eli Lilly and Company is evaluating a siRNA targeting ANGPTL3 protein in a Phase 2 study in adults with mixed dyslipidemia, and in 2022, CRISPR announced CTX310, its gene editing program targeting ANGPTL3, which is in IND-enabling studies with plans for initial patient dosing in 2023.
 Several investigational medicines designed to reduce Lp(a) are currently in development. These include pelecarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide licensed by Novartis from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in 2019, which is being evaluated in the Phase 3 Lp(a) HORIZON cardiovascular outcomes study in patients with high Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease, with topline results expected in 2025. Olpasiran is an investigational siRNA medicine targeting Lp(a) licensed by Amgen from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, which was recently shown to lower Lp(a) concentrations in patients with established ASCVD and high Lp(a) concentrations. The potential for olpasiran to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with existing ASCVD and high Lp(a) will be evaluated in the OCEAN(a) study, which was initiated in 2022 with plans for study completion in 2026. In addition, SLN360 is an investigational siRNA medicine being developed by Silence Therapeutics plc that is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 study of patients with high Lp(a) concentrations and high risk for ASCVD events, and, in 2022, CRISPR announced CTX320, its research stage in vivo gene editing program targeting Lp(a).
 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our technology.
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know how related to our business, defend and

enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent estate covers various aspects of our programs and technology, including our gene editing programs for PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 targets as well as our RNA delivery and other platform technology. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued or pending would be scheduled to expire on various dates from 2041 through 2043, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other governmental fees. Further details on certain segments of our patent portfolio are included below.
PCSK9 program
With regard to our VERVE-101 program, as of December 31, 2022, our patent estate includes one pending U.S. patent application and over fifteen foreign application counterparts that we own or control and cover various aspects of our VERVE-101 program, including guide RNA sequences targeting the PCSK9 gene, mRNAs encoding adenine base editors, and compositions thereof, methods of using such compositions for therapeutic indications, methods for in vivo gene editing, formulations, dosing regimens, and combination therapies.
ANGPTL3 program
With regard to our VERVE-201 program, as of December 31, 2022, our patent estate includes one pending U.S. patent application, one pending international PCT application and over fifteen foreign application counterparts that we own or control and cover various aspects of our VERVE-201 program, including guide RNA sequences targeting the ANGPTL3 gene, mRNAs encoding adenine base editors, and compositions thereof, methods of using such compositions for therapeutic indications, methods for in vivo gene editing, formulations, dosing regimens, and combination therapies.
License and collaboration agreements
We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. The licensed intellectual property covers, in part, CRISPR-related compositions of matter and their use for base editing. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future.
 
Collaboration and license agreement with Beam Therapeutics
In April 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Beam, or the Original Beam Agreement, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of Beam’s base editing technology, as well as gene editing and delivery technologies to develop, make, use, offer for sale, sell and import base editing products and nuclease products using Beam’s CRISPR associated protein 12b, or Cas12b technology, in each case, directed to any of four gene targets, including the PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 genes, that are associated with an increased risk of coronary diseases, or the licensed products. Upon execution of the Original Beam Agreement and as partial consideration for the rights granted to us thereunder, we issued 276,075 shares of our common stock to Beam.
In July 2022, we amended and restated the Original Beam Agreement upon entering into the Amended and Restated Collaboration and License Agreement with Beam, or the Amended Beam Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended Beam Agreement, Beam granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of Beam’s base editing technology to develop and commercialize products directed towards a third liver-mediated, cardiovascular disease target, in addition to the PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 gene targets licensed under the Original Beam Agreement. We are responsible for the development and commercialization of products targeting the licensed gene targets, in each case subject to Beam’s opt-in right. Except as described below, we are fully responsible for the development of licensed products under the Amended Beam Agreement.


For the ANGPTL3 and PCSK9 gene targets, following the dosing of the final patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of a licensed product for such gene targets, Beam has the right to opt-in to share 33% of worldwide expenses of the development of such licensed product, as well as jointly commercialize and share profits and expenses of commercializing such licensed products in the United States on a 50/50 basis. For the third gene target, following the dosing of the final patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial of a licensed product for such additional gene target, Beam has the right to opt-in to share 35% of worldwide expenses of the development of such licensed product, as well as jointly commercialize and share 35% of the profits and expenses of commercializing such licensed product worldwide.
If Beam exercises its opt-in right for a given licensed product, which we refer to following such opt-in as a collaboration product, it will be obligated to pay for a specified percentage of the development and commercialization costs of such collaboration product and will have the right to receive a specified percentage of the profits from any sales of such collaboration product. With respect to each collaboration product, we and Beam will enter into a subsequent co-promotion agreement prior to the anticipated sale of such collaboration product in the United States, pursuant to which we and Beam will each provide 50% of the promotional effort required to promote the collaboration product. For collaboration products, on a product-by-product basis outside of the United States, we are obligated to pay clinical and regulatory milestones of up to an aggregate of $5.6 million and sales-based milestones of up to an aggregate of $7.5 million.
We refer to any licensed products for which Beam has either (i) not elected to exercise its opt-in right or (ii) if Beam has exercised its opt-in right, either we or Beam subsequently elect to opt-out of the payment of shared development and commercialization costs and participating in the commercialization of such licensed product, as a non-collaboration product. For such non-collaboration products, on a product-by-product basis worldwide, we are obligated to pay clinical and regulatory milestones of up to an aggregate of $11.3 million and sales-based milestones of up to an aggregate of $15.0 million.
To the extent there are sales of a collaboration product outside of the United States or a non-collaboration product worldwide, we will be required to pay tiered royalties to Beam at rates ranging from the low-to-mid single digit percentage of net sales, subject to specified reductions. Such royalty payments will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim under the patent rights covering such product in such country, (ii) the period of regulatory exclusivity associated with such product in such country or (iii) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 We granted to Beam an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, fully paid-up license under our intellectual property, including under our GalNAc-LNP delivery technology, relating to a preclinical program developed by us. Beam has a non-exclusive license under know-how and patents controlled by us, and an interest in joint collaboration technology, to allow Beam to conduct activities under agreed upon research and development plans, as applicable.
 We and Beam each have the right to sublicense our licensed rights, subject to certain restrictions and provided that the sublicense agreement is in compliance and consistent with the terms of the Amended Beam Agreement and any applicable licensed agreements.
The Amended Beam Agreement granted Beam, on a target-by-target basis, the option to obtain a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to our GalNAc-LNP delivery technology for the development and commercialization of certain base editor products, as to which Beam would owe us a fee upon exercise of each option, certain regulatory and commercial sale milestones as well as low single-digit royalties on net sales for base editor products using the GalNAc-LNP delivery technology.
Under the Amended Beam Agreement, Beam controls the prosecution of its respective patent rights, at its sole expense. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to file for, and prosecute and enforce, at our sole expense, product-specific patent rights under the Amended Beam Agreement, to the extent permitted by Beam’s applicable in-license agreements, and we have the exclusive right to file for, prosecute and maintain the patent rights under our delivery technology and any other patent rights that we licensed to Beam under the Amended Beam Agreement.
With respect to intellectual property rights jointly developed by Beam and Verve arising out of a party’s performance of its obligations under the agreement, such intellectual property, depending on its nature, is considered under the agreement as joint collaboration technology and subject to joint ownership by Beam and Verve and we and Beam shall decide in good faith as to who shall bear responsibility for filing for, prosecuting and maintaining the jointly owned patent rights.

The term of the Amended Beam Agreement continues until the last to expire of any royalty term for any licensed product. We have the right to terminate the Amended Beam Agreement as to any licensed product, but not for any collaboration product, by delivering a 90-day termination notice to Beam, provided that Beam has elected not to exercise its opt-in right or the period to exercise such opt-in right has expired. Beam has the right to terminate the Amended Beam Agreement as to certain products by delivering a 90-day termination notice to us. The Amended Beam Agreement may be terminated by either party upon (i) written notice if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period or (ii) the other party’s bankruptcy or liquidation. Beam may terminate the Amended Beam Agreement, and we may terminate the licenses granted to Beam under the Amended Beam Agreement, immediately if the other party, directly or indirectly, challenges the enforceability, validity or scope of any patent rights underlying the licenses granted under the Amended Beam Agreement.
 Acuitas agreements
License agreement for the PCSK9 gene target
In October 2020, we selected an LNP optimized under a development and option agreement with Acuitas, or the Acuitas Development Agreement, to be a component of our VERVE-101 product candidate. In connection with that selection, we exercised an option with respect to the use of the LNP technology and entered into a non-exclusive, worldwide license with Acuitas, or the Acuitas License Agreement, with a right to sub-license through multiple tiers, under the licensed LNP technology to research, develop, have developed, make, have made, keep, use and have used, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import and have imported, export and have exported and otherwise commercialize and exploit licensed products using the LNP technology in connection with the PCSK9 gene target for all human therapeutic or prophylactic uses. Under the Acuitas License Agreement, we are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products.
Acuitas retained the right to prosecute and maintain, at its sole expense, patents related to the LNP technology. In the event that Acuitas elects not to file, prosecute or maintain patents related to the LNP technology, it will notify us and we have the right, but not the obligation, to request that Acuitas continue to file, prosecute or maintain such patents, at our expense, and our license to such patents will automatically become irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid-up and royalty free, but such patents will thereafter no longer be part of the licensed technology in such country.
We and Acuitas will enter into a joint patent prosecution and maintenance agreement with respect to the jointly owned patents under the Acuitas License Agreement and as further provided in the Acuitas Development Agreement.
We paid Acuitas an upfront license fee of $2.0 million (less previously paid target reservation fees) and are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $0.8 million until the achievement of a certain development-based milestone. We are also obligated to reimburse Acuitas quarterly for employee and reasonable external expenses incurred that are related to the transfer of its licensed technology to our CMO.
We are also obligated to pay Acuitas up to an aggregate of $9.8 million in clinical and regulatory milestones and $9.5 million in sales-based milestones. We will be required to pay royalties at a low single digit percentage based on annual net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees. Such royalty payments are subject to reduction if we obtain a license from a third party under technology relating to the LNP technology. Any such royalty payments are payable, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim in the licensed technology that covers the licensed product in such country, (ii) the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period in such country and (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country.
The Acuitas License Agreement will terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the last-to-expire royalty term in such country with respect to such licensed product. We may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement without cause upon prior written notice to Acuitas. Either party may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement upon (i) written notice if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period or (ii) immediately upon notice in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. In lieu of terminating the agreement for Acuitas’ uncured material breach, we have the alternative option, upon written notice to Acuitas, not to terminate the agreement but instead reduce the applicable milestone and royalty payments by a specified percentage.
Novartis license agreement


In October 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis to obtain a non-exclusive license to lipid technology that we are using in connection with the research and development of certain product candidates, including VERVE-201. As consideration for the license and rights granted under the agreement, we made a one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The license agreement requires us to pay up to an aggregate of $10.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestones and $35.0 million in sales-based milestones for products that incorporate the licensed lipid technology.
In June 2022, we amended the agreement to include three additional licensed products to the scope of the non-exclusive license. In consideration of the additional licensed products, we were required to make a one-time, non-refundable upfront payment of $2.8 million to Novartis.
Cas9 license agreement with The Broad Institute and the President and Fellows of Harvard College
In March 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Broad and Harvard for specified patent rights and in December 2019, we entered into an amendment to this license agreement, or, as amended, the Cas9 License Agreement. The licenses granted to us under the Cas9 License Agreement include rights to (i) certain patents and patent applications solely owned by Harvard, or the Harvard Cas9-I Patent Rights, certain patents and patent applications co-owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, and Broad, certain patents and patent applications co-owned by The Rockefeller University, or Rockefeller, and Broad, and certain patents and patent applications co-owned by MIT, Broad and Harvard, which patents and patent applications licensed under the Cas9 License Agreement we refer to as the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights and (ii) certain patents and patent applications co-owned by MIT, Broad, Harvard and the University of Iowa Research Foundation, or Iowa, which patents and patent applications licensed under the Cas9 License Agreement we refer to as the Harvard/Broad Cas9-II Patent Rights, and together with the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights, the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights.
In February 2017, Broad and Rockefeller entered into an inter-institutional agreement pursuant to which Rockefeller authorized Broad to act as its sole and exclusive agent for the purposes of licensing Rockefeller’s rights in such Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights.
In December 2014, as amended in August 2016, MIT, Iowa and Broad entered into a joint invention administration agreement pursuant to which Iowa authorized Broad to act as their sole and exclusive agent for the purposes of licensing their rights in such Harvard/Broad Cas9-II Patent Rights.
License rights under Cas9 License Agreement
Pursuant to the Cas9 License Agreement, Broad and Harvard granted us a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import and export products directed to PCSK9, ANGPTL3 and two additional targets, in the field of the prevention and treatment of human disease, subject to certain limitations and retained rights. With respect to the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights and certain of the Harvard/Broad Cas9-II Patent Rights, or the Cas 9-II Group A Patent Rights, the license is co-exclusive with Editas Medicine, Inc., or Editas. With respect to certain other of the Harvard/Broad Cas9-II Patent Rights, or the Cas9-II Group B Patent Rights, the license is non-exclusive. The license follows the inclusive innovation strategy developed by Broad, MIT and Harvard.
Broad and Harvard also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights for internal research purposes; for research, development and commercialization of products for the prevention or treatment of human disease outside the field of Editas’ exclusive license agreements with Broad and Harvard; and with respect to the targets, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import and export products that are not Cas9 licensed products but is a Cas9 enabled products.
 The licenses granted by Broad and Harvard to us under the Cas9 License Agreement are subject to retained rights of the U.S. government in the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights and the rights retained by Broad, Harvard, MIT, Rockefeller and Iowa on behalf of themselves and other academic, government and non-profit entities, to practice the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights, as applicable, for research, educational or teaching purposes. In addition, certain rights granted to us under the Cas9 License Agreement for the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights are further subject to a non-exclusive license to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for research purposes. Our co-exclusive license rights also are subject to rights retained by Broad, Harvard, MIT, Rockefeller and Iowa, for each of them and for any third party (including non-profit and for-profit entities), to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import or otherwise exploit the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights and licensed products as research products or research tools, or for research purposes.

We have the right to sublicense our licensed rights, subject to certain restrictions and provided that the sublicense agreement must be in compliance and consistent with the terms of the Cas9 License Agreement. Any sublicense agreement cannot include the right to assign sublicenses without the written consent of Broad and Harvard. In addition, any sublicense agreements must contain certain terms, including a provision requiring the sublicensee to indemnify Harvard, Broad, MIT, Rockefeller, Iowa and Howard Hughes Medical Institute according to the same terms as are provided in the Cas9 License Agreement and a statement that Broad, Harvard, MIT, Rockefeller, Iowa and Howard Hughes Medical Institute are intended third-party beneficiaries of the sublicense agreement for certain purposes.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts, or to cause at least one of our affiliates or sublicensees to use commercially reasonable efforts, (i) to research and develop Cas9 licensed products in the licensed field, (ii) to introduce such products in the licensed field into the commercial market, and (iii) to market such products in the licensed field following such introduction into the market and make such products reasonably available to the public. In addition, we, by ourselves or through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, are obligated to achieve certain development milestones within certain time periods. Broad and Harvard have the right to terminate the Cas9 License Agreement if we fail to achieve a development milestone, subject to our right to extend or amend such milestone in accordance with certain procedures. Such termination right will not apply solely with respect to a particular target if, at the time Broad and Harvard elect to terminate the Cas9 License Agreement for failure to achieve a development milestone, we provide evidence reasonably acceptable to Harvard and Broad that we are not in breach of our development milestone diligence obligations with respect to such target and that we are, or one of our affiliates or sublicensees are, (a) researching and developing Cas9 licensed products in the licensed field directed to such target, (b) using commercially reasonable efforts to introduce Cas9 licensed products in the licensed field directed to such target into the commercial market (if applicable), and (c) using commercially reasonable efforts to market Cas9 licensed products in the licensed field directed to such target following such introduction into the market and make such Cas9 licensed products reasonably available to the public (if applicable), and thereafter, for the remainder of the term, we continue, or cause at least one of our affiliates or sublicensees to continue, to develop and commercialize Cas9 licensed products directed to such target in accordance with the foregoing (a)-(c).
Under the Cas9 License Agreement, Broad and Harvard also retained rights to grant further licenses, through its inclusive innovation strategy, under specified circumstances, to third parties, other than specified entities, that wish to develop and commercialize products that target a particular gene outside of the cardiovascular disease field and that otherwise would fall within the scope of our co-exclusive license from Broad and Harvard. If a third party requests a license under the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights for the development and commercialization of a product that would be subject to our co-exclusive license grant from Broad and Harvard under the Cas9 License Agreement, Broad and Harvard may notify us of the request, which we refer to as the Cas9 Third Party Proposed Product Requests. A Cas9 Third Party Proposed Product Request must be accompanied by the third party’s bona fide proposal, including the proposed target or category. Broad may not grant a Cas9 Third Party Proposed Product Request (i) if we, directly or indirectly through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, are researching, developing or commercializing a product directed to the same gene target that is the subject of the Cas9 Third Party Proposed Product Request, or the Cas9 Licensee Product, and we can demonstrate such ongoing efforts to Broad’s reasonable satisfaction, or (ii) if we, directly or indirectly through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, wish to do so, and we can demonstrate to Broad’s reasonable satisfaction that we are interested in researching, developing and commercializing a Cas9 Licensee Product, that we have a commercially reasonable research, development and commercialization plan to do so, and we commence and continue reasonable commercial efforts under such plan. Furthermore, if we, directly or indirectly through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, are not researching, developing or commercializing a Cas9 Licensee Product but wish to grant a sublicense to do so, Broad is obligated to disclose to us the name of the third party and we may enter into a sublicense agreement with the third party. If we, directly or indirectly through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, are not researching, developing or commercializing a Cas9 Licensee Product, are unable to develop and implement a plan reasonably satisfactory to Broad and Harvard, or are unable to enter into a sublicense agreement with the third party, Broad and Harvard have the right to terminate our rights to the specified third-party target or to a specified category and have the right to freely grant to third parties licenses in the licensed field (a) under the patent rights that are exclusively or co-exclusively licensed to us with respect to such specified third party target or (b) under the patent rights that are exclusively or co-exclusively licensed to us within such specified category, provided that such licenses do not grant rights to commercialize products intended for use in the cardiovascular disease field.

Payment terms
Under the Cas9 License Agreement, we paid Broad and Harvard an upfront license fee of $0.1 million and issued an aggregate of 138,037 shares of our common stock to Broad and Harvard. Broad and Harvard also have anti-dilution rights, pursuant to which we (i) have issued Broad and Harvard an aggregate of an additional 309,278 shares of our common stock in the aggregate following the completion of preferred stock financings and (ii) have issued Broad and Harvard an aggregate of an additional 878,098 shares of common stock upon the closing of our IPO.
We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging in dollars from the low- to mid-five figures, depending on the calendar year. A portion of this annual license maintenance fee is creditable against royalties owed on licensed or enabled products in the same year as the maintenance fee is paid.
Broad and Harvard, collectively, are entitled to receive (i) clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $5.7 million per licensed product in the United States, the European Union and Japan for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts fewer than a certain number of patients in the United States and (ii) clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $17.4 million per licensed product in the United States, the European Union and Japan for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a certain number of patients in the United States. If we undergo a change of control during the term of the Cas9 License Agreement, certain of these clinical and regulatory milestone payments will increase by a certain percentage. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Harvard, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales-based milestones per licensed product.
We are also obligated to pay to Broad and Harvard tiered success payments in the event our average market capitalization exceeds specified thresholds ascending from a high nine digit dollar amount to $10.0 billion, or the Market Cap Success Payments, or sale of our company for consideration in excess of those thresholds, or the Company Sale Success Payments, which with the Market Cap Success Payments, we refer to as the Success Payments. Market Cap Success Payments are payable by us in cash, in shares of our common stock, with such shares being valued for such purpose at the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the trading day immediately preceding the date of such payment if our common stock was then listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or a combination of shares and cash. In the event of a change of control of our company or a sale of our company, we are required to pay the related Company Sale Success Payment in cash within a specified period following such event. The Success Payments are cumulative and more than one Success Payment may be due and payable based on the average market capitalization on any trigger date. The maximum aggregate Success Payments that could be payable by us are $31.3 million. Certain of the Success Payments are only payable if a licensed product is or has been evaluated in clinical trials. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such Success Payments, we will be obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of such shares by Broad and Harvard.
In September 2021, we notified Harvard and Broad that our average market capitalization exceeded three specified thresholds as of a relevant measurement date and aggregate success payments of approximately $6.3 million became payable under the Cas9 License Agreement, which we settled in cash in November 2021.
 Broad and Harvard, collectively, are entitled to receive mid single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products, and low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of other products enabled by the license, made by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees. The royalty percentage depends on the aggregate amount of the net sales for the licensed or enabled products. If we are legally required to pay royalties to a third party on net sales of our licensed products because such third party holds patent rights that cover such licensed product, then we can credit, subject to a floor, up to a certain percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to Broad and Harvard in the same period. On a target-by-target basis, if Editas initiates a program that uses technology covered by the Harvard/Broad Cas Patent Rights and is directed to one of the targets, then the milestone and royalty payments for that specific target shall be reduced by a certain percentage. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights that cover the composition, manufacture or use of each covered product in each country or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed or enabled product. If we sublicense any of the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights to a third party, Broad and Harvard, collectively, have the right to receive between 10% and 20% of the sublicense income, which percentage shall decrease to a high single-digit after we meet certain clinical milestones.

Prosecution and enforcement provisions
Broad and Harvard retain control of the prosecution of their respective patent rights. We are obligated to reimburse Broad and Harvard for certain expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the USPTO, any opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection. Broad and Harvard are required to maintain any application or patent within the Harvard/Broad Patents Rights so long as we meet our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses related to prosecution, there is a good faith basis for doing so and doing so is consistent with Broad or Harvard’s patent prosecution strategy. If we cease payment for the prosecution of any Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Right, then any license granted to us with respect to such Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Right will terminate.
We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights with respect to our licensed products so long as certain conditions are met, such as providing Broad and Harvard with evidence demonstrating a good faith basis for bringing suit against a third party and subject to coordination with Editas. We are solely responsible for the costs of any lawsuits we elect to initiate and cannot enter into a settlement without the prior written consent of Broad and Harvard (and MIT, Rockefeller and Iowa, if applicable). Any sums recovered in such lawsuits will be shared among us, Broad and Harvard.

Termination provisions
Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Cas9 License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Harvard/Broad Cas9 Patent Rights. However, our royalty and milestone payment obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the agreement at will upon four months’ written notice to Broad and Harvard. Either we or Broad and Harvard may terminate the agreement upon a specified period of notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. Both Broad and Harvard may terminate the Cas9 License Agreement immediately if we, or our affiliates or sublicensee(s), subject to our ability to cure, challenge the enforceability, validity or scope of any Harvard/Broad Patent Right or assist a third party to do so, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. Neither Broad nor Harvard acting alone has the right to terminate the Cas9 License Agreement. However, Broad and Harvard may separately terminate the licenses granted to us with respect to their respective patent rights upon the occurrence of the same events that would give rise to the right of both institutions acting collectively to terminate the Cas9 License Agreement.
Collaboration and license agreement with Vertex
 On July 18, 2022, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, with Vertex for an exclusive, four-year worldwide research collaboration focused on developing in vivo gene editing candidates toward an undisclosed target for the treatment of a single liver disease. Additionally, on July 18, 2022, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, or the Stock Purchase Agreement, with Vertex, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue shares of our common stock to Vertex in a private placement.
 Pursuant to the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, we will be responsible for discovery, research and certain preclinical development of novel in vivo gene editing development candidates for the target of interest. Our research activities will be focused on (i) identifying and engineering specific gene editing systems and in vivo delivery systems directed to the target and (ii) evaluating and optimizing development candidates to achieve criteria specified in the Vertex Collaboration Agreement. Vertex will reimburse our research expenses consistent with an agreed-upon budget. The research term has an initial term of four years and may be extended by Vertex for up to one additional year.
 Vertex will be solely responsible for subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidate resulting from our research efforts. We received an upfront payment from Vertex of $25 million on July 20, 2022. We are eligible to receive (i) success payments of up to $22 million for each product candidate (up to a maximum of $66 million) that achieves the applicable development criteria and (ii) up to an aggregate of $340 million in development and commercial milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered single-digit royalties on net sales, subject to specified reductions. Such royalty payments will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later to occur of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim under the patent rights covering such product in such country, (ii) the period of regulatory exclusivity associated with such product in such country or (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 Prior to the first patient dosing of the first Phase 1 clinical trial for the first product candidate developed under the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, we also have the right to opt-in to a profit share arrangement pursuant to which

we would share the costs and net profits with Vertex for all product candidates emerging from the collaboration. If we exercise our opt-in right, in lieu of milestones and royalties, we will be obligated to pay for a specified percentage of the development and commercialization costs, and we will have the right to receive a specified percentage of the profits from any sales of any product candidates advanced under the collaboration. At the time we exercise the option, we may elect a profit/cost share of up to 40% (with Vertex retaining a minimum of 60%). In order to exercise our opt-in right, we are required to pay a fee ranging from $25-70 million, depending on the profit/cost percentage elected by us and the licensed technology of Verve included in the most advanced product candidate at the time Verve exercises its opt-in right. Under all profit share scenarios, Vertex will control the worldwide development and commercialization of any product candidates resulting from the collaboration.
 The Vertex Collaboration Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations for a transaction of this nature. We and Vertex each have the right to terminate the agreement for material breach by, or insolvency of, the other party following notice, and if applicable, a cure period. Vertex may also terminate the Vertex Collaboration Agreement in its entirety for convenience upon 90 days’ notice.
 In connection with the execution of the Vertex Collaboration Agreement, we also entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with Vertex for the sale and issuance of 1,519,756 shares of our common stock in a private placement to Vertex at a price of $23.03 per share, which was equal to the five-day volume-weighted average share price as of July 15, 2022, for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million. The private placement closed on July 20, 2022.
 Government regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Licensure and regulation of biologics in the United States
In the United States, any product candidates we may develop would be regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and guidance. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including preclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval process, may subject a sponsor to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.
The FDA must approve a product candidate for a therapeutic indication before it may be marketed in the United States. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products is referred to as a sponsor. A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new biological product in the United States must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:
•preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP regulations; 
 •completion of the manufacture, under cGMP conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing; 
 •design of a clinical protocol and its submission to the FDA as part of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; 


•preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling; 
 •review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the preclinical studies and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP, as applicable, and GCP, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA; 
 •payment of user Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies or other post-marketing commitments required by the FDA. 
 Preclinical studies and investigational new drug application
Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. These studies are typically referred to as IND-enabling studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved new drug application, or NDA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical investigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects. GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.

Additionally, genetic medicine clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, also are potentially subject to review by a committee within the NIH’s Office of Science Policy called the Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee, or the NExTRAC. As of 2019, the charter of this review group has evolved to focus public review on clinical trials that cannot be evaluated by standard oversight bodies and pose unusual risks. With certain genetic medicine protocols, FDA review of or clearance to allow the IND to proceed could be delayed if the NExTRAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted.
Reporting clinical trial results
 Under the PHSA, sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. The NIH’s final rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both the NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
Specifically, the PHSA grants the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the authority to issue a notice of noncompliance to a responsible party for failure to submit clinical trial information as required. The responsible party, however, is allowed 30 days to correct the noncompliance and submit the required information. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is also a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. In addition to civil monetary penalties, violations may also result in other regulatory action, such as injunction and/or criminal prosecution or disqualification from federal grants. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the HHS’s long delay in issuing final implementing regulations, those regulations have now been issued and the FDA has issued several notices of noncompliance since April 2021.
 
Expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, Fast Track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients

can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Human clinical trials in support of a BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from participants. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group may recommend continuation of the trial as planned, changes in trial conduct, or cessation of the trial at designated check points based on certain available data from the trial to which only the DSMB has access.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.
•Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been

submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
 In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. The failure to exercise due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
In December 2022, with the passage of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, action plans must include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.
 Interactions with FDA during the clinical development program
 Following the clearance of an IND and the commencement of clinical trials, the sponsor will continue to have interactions with the FDA. Progress reports detailing the results of clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the occurrence of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. When clinical data is submitted to support marketing applications, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 In addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program. Specifically, sponsors may meet with the FDA prior to the submission of an IND, or pre-IND application meeting, at the end of a Phase 2 clinical trial, or EOP2 meeting, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted, or pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. Meetings at other times may also be requested. There are four types of meetings that occur between sponsors and the FDA. Type A meetings are those that are necessary for an otherwise stalled product development program to proceed or to address an important safety issue. Type B meetings include pre-IND application and pre-NDA/pre-BLA meetings, as well as Type B end of phase meetings, such as EOP2 meetings. A Type C meeting is any meeting other than a Type A or Type B meeting regarding the development and review of a product. Finally, a type D meeting is focused on a narrow set of issues (should be limited to no more than two focused topics) and should not require input from more than three disciplines or divisions.
 These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date with the FDA and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. For example, at an EOP2 meeting, a sponsor may discuss its Phase 2 clinical results and present its plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that it believes will support the approval of the new product. Such meetings may be conducted in person, via teleconference/videoconference or written response only with minutes reflecting the questions that the sponsor posed to the FDA and the FDA’s responses. The FDA has indicated that its responses, as conveyed in meeting minutes and advice letters, only constitute mere recommendations and/or advice made to a sponsor and, as such, sponsors are not bound by such recommendations and/or advice. Nonetheless, from a practical perspective, a sponsor’s failure to follow the FDA’s recommendations for design of a clinical program may put the program at significant risk of failure.


Pediatric studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial pediatric study plan within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The law now requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.
Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although the FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in the PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
 Special regulations and guidance governing gene therapy products
 We expect that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products will be applied to any product candidates we may develop. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient.
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The NIH, including the NExTRAC, also advises the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging biotechnologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for gene therapy INDs, long-term follow-up after the administration of gene therapy products, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders, as well as final guidance in October 2022 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although the FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe for potential delayed adverse effects in participants who have received investigational gene therapies with the duration of follow-up based on the potential for risk of such effects. For AAV vectors specifically, the FDA

typically recommends that sponsors continue to monitor participants for potential gene therapy-related adverse events for up to a 5-year period. Other types of gene therapy or gene editing products may require longer follow up, potentially up to a maximum 15-year period.
 Compliance with cGMP requirements
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that foreign drug manufacturing establishments are subject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug or biologic undergoes further manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing at a separate establishment outside the United States prior to being imported or offered for import into the United States. Inspections must follow a “risk‑based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.
Regulatory requirements governing manufacturing
 The FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product.
Acceptance and review of a BLA
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, safety updates, patent information, abuse information and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug product and the safety, potency and purity of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The fee required for the submission and review of an

application under PDUFA is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2023 this application fee is approximately $3.3 million), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2023 is more than $394,000 per eligible prescription product. These fees, of which the application fee may be waived for products with orphan drug designation, are typically adjusted annually, and exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the sponsor is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor by that time whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, the FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA. In the event that the FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. Typically, an RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information or sections of required information; scientific incompleteness, such as omission of critical data, information or analyses needed to evaluate safety, purity and efficacy or provide adequate directions for use; or inadequate content, presentation, or organization of information such that substantive and meaningful review is precluded. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the filing date for an application with “priority review.” The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date.
 In connection with its review of an application, the FDA will typically submit information requests to the sponsor and set deadlines for responses thereto. The FDA will also conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND applications and GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. With passage of FDORA, Congress clarified the FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspection of facilities involved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to FDA as well as other persons holding study records or involved in the study process. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, a sponsor may incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 Additionally, the FDA may refer an application, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the sponsor during the review process.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the

requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS.
 Decisions on BLAs
 The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The term “substantial evidence” is defined under the FDCA as “evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the product involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the product will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.”
 The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, the FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. This approach was subsequently endorsed by Congress in 1998 with legislation providing, in pertinent part, that “If [FDA] determines, based on relevant science, that data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, FDA may consider such data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence.” This modification to the law recognized the potential for the FDA to find that one adequate and well controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence, including supportive data outside of a controlled trial, is sufficient to establish effectiveness. In December 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance further explaining the studies that are needed to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness. It has not yet finalized that guidance.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a CRL or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product’s safety and efficacy in the NDA or BLA. This assessment is also informed by other factors, including: the severity of the underlying condition and how well patients’ medical needs are addressed by currently available therapies; uncertainty about how the premarket clinical trial evidence will extrapolate to real-world use of the product in the post-market setting; and whether risk management tools are necessary to manage specific risks. In connection with this assessment, the FDA review team will assemble all individual reviews and other documents into an “action package,” which becomes the record for the FDA’s review. The FDA review team then issues a recommendation, and a senior FDA official makes a decision.
 A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six month extension to respond. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA has taken the position that a CRL is not final agency action making the determination subject to judicial review.
 An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population and indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling; post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval; and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.


Under the Ensuring Innovation Act, which was signed into law in April 2021, the FDA must publish action packages summarizing its decisions to approve new drugs and biologics within 30 days of approval of such products. To date, CRLs are not publicly available documents.
 Expedited review programs
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation.
•Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review. 
 •Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review. 
 •Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 With passage of FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated approval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-approval studies to the FDA every six months until the study is completed; and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit. Further, FDORA requires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.
•Regenerative medicine advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 None of these expedited programs changes the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.

Post-approval regulation
If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about a product;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product recall, seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs.
 Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Although healthcare providers may prescribe products for uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, in their professional judgment, drug manufacturers are prohibited from soliciting, encouraging or promoting unapproved uses of a product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations that describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic.


It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act, in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval. Previously, such communications were permitted under FDA guidance but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, including unapproved uses of approved products.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
Finally, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the sponsor may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such trials are conducted, the FDA may not approve any expansion of the labeled indications for use in a timely fashion, or at all. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements that are now assessed as program fees for certain approved drugs.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the

same use. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by the FDA.
In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. On January 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.
 Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of non-patent exclusivity that cover the product are extended by six months.
Regulatory exclusivity governing biologics
When a biological product is licensed for marketing by the FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring the FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the PPACA, was enacted in the United States and included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021. The FDA has also issued numerous guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and licensing biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars under the PHSA, including a draft guidance issued in November 2020 that seeks to provide additional clarity to manufacturers of interchangeable biosimilars.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for a product that is “biosimilar to” a previously approved biological product, which the statute refers to as a “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The biosimilar sponsor may demonstrate that its product is biosimilar to the reference product on the basis of data from analytical studies, animal studies and one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the sponsor must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
 For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find not only that the product is biosimilar to the reference product but also that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product such that the two products may be switched without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. Following approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product,

the FDA may not grant interchangeability status for any second biosimilar until one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar product. In December 2022, Congress clarified through FDORA that the FDA may approve multiple first interchangeable biosimilar biological products so long as the products are all approved on the first day on which such a product is approved as interchangeable with the reference product.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, however, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws that address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
 Patent term restoration and extension
 In the United States, a patent claiming a new biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND application and the submission date of the BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
 Federal and state data privacy and security laws
There are multiple privacy and data security laws that may impact our business activities, in the United States and other countries where we conduct our trials or where we may do business in the future. These laws are evolving and may increase both our obligations and our regulatory risks in the future. In the health care industry generally, under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. HIPAA may apply to us in certain circumstances and may also apply to our business partners in ways that may impact our relationships with them. Our clinical trials will be regulated by HIPAA’s Common Rule, which also includes specific privacy-related provisions. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that may be applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. State attorneys general also have authority to enforce state privacy and security laws. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.
At the state level, California has enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, effective starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA

and the CPRA. The CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and individually identifiable health information. These provisions may apply to some of our business activities. In addition, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, have already passed state privacy laws and other states will likely be considering similar laws in the near future.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any product candidates we may develop, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
FDA approval of companion diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.
The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
In April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance that describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate. This guidance builds upon existing policy regarding the labeling of companion diagnostics. In its 2014 guidance, the FDA stated that if evidence is sufficient to conclude that the companion diagnostic is appropriate for use with a specific group of therapeutic products, the companion diagnostic’s intended use or indications for use should name the specific group of therapeutic products, rather than specific products. The 2020 guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by recommending that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors when determining whether their test could be developed, or the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)).
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require pre-notification marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.

The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2023, the standard fee is $441,547 and the small business fee is $110,387.
 Regulation and procedures governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of an MAA and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical trial approval
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014. That regulation became effective on January 31, 2022, following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System through an independent audit by the European Commission in mid-2020.The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all European Union member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (member states concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned European Union member states. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
PRIME designation in the European Union
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Marketing authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, a sponsor must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union member states (decentralized procedure, national

procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to a sponsor established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, a sponsor must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA.
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
National Authorization Procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union member states, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 •Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, a sponsor may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union member state of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union member state and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The sponsor may choose a European Union member state as the reference member state to lead the scientific evaluation of the application.
 •Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union member state (which acts as the reference member state), in accordance with the national procedures of that member state. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be progressively sought from other European Union member states in a procedure whereby the members concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization produced by the reference European Union member state.
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the European Union member state of the European Economic Area, or the EEA, make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Conditional Approval


In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14–a Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/5 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables sponsors to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the product candidate is intended for the treatment, prevention or medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases; (2) the product candidate is intended to meet unmet medical needs of patients; (3) a marketing authorization may be granted prior to submission of comprehensive clinical data provided that the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required; (4) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, and (5) it is likely that the sponsor will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
 Specialized procedures for gene therapies
The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for gene therapy products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC includes specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Pediatric studies
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, sponsors must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are provided in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
Regulatory data protection in the European Union
In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.

Patent term extensions in the European Union and other jurisdictions
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained, which is described in detail below. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
Periods of authorization and renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the European Union market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.

Regulatory requirements after marketing authorization
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the sponsor must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity.

Pediatric exclusivity
If a sponsor obtains a marketing authorization in all European Union member states, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.
Approval of companion diagnostic devices
In the European Union, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or SPRs, detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745), or MDR, which came into force on May 26, 2021 and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with SPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Conformitè Europëenne mark of conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold. To demonstrate compliance with the SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the European Union for medical devices.
Separately, the regulatory authorities in the European Union also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746), which became effective in May 2022. The new regulation replaces the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC. Manufacturers wishing to apply to a notified body for a conformity assessment of their in vitro diagnostic medical device had until May 2022 to update their technical documentation to meet the requirements and comply with the new, more stringent regulation. The new regulation will, among other things:
 •strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
 •establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
 •improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
 •set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and 
 •strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. 
 
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union took place on January 31, 2020. The European Union and the United Kingdom reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the European Union and the United Kingdom will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the MHRA became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law, the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering the quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit may have a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom. For example, the United Kingdom is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market our product candidates in the

United Kingdom. Until December 31, 2023, it is possible for the MHRA to rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization via the centralized procedure.
Also, notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, by operation of the so-called ‘UK GDPR’ (i.e., the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, as it continues to form part of the law of the United Kingdom by virtue of section 3 of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as subsequently amended) the GDPR continues to apply in substantially equivalent form to processing operations carried out in the context of an establishment in the United Kingdom and any processing relating to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the United Kingdom and/or monitoring of their behavior in the United Kingdom.
However, it is still unclear whether transfers of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under the GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the UK will be treated like a European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR (and transfers of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will require a ‘transfer mechanism’ such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. While the European Commission has published draft adequacy decisions in respect of the United Kingdom, these are subject to further review and it remains to be seen whether or when any such decisions will be adopted. The UK government has already determined that it considers all European Union and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the European Union and EEA remain unaffected. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable European Union member states and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them. Furthermore, in general terms, there will now be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of the data protection law as between the United Kingdom and EEA.

General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment in the EEA and/or regarding the offering of goods or services to, and/or the monitoring of the behavior of individuals in the EEA, including health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. As noted above, by operation of the so-called ‘UK GDPR,’ the GDPR continues to apply in substantially equivalent form in the context of the UK, UK establishments and UK-focused processing operations—so, when we refer to the GDPR in this section, we are also making reference to the UK GDPR in the context of the United Kingdom, unless the context requires otherwise.
The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous, significant and complex requirements on companies that process personal data, such as: requiring the establishment of a legal basis for processing personal data; broadening the definition of personal data (including to capture ‘pseudonymized’ or key-coded data that is commonly processed in a clinical trial-related context); creating obligations for controllers and processors to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; establishing limitations on the retention of personal data; introducing obligations to honor increased rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened standard of data subject consent; establishing obligations to implement certain technical and organizational safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data; introducing obligations to agree to certain specific contractual terms and to take certain measures when working with third-party processors or joint controllers; introducing the obligation to provide notice of certain significant personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the United Kingdom and/or European Union in certain circumstances. In particular, the processing of “special category personal data” (such as personal data related to health and genetic information), which will be relevant to our operations in the context of clinical trials, imposes heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among relevant regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides that EEA member states may introduce specific requirements related to the processing of special categories of personal data such as health data that we may process in connection with clinical trials or otherwise. In the United Kingdom, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 complements the UK GDPR in this regard. More broadly, European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which contributes to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA and/or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised. This fact may lead to greater divergence on the law that applies to the processing of personal data across the EEA and/or United Kingdom, which may increase our costs and overall compliance risk. Such country-specific regulations could also limit our ability to process relevant personal data in the context of our EEA and/or United Kingdom

operations ultimately having an adverse impact on our business, and harming our business and financial condition.
The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside Europe, including to the United States, unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. Certain previously available safeguards have been invalidated, and reliance on alternative safeguards may be complex or not possible in certain circumstances, following a recent ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union and subsequent regulatory guidance. If we are unable to implement a valid solution for personal data transfers from the EEA and United Kingdom, including, for example, obtaining individuals’ explicit consent to transfer their personal data to the United States or other countries, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against transferring personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom. Inability to export personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom may also restrict our activities outside the EEA and United Kingdom; limit our ability to collaborate with partners as well as other service providers, contractors and other companies outside of the EEA and United Kingdom; and/or require us to increase our processing capabilities within the EEA and/or United Kingdom at significant expense or otherwise cause us to change the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations—any or all of which could adversely affect our operations or financial results. Additionally, other countries outside of the EEA and United Kingdom have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business.
The GDPR also provides for more robust regulatory enforcement and permits supervisory authorities to impose greater penalties for violations than under previous European data protection laws, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. In addition to administrative fines, a wide variety of other potential enforcement powers are available to supervisory authorities in respect of potential and suspected violations of the GDPR, including extensive audit and inspection rights, and powers to order temporary or permanent bans on all or some processing of personal data carried out by noncompliant actors. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Additionally, in October 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which would serve as a replacement to the EU-US Privacy Shield. The European Commission initiated the process to adopt an adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework in December 2022. It is unclear if and when the framework will be finalized and whether it will be challenged in court. The uncertainty around this issue may further impact our business operations in the European Union.
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing

approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, any companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to any companion diagnostics.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
If we obtain approval in the future to market in the United States any product candidates we may develop, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare law and regulation
Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and

customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements.
Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid; the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, and, as of 2022, will require applicable manufacturers to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives.
Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions were suspended and reduced through June 2022,with the full 2% cut remaining thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.


Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, the Tax Act repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the PPACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The Trump administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden revoked those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
 Pharmaceutical prices
 The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the prices of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the prices of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, the HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which has been delayed until January 1, 2032 by the Inflation Reduction Act.
 On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The order directs the HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, the HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic pharmaceuticals, and increase transparency; and foster scientific innovation to

promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.
More recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.
Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least nine years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional health care organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
