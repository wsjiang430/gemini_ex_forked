Item 1. Business
Overview
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes a diverse portfolio of essential medicines, including complex generics, injectables, biosimilars and specialty branded pharmaceuticals. We operate principally in the United States, India, and Ireland, and sell to wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, chain pharmacies and individual pharmacies, either directly or indirectly. We are a holding company, whose principal assets are common units (“Amneal Common Units”) of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Amneal”).
The group, together with their affiliates and certain assignees, who owned Amneal when it was a private company (the “Amneal Group”) held 50.1% of Amneal Common Units and the Company held the remaining 49.9% as of December 31, 2022. Although the Company has a minority economic interest in Amneal, it is Amneal’s sole managing member, having the sole voting power to make all of Amneal’s business decisions and control its management. Therefore, the Company consolidates the financial statements of Amneal and its subsidiaries. The Company records non-controlling interests for the portion of Amneal’s economic interests that it does not hold.
Acquisitions
Baclofen Franchise 
On December 30, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with certain entities affiliated with Saol International Limited (collectively, “Saol”), a private specialty pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Saol’s baclofen franchise, including Lioresal®, LYVISPAH™, and a pipeline product under development (the “Saol Acquisition”). The Saol Acquisition expanded our commercial institutional and specialty portfolio in neurology and added commercial infrastructure in advance of our entry into the biosimilar institutional market during October 2022. Consideration for the Saol Acquisition included approximately $84.7 million, paid at closing with cash on hand, and contingent royalty payments based on annual net sales for certain acquired assets, beginning in 2023. The transaction closed on February 9, 2022.
Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. 
On November 2, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (“Puniska”), a privately held manufacturer of parenteral and injectable drugs in India. Upon execution of the agreement, we acquired a 74% controlling interest in the equity of Puniska and acquired the remaining 26% of the equity upon approval of the transaction by the government of India in March 2022.
Kashiv Specialty Pharmaceuticals, LLC
On April 2, 2021, the Company and Kashiv Biosciences, LLC (a related party, refer to Note 24. Related Party Transactions) (“Kashiv”) closed on a transaction for Amneal to acquire a 98% controlling interest in Kashiv Specialty Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“KSP”), a subsidiary of Kashiv focused on the development of innovative drug delivery platforms, novel 505(b)(2) drugs, and complex generics. 
AvKARE, LLC and R&S Northeast LLC
On January 31, 2020, we acquired a 65.1% controlling interest in both AvKARE Inc., a Tennessee corporation, now a limited liability company (“AvKARE, LLC”), and Dixon-Shane, LLC d/b/a R&S Northeast LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company (“R&S”) (collectively, the “Rondo Acquisitions”). AvKARE, LLC is one of the largest private label providers of generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. federal agency sector, primarily focused on serving the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. R&S is a national pharmaceutical wholesaler focused primarily on offering products to 340b-qualified entities to provide consistency in care and pricing. 
For additional information about our acquisitions, refer to Note 3. Acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements. 
Segments of the Business
We have three reportable segments: Generics, Specialty, and AvKARE. 

Generics
Prescription pharmaceutical products are sold either as branded or generic products. Generic pharmaceutical products have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use as patented branded pharmaceutical products, are bioequivalent to the brand it copies, and are usually marketed under their chemical (generic) names rather than brand names. However, generic pharmaceutical products are intended to provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers while maintaining the safety, efficacy, quality and stability of the branded product, and as such are generally sold at prices below their branded equivalents. Typically, a generic pharmaceutical may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless the resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic manufacturers are required to file and receive approval for an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) to market a generic pharmaceutical product. 
Our Generics segment includes over 250 product families covering an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including both immediate and extended release oral solids, powders, liquids, sterile injectables, nasal sprays, inhalation and respiratory products, biosimilar products, ophthalmics, films, transdermal patches and topicals. We focus on developing products that have substantial barriers-to-entry due to complex drug formulations or manufacturing, or legal or regulatory challenges. Focusing on these products allows us the opportunity to offer first-to-file (“FTF”), first-to-market (“FTM”) and other high-value products to customers. A generic pharmaceutical product is considered a FTF product if the ANDA filed with respect to such product is the first to be filed for such product. Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, FTF products may receive a statutory 180-day exclusivity period, subject to certain conditions. A generic product that does not qualify as a FTF may still be a FTM product. A generic product is considered an FTM product if it is the first marketed generic version of a branded pharmaceutical. We define high-value products as products with three or fewer generic competitors at the time of launch. FTF, FTM and high-value products tend to be more profitable and often have longer life cycles than other generic pharmaceuticals. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on our financial results. Market entry by additional competitors generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of our control. Refer to “Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States,” below, for more information.
As of December 31, 2022, our Generics segment had 105 products with a pending ANDA and another 94 products in various stages of development in our pipeline, 61% of which are non-oral solid products. Over half of our generic pipeline consists of what we believe to be potential FTF, FTM and high-value products. We have an integrated, team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities.
Our Generics segment has a growing portfolio of institutional injectable products primarily for the United States hospital market. Our R&D pipeline has prioritized new product innovations in injectables, such as drug/device combinations, peptides, long-acting injectables and large volume parenteral bags. We have expanded our manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure to support the needs of this expanding business with a focus on development, commercialization and scaling a differentiated injectables portfolio. In December 2022, the FDA approved our first ready-to-use large volume bag, an esmolol hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection, which is indicated for tachycardia. 
Additionally, in 2022 we began to commercialize an initial portfolio of oncology biosimilars in the United States. Alymsys®, a biosimilar referencing Avastin®, launched in October 2022, followed by Releuko®, a biosimilar referencing Neupogen®, in November 2022. We plan to launch Flynetra™, a biosimilar referencing Neulasta®, in the first half of 2023. To grow our oncology biosimilars sales, we are focused on serving oncology clinics, integrated health systems and specialty pharmacies. We are focused on expanding our biosimilars portfolio with additional molecules, and we seek to vertically integrate by expanding our biosimilar capabilities.
Our Generics segment had net revenue of $1.43 billion, $1.37 billion and $1.34 billion and operating income of $224.2 million, $281.5 million and $189.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Specialty
Our Specialty segment is engaged in the development, promotion, sale and distribution of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on products addressing central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, and endocrine disorders. Our portfolio of products includes Rytary®, an extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication. In addition to Rytary®, our promoted Specialty portfolio also includes Unithroid® (levothyroxine sodium), for the treatment of hypothyroidism, which is sold under a license and distribution 

agreement with Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Lyvispah® (baclofen), a unique dissolvable granule formulation used to treat muscle stiffness, spasms and pain from multiple sclerosis.
Additionally, we are advancing a pipeline of potential Specialty products, most notably IPX203, a novel, oral formulation of carbidopa/levodopa extended-release capsules for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The FDA accepted our IPX203 NDA and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of June 30, 2023 to complete its evaluation of our IPX203 NDA. Beyond IPX203, we have a pipeline of R&D programs at various stages of development, including 505(b)(2) programs that utilize our propriety drug delivery technology platforms, GRANDE® and KRONOTEC®. GRANDE® is an advanced gastric retention system that enables sustained 12 to 24 hour delivery for drugs with site-specific absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. KRONOTEC® is an advanced osmotic oral drug delivery technology that provides timed, customized and pulsatile drug release to match timing of disease symptoms.
For Specialty products, the majority of such products’ commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the United States (“U.S.”), when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales. 
Our Specialty segment had net sales of $374.1 million, $378.3 million and $355.6 million and operating income of $72.6 million, $56.4 million and $56.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
AvKARE
Our AvKARE segment provides pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical products, and services primarily to governmental agencies, predominantly focused on serving the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs . AvKARE is also a wholesale distributor of bottle and unit dose pharmaceuticals under the registered names of AvKARE and AvPAK, and medical and surgical products. AvKARE is also a packager and wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and vitamins to its retail and institutional customers that are located throughout the U. S. focused primarily on offering 340b-qualified entities products to provide consistency in care and pricing.
Our AvKARE segment had net sales of $406.1 million, $349.0 million and $293.7 million and operating income (loss) of $3.3 million, $6.8 million and $(7.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Geographic Areas
We operate in the U.S., India, and Ireland. During December 2022, we signed a long-term license agreement to commercialize a number of our complex generic products to most parts of Europe as well as in Australia and New Zealand (see Note 5. Alliance and Collaboration to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. See further discussion of this risk in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Sales & Marketing and Customers
In the U.S. and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, we market our Generics and Specialty products primarily through wholesalers and distributors, retail pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and directly into hospitals and institutions. The majority of our generic pharmaceutical products are marketed to large group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) and sold through wholesalers, directly to large chain retailers or to mail order customers. Our sterile injectable products are generally marketed to GPOs and specialty distributors, and sold through wholesalers, and occasionally directly to large hospitals and institutions. All of our wholesalers purchase products and warehouse them for retail drug stores, independent pharmacies and managed care organizations, such as hospitals, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail-order customers. On December 28, 2022, we signed a long-term license agreement to commercialize a number of our complex generic products to most parts of Europe as well as in Australia and New Zealand (see Note 5. Alliance and Collaboration to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold products under this license agreement. Our Specialty segment, which promotes branded pharmaceutical products, employs a team of dedicated field based sales representatives to engage in the direct marketing and promotion of our branded products to physicians and healthcare providers.
In our AvKARE segment, we market our products primarily through wholesalers and distributors, retail pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and directly into hospitals and institutions. The majority of our generic pharmaceutical products within the AvKARE segment are marketed to large GPOs and government entities (U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of 

Veterans Affairs) and sold through wholesalers. The AvKARE segment’s distribution channel primarily sells brand products to clinics, institutions and pharmacies generally marketed to GPOs.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, on a consolidated basis, our four largest customers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Drug Co., Cardinal Health, and CVS Health Corporation, accounted for approximately 71% of our net revenue. In total, we currently have approximately 1,200 customers (including over 1,000 customers specific to our AvKARE segment), some of which are part of large purchasing groups. 
We have no long-term agreements that guarantee future business with any of our major customers and the loss of or substantial reduction in orders from any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, future prospects and financial condition.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is affected by new technologies, new developments, government regulations, health care legislation, availability of financing, and other factors. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, R&D, marketing, and other resources than we do. Competing manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products create value for our customers by offering substitutes for branded pharmaceutical products at significantly lower prices, and at times we may not be able to differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors, successfully formulate and bring to market new products that are less expensive than those of our competitors or offer commercial terms as favorable as those of our competitors. We compete with numerous other companies that currently operate, or intend to operate, in the pharmaceutical industry, including companies that are engaged in the development of controlled-release drug delivery technologies and products, and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake development of such products. Our principal competitors in the generic/biosimilar pharmaceutical products market include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Viatris Inc., Endo International plc, Sandoz International GmbH, Pfizer Inc., Fresenius Kabi KGaA, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Coherus Biosciences, Inc., Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Aurobindo Pharma Limited. Our principal competitors in the specialty pharmaceutical products market include Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC, and Alkermes PLC.
Our AvKARE segment is also highly competitive, with new smaller competitors entering the space regularly. Our competitors are other wholesalers, including Cardinal Health, Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Golden State Medical Supply. 
By focusing on our high-value products with complex dosage forms and high barriers-to-entry, as well as taking advantage of our vertically integrated supply chain and selective use of internal API, we aim to manufacture more profitable products relative to our competition. However, this or any future strategy may not enable us to compete successfully in the generic pharmaceutical industry.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and provided for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for each applicant that is FTF an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification, which signifies a challenge to at least one brand patent. The holder of an approved FTF ANDA that successfully challenges the relevant innovator drug patent(s) usually enjoys higher market share and sales during the 180-day period of exclusivity. When the exclusivity period concludes, other generic competitors may launch their versions of the product, which may cause significant price erosion and loss of market share. In cases where we are the holder of an ANDA for a FTF product, upon the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period, we may adjust the price of such product and provide price adjustments to our customers for the difference between the lower price and the price at which we previously sold the product then held in inventory by our customers. These adjustments are commonly known as shelf stock adjustments. In certain circumstances, we may decide not to provide price adjustments to certain customers and, as a result, we may receive returns of unsold product from these customers and forego future sales volume as opposed to reducing pricing.
Authorized generic pharmaceutical products, which are generic labeled versions of pharmaceutical products introduced by brand companies (directly or through a third-party) under the brand’s NDA, have also increased competition in the generic pharmaceutical industry. Authorized generic pharmaceutical products may be sold prior to, during and subsequent to the 180-day exclusivity period and are a significant source of competition, because brand companies do not face any regulatory barriers to rapidly introducing generic versions of their pharmaceutical products.
Additionally, consolidation among wholesalers and retailers and the formation of GPOs has caused increased price competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The downward price adjustments demanded by distributors of generic pharmaceutical products have reduced revenue and average product gross margin across the industry. Should these price reductions continue or 

even increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin.  Further, even if we reduce the prices we charge our customers, that does not ensure that the prices consumers pay for those drugs will be similarly reduced.  
The main competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include:
•a generic pharmaceutical products manufacturer’s ability to rapidly develop and obtain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities of generic pharmaceutical products;
•the introduction of other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers’ products in direct competition with our products;
•the introduction of authorized generic pharmaceutical products in direct competition with our products;
•consolidation among our customers and the formation of buyer consortia;
•pricing pressures by competitors and customers, even if similar price savings are not passed on to consumers;
•product quality of our generic pharmaceutical competitors;
•our and our competitors’ breadth of product offerings across its portfolio;
•our ability and the ability of our generic pharmaceutical competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or statutory exclusivity periods, limiting the extent and duration of profitability for our products;
•the willingness of our customers to switch their source of supply of products among various generic pharmaceutical competitors;
•the ability of our generic pharmaceutical competitors to identify and market niche products;
•our and our competitors’ level of service (including maintenance of inventories for timely delivery) and reputation as a reliable developer and manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products; and
•product appearance and labeling for our products and those of our competitors.
In the brand-name pharmaceutical market, our principal competitors are pharmaceutical companies that are focused on Parkinson’s disease and other CNS disorders. In addition, with respect to products that we are developing internally and/or any additional products we may in-license from third parties, we expect that we will face increased competition from large pharmaceutical companies, drug delivery companies and other specialty pharmaceutical companies that have focused on the same disorders as our branded products.
Research and Development
R&D activities represent a significant part of our business. R&D expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy, if applicable, and regulatory compliance prior to launch. We are committed to investing in R&D with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our R&D expense was $195.7 million, $201.8 million and $179.9 million, respectively.
Raw Materials
Raw materials, including APIs, essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources. We purchase raw materials from distributors of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals and we also manufacture certain APIs at our facilities in India. In some cases, however, the raw materials used to manufacture our products are available only from a single supplier. Further, even if more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and have done so in the case of our API suppliers for a majority of our products, to list only one supplier in our product applications submitted to the FDA. Generally, we would need as long as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year’s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. Although to date we have only experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such raw materials. Any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases not passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Because legal and regulatory requirements mandate that our product marketing authorizations specify API and raw material suppliers, if a specified supplier were for any reason unable to continue to supply us, we would need to seek FDA approval of a new supplier. The resulting delay in the manufacture and marketing of the impacted pharmaceutical product during the FDA process to qualify and approve the new supplier could, depending on the product, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We protect against the risk of such an event by generally providing for, where feasible, two or more suppliers of raw materials for the pharmaceutical products we manufacture, including those for which we manufacture API in-house. Additionally, we may enter into a contract with a raw material distributor in order to secure adequate supply for specific products.
Manufacturing and Distribution
We have a network of manufacturing sites and co-located R&D centers within the U.S., India and Ireland, with broad dosage capabilities. We also have a distribution center for our Generics and Specialty products in Glasgow, Kentucky and a packaging center in East Hanover, New Jersey. We manufacture the majority of our Generics products internally; of these products, for the year ended December 31, 2022, those manufactured in our U.S. facilities contributed 43% of Generics product net revenue compared to 32% for those manufactured in India. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply products in our Generics portfolio representing approximately 25% of our Generics net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Most of our Specialty products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers. In addition, we selectively manufacture API for a subset of our products, which helps to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing for our products and gives us greater control over our supply chain.
Our AvKARE segment’s distribution centers are located in Fountain Run, Kentucky and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Government Regulation
The business of developing, manufacturing, selling, distributing, and marketing generic and branded products is subject to significant health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the approval and pricing of products, clinical trials, laboratory procedures, privacy and security of health and other sensitive information and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. These regulatory regimes are overseen by governmental bodies, principally the FDA and, as applicable, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and several state and local government or other agencies, including individual data protection authorities, in the U.S. and abroad. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of these governmental agencies may result in legal or other enforcement actions, including suspension of regulatory approval, delays in regulatory approval, clinical holds, orders to cease non-compliant activities and potential civil and criminal actions against us. The regulatory environment, particularly enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly in flux and not always clear. Significant changes in this environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), the Controlled Substances Act, the regulations that implement these laws and other statutes and regulations govern the development, testing, manufacture, packaging, use, distribution, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, marketing, sale, and promotion of our products, as well as post-marketing requirements for safety surveillance and reporting. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in judicial and/or administrative sanctions, such as warning letters, recalls, product seizures, injunctions, fines, total or partial suspension of distribution or production, exclusion or debarment from government programs and contracts, restitution, disgorgement and criminal prosecutions. The FDA has the authority to withdraw its approval of pharmaceuticals at any time, in accordance with its regulatory due process procedures, and can enforce the recall of products.
Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States
In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals and biologics under the FDCA and the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. To market a new drug or biologic, considerable data must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval. In addition to approval, the FDA also regulates research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of drugs and biologics. If we fail to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, we may be subject to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, which could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, delays in approval, suspension or withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, orders to cease non-compliant activities, criminal charges, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement-related letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, exclusion from participation in government programs and contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or other governmental entities. 
Generally, the following types of applications are used to obtain FDA approval.

New Drug Application and Biologics License Application
For a drug product containing an active ingredient not previously approved by the FDA, a prospective manufacturer must submit a complete NDA containing the results of clinical studies supporting the drug product’s safety and efficacy in addition to data and information related to drug product quality and manufacturing. An NDA is also required for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if the drug will be used to treat an indication for which the drug was not previously approved or if the dosage form, strength or method of delivery is changed and requires clinical studies to support the change. A Biologics License Application (“BLA”) is required to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce and market the product for one or more indications. The process required by the FDA before a new pharmaceutical or biological product may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves the steps listed below.
•Laboratory and clinical tests;
•Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application;
•Adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies conducted according to the FDA’s requirements for good clinical practice (“GCP”) and additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its proposed conditions of use;
•For pharmaceutical products, submission of an NDA containing the results of the preclinical tests and clinical studies establishing the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its proposed conditions of use, proposed labeling and extensive data addressing such matters such as drug product quality and manufacturing;
•For biological products, submission of a BLA that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies, as well as information on the chemistry, manufacturing and controls to ensure product identity and quality, and proposed labeling;
•For certain products, development and implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy;
•Scale-up to commercial manufacturing; 
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice; 
•Potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical study sites and the clinical study sponsor that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
•FDA review and approval or licensure of an NDA or of the BLA.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, the sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA and the IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds. Similarly, an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its site if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 studies are designed to assess safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. If favorable, Phase 2 studies are initiated to evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the product’s usefulness. If data from the Phase 2 trials are favorable, large-scale Phase 3 trials are undertaken to confirm the product’s efficacy and safety.
During all phases of clinical development, FDA and others require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators, and certain progress and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with regulatory requirements, the submission of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product is subject to a substantial application user fee, which may be reduced or waived if the FDA finds that certain criteria are met, and there are certain exemptions for products designated for rare diseases or conditions. The submission of an NDA or BLA is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. 

After the application is deemed filed by the FDA, FDA staff will review an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and efficacious for its proposed conditions of use. There can be no assurance that a product will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.
If, after reviewing the NDA or BLA, the FDA determines that the application cannot be approved in its current form, the FDA sends the applicant a Complete Response Letter identifying all outstanding deficiencies that preclude final approval. The FDA then halts its review until the applicant resubmits the NDA or BLA with new information designed to address the deficiencies. An applicant receiving a Complete Response Letter may resubmit the application with data and information addressing the FDA’s concerns or requirements, withdraw the application without prejudice to a subsequent submission of a related application or request a hearing on whether there are grounds for denying approval of the application. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use for which approval had been sought. In addition, the FDA may require an applicant to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market. The agency may also impose requirements that the NDA or BLA holder conduct new studies, make labeling changes, implement Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, and take other corrective measures.
The FDA has a number of programs, including fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review and accelerated approval, intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria, and applicants may explore some of these opportunities for their product candidates, if appropriate. These programs do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Additionally, in the context of public health emergencies, applicants may seek an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) from the FDA, which if granted, allows for the distribution and use of products during the declared public health emergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the EUA, unless the EUA is otherwise terminated.
NDA User Fee Program
On September 30, 2022, the President signed into law the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022, which includes the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA VII”) from fiscal year 2023 through 2027. The program provides for the continued timely review of new NDAs and BLAs. The PDUFA VII enhancements include modernizing the user fee structure, a focus on human resource and financial management improvement including a significant increase in staff capacity and capabilities to support the review of cell and gene therapy products; the creation of capacity planning capability; enhancing use of regulatory tools via benefit-risk, patient-focused drug development, complex innovative trial designs, and model informed drug development; enhancing staffing for breakthrough therapy reviews; focusing on communication with industry; and exploring real world evidence in regulatory decision-making. 
Biosimilar User Fee Program
The Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized for the second time on September 30, 2022 (“BsUFA III”). In the reauthorization of BsUFA III, enhancements include new supplement types and expedited review timelines; enhancing communication and feedback during the biosimilar biological development process; enhancing pre-licensure inspection communication; introducing a new pilot program to enhance regulatory decision-making and facilitate science-based recommendation; and enhancing financial management, transparency, and strategic hiring. 
Abbreviated New Drug Application
For a generic version of an approved drug, an ANDA relies on the FDA’s previous finding of safety and effectiveness for a reference listed drug (“RLD”) and, as a result, may be approved without submission of the same type and extent of information that is requested for a stand-alone new drug application to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. Instead, an ANDA must submit data and information demonstrating the proposed product has the same active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, and strength, and is bioequivalent to the previously approved RLD indicating that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the reference listed drug. For most orally administered pharmaceutical products, bioequivalence between brand and generic is established when there is no statistically significant difference in the rate and extent to which the API in the product is absorbed into the bloodstream. For certain pharmaceutical products, such as topical, locally acting pharmaceutical products, other means 

of establishing bioequivalence may be required by the FDA. The proposed product also must have the same labeling as the RLD with certain limited exceptions, include certain information regarding patents for the RLD, and must meet the same legal and regulatory standards for drug product quality and manufacturing as NDA products.
ANDA User Fee Program
In July 2012, the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (“GDUFA”) were enacted into law. The GDUFA legislation implemented fees for new ANDA applications, Drug Master Files, product and establishment fees and a one-time fee for back-logged ANDA applications pending approval as of October 1, 2012. In return, the program was intended to provide faster and more predictable ANDA reviews by the FDA and increased inspections of drug facilities. On September 30, 2022, it was reauthorized for a second time with provisions that are in effect through September 30, 2027 (“GDUFA III”). The FDA’s commitment letter for GDUFA III, which sets forth performance goals and program enhancements for the reauthorization of GDUFA for fiscal years 2023-2027, sets goals for FDA’s assessment and review of different ANDA submissions and includes enhancements designed to increase pre-submission assessment activities, reduce the number of assessment cycles for ANDAs and facilitate access to generic drugs, in particular for complex products such as those with complex active ingredients or dosage forms that generally are more difficult to genericize and have increased numbers of assessment cycles. The reauthorization also established capacity planning capability.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established the modern regulatory system for generic pharmaceutical products by creating a standardized approach for generic pharmaceutical makers to file ANDAs and receive FDA approval for generic pharmaceutical products. In order to gain FDA approval, there are various regulatory hurdles that a prospective generic manufacturer must clear:
Current Good Manufacturing Practices 
In order to obtain FDA approval for its products, a pharmaceutical manufacturer must demonstrate that its facilities comply with cGMP regulations. The manufacturer is required to comply with cGMP standards at all times during the production and processing of pharmaceuticals, and the FDA may inspect the manufacturer’s sites at any time to ensure compliance.
Patent Provisions
A branded pharmaceutical product is usually protected under patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that allow only the pharmaceutical company that developed the pharmaceutical product to market and sell such product. The sponsor of a branded product must “list” certain patents with the FDA, which in turns publishes that patent information publicly. For a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer to introduce a generic version of a referenced branded pharmaceutical product (its RLD), it must submit to the FDA an ANDA with a certification for each patent listed by the branded product sponsor stating one of the following:
•Paragraph I: That the required patent information relating to the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product has not been filed;
•Paragraph II: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product has expired;
•Paragraph III: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product will expire on a particular date; or
•Paragraph IV: That the patent for the referenced branded pharmaceutical product is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the pharmaceutical product for which approval is being sought.
Filing an ANDA with certifications under Paragraph I or II, referenced above, permits the ANDA to be approved immediately, if it is otherwise eligible. Filing an ANDA with certifications under Paragraph III, referenced above, indicates that the applicant agrees to wait until the relevant patent has expired before seeking final approval of its ANDA. Under Paragraph IV, referenced above, a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer can challenge the patent of the branded referenced pharmaceutical product.
If the ANDA for a generic pharmaceutical product has a Paragraph IV certification, the filer must also notify the NDA and patent holders upon acceptance of the ANDA filing by the FDA (the “PIV Notice”). If in response to notice of a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner initiates a patent infringement action against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving the required notice, approval of the ANDA generally will be stayed for 30 months following receipt of the notice or such shorter or longer time as the court might order.

Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing
The pricing of a generic pharmaceutical product generally correlates to the number of companies manufacturing generic versions of such pharmaceutical product. A generic pharmaceutical product is usually at its highest price immediately after the first generic launch of the product, either because a single manufacturer has been granted 180-day exclusivity or because only a few manufacturers have entered the market due to other technical or operational obstacles to bringing such product to market, such as raw materials shortages or complex formulation. As additional generic manufacturers enter the market, the price of a generic pharmaceutical product typically falls as manufacturers compete on price to capture market share.  Even if we reduce the prices we charge our customers, the prices consumers pay for those drugs may not be similarly reduced.  Additionally, consolidation among wholesalers and retailers and the formation of GPOs has caused increased price competition in the generic pharmaceutical market.
Healthcare Reform
Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. In the U.S., there have recently been multiple federal and state proposals, laws and actions related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other changes to the healthcare system, including the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”). The IRA will permit the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to negotiate maximum fair prices on up to 60 drugs by 2029, starting with 10 drugs in 2026. The drugs must be approved by the FDA for at least seven years (small molecule drugs) or at least eleven years (biologics). The federal government must consider manufacturer-submitted data including R&D costs, production and distribution costs, market data, and revenue and sales volume data. The government must also consider evidence regarding alternative treatments, including whether a drug represents a therapeutic advance compared to existing therapies and the comparative effectiveness of the drug and therapeutic alternatives, including effects on specific populations (e.g., children, elderly, terminally ill). The IRA also requires Medicare Part D plans to limit beneficiaries’ cost-sharing for insulin products, but does not include an insulin cost-sharing cap for commercial plans.
Any significant efforts at the federal or state level to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or by more directly imposing controls on drug pricing, government reimbursement, and access to products could have a material impact on us. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation, limit reimbursement to lower international reference prices, and require deep discounts, could adversely affect our business if implemented. States may also advance drug-pricing initiatives with a focus on affordability review boards, financial penalties related to pricing practices, manufacturer pricing and reporting requirements, as well as regulation of prescription drug assistance or copay accumulator programs in the commercial market. In addition, changes to the Medicaid program or the federal 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could have a material impact on our business. It is unclear what, if any, legislative proposals may be adopted or how governmental bodies and private payors will respond to such healthcare reform. As such, we cannot predict the impact of potential legislation on our business and cannot guarantee that such legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Pharmaceutical Pedigree Laws
Various pharmaceutical pedigree laws, such as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act enacted in 2014, require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription pharmaceutical products from the manufacturer to the dispensary (e.g., pharmacy). Compliance with such laws requires extensive tracking systems and tight coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we believe that we comply with these laws and we intend to do so in the future, such legislation and government enforcement regarding these laws is constantly evolving. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties or loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
Our marketing practices are subject to state laws, as well as federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits corruptly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business. The False Claims Act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services, including to government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. The federal government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare 

providers and healthcare organizations, such as academic teaching hospitals, and the adoption of compliance standards or programs. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.
Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements
Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, generic and brand pharmaceutical companies must file with the DOJ and FTC certain agreements entered into between other brand and/or generic pharmaceutical companies in regards to the settlement of patent litigation and/or the manufacture and marketing of generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products. This requirement impacts the ways in which generic pharmaceutical companies resolve intellectual property litigation and may result in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies and/or additional investigations by the FTC or other governmental organizations.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are subject to the Maximum Allowable Cost Regulations, which limit reimbursements for certain generic prescription drugs under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs to the lowest price at which these drugs are generally available. In many instances, only generic prescription drugs fall within the regulations’ limits. Generally, the pricing and promotion of, method of reimbursement and fixing of reimbursement levels for, and the reporting to federal and state agencies relating to drug products is under active review by federal, state and local governmental entities, as well as by private third-party reimbursors and individuals under whistleblower statutes. At present, the DOJ and U.S. Attorneys Offices and State Attorneys General have initiated investigations, reviews, and litigation into industry-wide pharmaceutical pricing and promotional practices, and whistleblowers have filed qui tam suits. We cannot predict the results of those reviews, investigations, and litigation, or their impact on our business. For further detail, see Note 21. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.
Virtually every state, as well as the District of Columbia, has enacted legislation permitting the substitution of equivalent generic prescription drugs for brand-name drugs where authorized or not prohibited by the prescribing physician, and some states mandate generic substitution in Medicaid programs.
In addition, numerous state and federal requirements exist for a variety of controlled substances, such as narcotics, that may be part of our product formulations. We must meet the requirements of controlled substances laws, such as the Controlled Substances Act, as amended, DEA regulations for certain of our products and activities, and related state requirements. These laws and regulations relate to the manufacture, shipment, storage, security, inventory, recordkeeping, distribution, sale, dispensing, and use of controlled substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the controlled substances used in certain of our current products and products in development. We must annually apply to the DEA and similar governmental and regulatory authorities for procurement quotas in order to obtain these substances. The DEA has authority similar to the FDA’s and may also pursue monetary penalties, administrative penalties such as revocation of a registration to manufacture controlled substances and criminal penalties for controlled substances violations. 
Other federal and state regulatory agencies have far reaching authority. For example, the State of California requires that any manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or other entity in California that sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes certain so called precursor substances must have a permit issued by the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. The substances covered by this requirement include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, among others. The Bureau has authority to issue, suspend and revoke precursor permits, and a permit may be denied, revoked or suspended for various reasons, including (i) failure to maintain effective controls against diversion of precursors to unauthorized persons or entities; (ii) failure to comply with the Health and Safety Code provisions relating to precursor substances, or any regulations adopted thereunder; (iii) commission of any act which would demonstrate actual or potential unfitness to hold a permit in light of the public safety and welfare, which act is substantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of the permit holder; or (iv) if any individual owner, manager, agent, representative or employee of the permit applicant/permit holder willfully violates any federal, state or local criminal statute, rule, or ordinance relating to the manufacture, maintenance, disposal, sale, transfer or furnishing of any precursor substances.
Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulations
Numerous federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations govern the creation, collection, dissemination, receipt, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, creation, processing, and disposal (collectively, “Processing”) of protected health information (“PHI”) and other personal, sensitive, regulated or 

confidential data, including personally identifiable information (“PII”). Many of our activities involve the Processing of PHI and PII.
On the federal level we are subject to a number of sector specific regulations. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, Public Law 116-321, and the regulations that implement these laws (collectively “HIPAA”) impose requirements on covered entities and business associates that address the privacy and security of PHI. In the conduct of our business, we may be either a covered entity or business associate, and we may also be held liable for HIPAA violations by our vendors that are business associates. HIPAA imposes contracting requirements, requires breach notifications, and establishes rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions, including eligibility and claims. Violations of HIPAA may result in enforcement actions, civil and criminal penalties, and settlement, resolution, and monitoring agreements. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents and may negotiate settlements for related cases on behalf of their respective residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation, audit or compliance review regarding our compliance with HIPAA. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action, its standards have been used as a basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in the handling, misuse or breach of PHI. HIPAA does not preempt more stringent state health privacy laws and regulations, which may protect the health information of certain individuals, such as minors, and certain types of sensitive health information, such as transgender care, HIV/AIDS status, reproductive health information, genetic information, and mental and behavioral health. 
Additionally, under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the FTC has jurisdiction over certain privacy and security practices that are deemed unfair and deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce. The FTC has charged companies with violating this act based on failures to appropriately and transparently safeguard personal information, respect consumers’ privacy rights, based on disclosures of health and personal information to third parties, the failure to limit third-party use of health information, the failure to implement policies and procedures to prevent the improper or unauthorized disclosure of health information, and the failure to provide notice and obtain consent before the use and disclosure of health information for advertising. In addition to the FTC Act, the FTC also enforces other federal laws and regulations relating to consumers’ privacy and security. 
The SEC has proposed additional cybersecurity disclosure obligations on reporting companies, with final rulemaking expected this year. 
Over the past several years, the federal government has increasingly focused on the cybersecurity requirements applicable to government contractors, including enhanced guidance and regulation. These include compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement cybersecurity requirements, the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (going into effect over the next four years and based on NIST standards), the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, and the White House’s 2021 Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.
State and local authorities are increasingly focused on protecting individuals from identity theft and a number of states have adopted comprehensive data security laws and regulations requiring, among other things, certain minimum data security standards and security breach notifications that may apply to us in certain circumstances, as well as certain limitations on access to and use of PII. These laws and regulations include state general data breach laws, which exist in all fifty states and protect PII generally. Many states also have their own sector-specific laws regarding the Processing of PII which may apply to us as well. 
In the past few years, five states have adopted their own comprehensive consumer privacy statutes and many more states are considering doing so. Generally, these statutes exempt data and/or entities regulated by HIPAA but are, in varying respects, applicable to other data we collect, such as PII provided by website visitors, and in California, employees and business partners. Additionally, we anticipate federal and state legislators and regulators will continue to enact legislation related to privacy and cybersecurity, including with respect to ransomware incidents.
In addition, international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of PII can be more stringent than those in the United States, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective May 2018, enhanced or created obligations regarding the handling of PII relating to European residents (such as regarding notices, data protection impact assessments and individual rights) and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than the previous European Directive or laws. Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations. In addition, many countries outside of Europe where we conduct business have implemented or may implement data protection laws and regulations, some of which include requirements modeled after those in the GDPR. Some non-U.S. jurisdictions are also 

instituting data residency regulations requiring that data be maintained within the respective jurisdiction or otherwise restricting transfer of personal data across borders unless specified regulatory requirements are met.
Data privacy laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change or interpretive application. Varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of our compliance efforts and violations of applicable data privacy laws can result in significant penalties. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business.
Environmental Laws
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by various environmental regulatory agencies. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and product candidates and have also developed brand names and trademarks for other products and product candidates.
Generally, the branded pharmaceutical business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license.
In the branded pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic or biosimilar versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales, more so for introduction of a generic product as compared to a biosimilar. The rate of this decline also varies by country and by therapeutic category; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have market viability based upon the goodwill of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection.
An innovator product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, the U.S., the European Union and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator’s data to approve a competitor’s generic copy or biosimilar. Regulatory exclusivity rights are also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications, on orphan drugs and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity rights are independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor’s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products with certainty because of the complex interaction 

between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. We cannot assure that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.
In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, we also market products with trademarks. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely.
Seasonality
Consistent with the U.S. pharmaceutical industry trends, the first quarter of each year, excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, is typically our lowest revenue quarter in the year. Certain products within our portfolio are specifically affected by seasonality. For example, sales of oseltamivir correlate with flu seasonality and sales of Adrenaclick® (epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector) correlate with allergy seasonality. The seasonal impact of these particular products may affect a quarterly comparison within any fiscal year.
Human Capital
We lead the Company from a people-first mindset, recognizing that it is our people who generate ideas, operate machinery and deliver success. Since our founding in 2002, we have focused on recruiting, empowering, incentivizing and rewarding employees who are passionately engaged in our mission to “make healthy possible”. In 2022, we elevated our steadfast commitment to these areas in the various ways highlighted below. 
Workforce Demographics and Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,600 employees (“Amneal Employees”), excluding approximately 150 employees in our AvKARE segment. Of the Amneal Employees, approximately 2,400 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 5,200 employees were located outside of the U.S., primarily in India and Ireland. As a global employer, we hired approximately 2,000 Amneal Employees in 2022, and global turnover of those employees was approximately 19%. We regularly monitor our turnover rate and continuously evolve our human capital management strategies to meet Amneal’s needs while also considering the dynamic labor market and increased competition for talent over the past year. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (“DEIB”)
Diversity is essential to our success and is an important element of our human capital management strategy. It starts at the top, with the recent expansion of our Board of Directors diversity via the nomination of an additional, highly qualified, diverse Director in 2022. Further, six out of ten of our executives identified as diverse by race, ethnicity, or gender. More broadly, approximately 72% of our U.S. workforce of Amneal Employees identified as diverse by race or ethnicity and women represented 18% of our global workforce of Amneal Employees. In the U.S., women represented 40% of our workforce and held 31% of leadership roles at the level of Director and above for Amneal Employees. In 2022, we deepened our commitment to equity with the launch of DEIB training to approximately 100 global people leaders and introduced Amneal Women - an Employee Resource Group U.S. pilot program supporting the development of women within the Company.
Programs for Amneal Employees
Workplace Safety and Employee Well-being 
To ensure the health and safety of our employees and patients, we maintained a strategic task force of top leaders to guide our ongoing COVID-19 response. In 2022, we continued to prioritize employee health, safety, and well-being through the appropriate updates to our health and safety protocols aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization guidelines, employee benefits, and continued with hybrid work arrangements where possible. 
The Company’s focus on employee wellness was further amplified in 2022 with the continued expansion of our AmWell Program, powered by Virgin Pulse in the U.S., encompassing free access to four applications offering digital financial wellness, nutrition, fitness, and mental well-being content along with an incentive program to inspire wellness engagement. 
Culture
Our “Rise, Lead, Succeed” culture is central to uniting our global team and serves as a dynamic framework for driving, celebrating and rewarding individual and team performance. Every day, we foster an environment that encourages colleagues to bring their best selves to work and be actively engaged, offer new ideas, and deliver real results. Permeating our culture and day-to-day business operations is a steadfast commitment to ethics and compliance, which is guided by our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, both championed by our executive management team and employees across the Company.
Total Rewards
Our Total Rewards program includes industry competitive benefit, compensation and recognition offerings designed to attract and retain the best and brightest talent. At the heart of our Total Rewards commitment is a broad, flexible and competitive benefits program that enables employees to choose the plans and coverage that meet their personal needs. 
These robust programs, which vary by country, include basic and supplemental health and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, access to a personal health advocate, paid parental leave for birth, adoption or foster placement, family leave, employee assistance programs, travel assistance, tuition reimbursement assistance and retirement savings plans. In addition to our health, wellness and financial benefits, we offer a remote work policy that enables eligible U.S.-based employees the flexibility of a hybrid work schedule of three days onsite and two days remote.
We strongly believe that encouragement and recognition of employee achievement is pivotal to inspiring an engaged and high-performing culture. In 2022, over 3,500 colleagues were recognized by their peers via Amneal Applause, our company’s online and on-the-spot rewards and recognition program. We also continued our global CEO Awards program, which recognized a select group of employees for rising well above and beyond their regular job duties to advance Amneal’s success. Over 75 nominations were submitted, and 12 winners were selected by the executive leadership team and selection committee. 
Our compensation program includes competitive base salaries, annual cash performance-based incentives and each of equity-based long-term incentive awards and cash-based long term incentive awards for eligible employees. Together, these programs play a key role in attracting and retaining key talent as well as rewarding performance and achievement.
Talent Development and Engagement 
We groom employees to continuously elevate their careers by offering opportunities to expand skills through robust experiences, organizational mentoring and a continuously evolving learning and development platform. In 2022, we continued the rollout of the Amneal Leadership Lab program by internalizing instruction via our growing Leaders as Teachers network and introducing 80 additional senior and mid-level leaders to content that bolsters social awareness and better prepares them to navigate the modern challenges and opportunities of our time. The Amneal Leadership Lab curricula included sessions on the following topics: growth mindset, psychological safety, building trust, effective decisions, winning collaborations, communicating with presence, direct conversation and feedback and leading and embracing change. We recognize that taking Amneal to the next level can be accelerated by upskilling all employees to think and act as leaders and requires investment in our people. To help cascade Amneal Leadership Lab principles to all colleagues, we offer access to LinkedIn Learning which also hosts Amneal’s growing library of custom-curated learning paths supporting individual and organization-wide leadership growth. 
Employee Engagement
In 2022, we launched Amneal Listens, an employee listening strategy powered by a reputable third-party tool focused on strengthening engagement. We released our first employee engagement pulse survey to approximately 3,500 of our global employee base. We also leveraged the survey tool to poll our top 200 leaders to assess the strength of our human capital strategies and identify areas for improvement. Going forward, we will continue to expand our Amneal Listens strategy via an annual employee engagement survey as well as various strategically focused ad hoc surveys throughout the year. 
Driving Impact through Corporate Responsibility 
Prioritizing corporate responsibility and environmental sustainability is essential to keeping Amneal resilient and able to meet future challenges and opportunities effectively. These commitments have been embedded in Amneal’s mission to make healthy possible by delivering affordable essential medicines since its founding. Twenty years later, we remain focused on elevating responsibility, prioritizing patients, and considering our impacts on the environment, as well as the environment’s impact on our physical assets, in our decision making. 

In 2021, we built a formal environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) framework and throughout 2022 that framework was elevated through partnership with leaders and teams across the Company, ranging from Employee Health and Safety and Corporate Compliance to Human Resources. Our ESG function continues to guide our environmental, social and governance-related programs as well as ongoing reporting, including the publishing of our annual Corporate Social Responsibility report. Among other highlights, the report details our philanthropic partnerships and the many ways we encourage employees to actively support the vitality of our communities through company-sponsored social and environmental impact opportunities including advocacy, employee volunteerism, fundraising and product donations. Key company commitments have included product donations to longstanding partners including Americares, Dispensary of Hope, and Kingsway Charities. 
In 2022, Amneal became an Americares Emergency Response Partner to help provide the reliable funding base necessary for Americares to respond to disaster events around the globe. To celebrate 20 years of supporting our communities, we also hosted our first global employee give-back day offering hygiene and nutrition kit-building activities for employees in India, Ireland and the U.S. Thanks to our employees’ efforts, we were able to assist nearly 7,000 neighbors in need.
These are just some of our many human capital initiatives. Every year, we aim to review and enhance these and other programs to ensure that we are improving, staying competitive and putting our people at the center of our success.
