(1)In the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold its equity interests in each of MexMar and OVH (as each are defined in “Markets” below) and acquired 100% of the equity interest in SEACOR Marlin LLC, resulting in the Company no longer operating any joint-ventured vessels.
 (2)As of December 31, 2022, 53 of the Company’s owned and leased-in vessels were outfitted with dynamic positioning (“DP”) systems. DP systems enable vessels to maintain a fixed position in close proximity to a rig or platform. The most technologically advanced DP systems have enhanced redundancy in the vessel’s power, electrical, computer and reference systems enabling vessels to maintain accurate position-keeping even in the event of failure of one of those systems (“DP-2”) and, in some cases, in the event of fire and flood (“DP-3”).
 (3)In the second quarter of 2021, the Company removed from service four liftboats. Removed from service vessels are not counted in the active fleet count and therefore not reflected in the above table.
 (4)One owned vessel classified as a CTV - Continuing Operations as of December 31, 2020, was reclassified as a specialty vessel as of January 12, 2021, and then removed from service in the second quarter of 2022. The vessels categorized as CTV - Discontinued Operations in 2020 primarily consisted of the Windcat Workboats CTVs sold in January 2021.
 Platform supply vessels (“PSVs”) generally range from 190 to more than 300 feet in length and are primarily used to deliver general cargo, drilling fluids, bulk products, methanol, diesel fuel and water to rigs and platforms where drilling and work-over activity is underway. These vessels can be modified for a wide variety of other uses and missions, including, but not limited to, construction support (typically when fitted with a crane), standby, security, firefighting, and accommodation. Relevant differentiating features of PSVs are total carrying capacity (expressed as deadweight: “dwt”), available area of clear deck space, below-deck capacity for storage of mud and bulk products used in the drilling process, tank storage for water and fuel oil, accommodation capacity and fuel efficiency. To improve fuel efficiency, reduce carbon and other emissions, and provide greater redundancy, PSVs are sometimes equipped with hybrid battery power systems. As of December 31, 2022, six of the 21 owned PSVs were equipped with hybrid battery power systems. Additional factors in the commercial marketability of PSVs are operating draft because certain markets are limited in the size of vessel that can work safely, local flag preference, cabotage requirements and regulations. To improve station keeping ability, many modern PSVs have DP systems capabilities. As of December 31, 2022, all 21 of the owned PSVs were equipped with DP-2.
Fast support vessels (“FSVs”) are aluminum hull vessels used primarily to move cargo and personnel to and from offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations at greater speeds than traditional steel hull support vessels. FSVs can be catamaran or mono-hull vessels ranging from 145 to 205 feet in length and capable of speeds between 20 to 45 knots with capacities to carry special cargo, support both drilling operations and production services and transport passengers. The Company’s FSV fleet includes vessels that have a passenger capacity of 36 to 150 and, on certain newer FSVs, include reclining seating, ambient lighting and other features to enhance comfort and marketability for passenger transport. FSVs built within the last ten years are sometimes equipped with DP-2 systems, firefighting equipment, hospitals, walk to work and ride control systems for greater comfort and performance. As of December 31, 2022, 21 of the 23 owned and leased-in FSVs were equipped with DP-2 and two were equipped with DP-3. We have been a pioneer in improving the fuel efficiency of FSVs. For instance, our FSV fleet is comprised of vessels with semi-displacement hulls and many of our vessels include Ride Control Technology that optimizes vessel trim and dampens acceleration to reduce fuel consumption. We have also been exploring additional means to cut down on fuel consumption of FSVs, such as through the installation of whole hull ultrasonic antifouling systems. This antifouling technology is currently on 11 of our FSVs.
 Liftboats provide a self-propelled, stable platform to perform offshore wind farm installation and maintenance, production platform construction, inspection, maintenance and removal, well intervention and work-over, well production enhancement, well plug and abandonment, pipeline installation and maintenance and diving operations. The length of jacking legs (235 feet to 335 feet for the Company’s liftboats) determines the water depth in which these vessels can work. Other differentiating features are crane lifting capacity and reach, clear deck area, helipad and electrical generating power and accommodation capacity. Liftboats are used in all of our operating areas. As of December 31, 2022, three of the nine owned liftboats were equipped with DP-2, one with DP-1 and the remaining liftboats were not equipped with DP. Liftboats can support projects while elevated out of the water, shutting down all main engines and relying on one generator during the project, realizing a significant reduction in fuel consumption over vessels that can perform similar missions but that would have to run all engines for the same performance.
 Anchor handling towing supply vessels (“AHTS”) are used primarily to support offshore drilling activities by towing, positioning and mooring drilling rigs and other marine equipment. AHTS are also used to carry and launch equipment such as remote operated vehicles (“ROVs”) used underwater in drilling and well installation, maintenance, and repair and transport supplies and equipment from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations, including floating offshore wind farm installations. The defining characteristics of AHTS are: (i) horsepower (“bhp”); (ii) Bollard pull, which is the pulling capacity of the AHTS and is important for towing and positioning rigs; (iii) winch size in terms of “line pull” and brake holding capacity; and (iv) wire storage capacity. The Company’s fleet of AHTS has varying capabilities and supports offshore mooring activities in water depths ranging from 300 to 8,000 feet. Most modern AHTS are equipped with DP systems and can also carry drilling fluids and bulk products below-deck. As of December 31, 2022, all five of the Company’s owned and leased-in AHTS were equipped with DP-2.
 Specialty vessels include anchor handling tugs, accommodation, line handling and other vessels. These vessels generally have specialized features adapting them to specific applications including offshore maintenance and construction services, freight hauling services and accommodation services. We no longer have specialty vessels in the active fleet.
In addition to its existing fleet, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has a construction project in progress for one U.S.-flag, DP-2 FSV with an uncertain delivery date as the Company, at its option, may defer its construction for an indefinite period of time.
 Markets
 The Company operates its fleet in four principal geographic regions: the United States (“U.S.”), primarily in the Gulf of Mexico; Africa and Europe; the Middle East and Asia; and Latin America, primarily in Mexico and Guyana. The Company’s vessels are highly mobile and regularly and routinely move between countries within a geographic region. In addition, the Company’s vessels are redeployed among its geographic regions, subject to flag restrictions, as changes in market conditions dictate.

The table below sets forth vessel types by geographic market as of December 31 for the indicated years. The Company sometimes participates in joint venture arrangements in certain geographical locations in order to enhance marketing capabilities and facilitate operations in certain foreign markets allowing for the expansion of its fleet and operations while diversifying risks and reducing capital outlays associated with such expansion.

United States, primarily U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 2022, 16 vessels were located in this region, including 12 owned, two leased-in and two managed. The Company’s vessels in this market consist primarily of a fleet of FSVs, PSVs and liftboats that support oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, seasonal construction, decommissioning and diving support operations, as well as the construction and maintenance of offshore wind farms.
 Africa and Europe, continuing operations. As of December 31, 2022, 19 vessels were located in this region, including 18 owned and one leased-in. The Company’s vessels in this market generally support projects for major oil companies primarily in Angola, Nigeria and the North Sea. On January 12, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its Windcat Workboats CTV Business, comprised of 46 CTVs (45 active vessels and one vessel previously removed from service) located in Europe providing crew transfer to offshore wind farms.
 Middle East and Asia. As of December 31, 2022, 16 vessels were located in this region, all of which were owned. The Company’s vessels in this area generally support exploration, personnel transport and seasonal construction activities in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and Israel.
 Latin America. As of December 31, 2022, nine vessels were located in this region, all of which were owned. These vessels consist of a fleet of FSVs and PSVs that provide support for exploration and production activities primarily in Mexico and Guyana. From time to time, the Company’s vessels also work in Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil and Colombia. On September 29, 2022, the Company sold its equity interests in Mantenimiento Express Marítimo, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“MexMar”), and Offshore Vessels Holding, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“OVH”), and acquired 100% of the equity interest in SEACOR Marlin LLC. As a result, the Company no longer operates 19 of the joint-ventured vessels owned by MexMar and OVH, and acquired one previously joint-ventured vessel owned by SEACOR Marlin LLC.

Seasonality
 The demand for the Company’s fleet can fluctuate with weather conditions because maintenance, construction and decommissioning activities are planned during times of the year with more favorable weather conditions. Seasonality is most pronounced for the liftboat fleet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore support vessels in the Europe, Middle East and West Africa, with peak demand normally occurring during the summer months. As a consequence of this seasonality, the Company typically schedules drydockings or other repair and maintenance activity during the winter months.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
 The Company’s principal customers are major integrated national and international oil companies, independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, oil field service and construction companies, as well as offshore wind farm operators and offshore wind farm installation and maintenance companies. For oil and natural gas customers, the volatility of commodity prices and an increased focus on capital discipline (e.g., limiting spending to existing free cash flow and prioritizing returning money to shareholders) limit their field development and production activities which utilize the Company’s services, as these companies continue to focus on increasing or maintaining efficiency, controlling costs and delaying or abandoning exploration activity and facilities with less promise. However, some of our oil and natural gas customers are increasing their capital expenditures in response to higher post-pandemic demand for energy and are increasing their focus on reliable and secure energy sources while maintaining capital discipline. Additionally, increasing offshore wind farm development, particularly in the U.S., has provided opportunities for the Company to work with new customers.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers, ExxonMobil and SEACOR Marine Arabia LLC (“SEACOR Marine Arabia”), a joint venture that is 45% owned by a subsidiary of SEACOR Marine, through which vessels are in service to Saudi Aramco, were each responsible for over 10% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations. ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco were responsible for 18% and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues from continuing operations in 2022. The Company’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 63% of the consolidated revenues from continuing operations in 2022. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
 The Company earns revenue primarily from the time charter and bareboat charter of vessels to customers. Since the Company charges customers based upon daily rates of hire, vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period. Under a time charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel. Under a bareboat charter, the Company provides a vessel to a customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and assumes all risks of operation. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, time charter durations and rates are typically established in the context of master service agreements that govern the terms and conditions of the charter.
 In the Company’s operating areas, contracts or charters vary in length from several days to multi-year periods. Many of the Company’s contracts and charters include cancellation clauses without early termination penalties. As a result of cancellations, options and frequent renewals, the stated duration of charters may not correlate with the length of time the vessel is contracted for to provide services to a particular customer.
 Competitive Conditions
 The market for offshore marine services is highly fragmented and competitive depending upon the region of operation. The most important competitive factors are pricing, availability and specifications of equipment to fit customer requirements. Other important factors include service, reputation, flag preference, local marine operating and regulatory conditions, the ability to provide and maintain logistical support given the complexity of a project and the cost of moving equipment from one geographic region to another.
 The Company has numerous competitors in each of the geographic regions in which it operates, ranging from international companies that operate in many regions to smaller local companies that typically concentrate their activities in one specific country or region.
 Risks of Foreign Operations
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, 72%, 88%, and 89%, respectively, of the Company’s operating revenues from continuing operations and $7.0 million, $15.4 million and ($7.5) million, respectively, of the Company’s equity in earnings (losses) from 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from its foreign operations.
 Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks, which, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. See the risk factors regarding international operations in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Government Regulation
 The Company’s ownership, operation, construction and staffing of vessels is subject to significant regulation under various international, federal, state and local laws, regulations and conventions, including international conventions and ship registry laws of the nations under which the Company’s vessels are flagged, especially with respect to foreign ownership, health, safety, environmental protection and vessel and port security. The following summary is intended to highlight key regulations applicable to the Company’s operations and vessels, and is not intended to be comprehensive.
 The Company does not expect that it will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future to comply with applicable laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international environmental and safety laws and regulations and to comprehensive international conventions, including laws and regulations related to the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters regulated thereunder. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or other sanctions, any of which could be material. However, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations.
 Regulatory Matters
 Most of the vessels operated by the Company are registered in foreign jurisdictions, with the remainder registered in the U.S. Vessels are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership, registration, manning, environmental protection and safety. In addition, the Company’s vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions that are applicable to vessels depending on their jurisdiction of registration. Among the more significant of these conventions are: (i) the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (“MARPOL”); (ii) the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and 1978 Protocols (“SOLAS”); (iii) the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”); (iv) the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the “MLC”); and (v) the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (the “ISPS Code”).
 Domestically registered vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”), the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Maritime Administration (“MARAD”), as well as in certain instances applicable state and local laws. The Company’s operations may be, from time to time, regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) and its Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, and the Company must also periodically certify that its maritime operations adhere to those regulations. These agencies and organizations establish safety requirements and standards and, together with the National Transportation Safety Board (“NTSB”), are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved maritime safety standards. The Company is also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws and regulations that govern the protection of the health and safety of employees.
 The Company is subject to regulation under the Jones Act and related U.S. cabotage laws, which restrict ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade (defined as trade between points in the U.S.), including the transportation of cargo. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S.-flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and be owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Violation of the Jones Act could prohibit operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade during the period of such non-compliance, result in material fines and subject Company vessels to seizure and forfeiture.
 To facilitate compliance with the Jones Act, SEACOR Marine’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws: (i) limit the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of any class of SEACOR Marine’s capital stock (including Common Stock) to 22.5% of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law (presently 25%) but authorize SEACOR Marine’s Board of Directors, under certain circumstances, to increase the foregoing percentage to 24%; (ii) permit the use of a dual stock certification system to help determine such ownership; (iii) provide that any issuance or transfer of shares in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective as against SEACOR Marine and prohibit SEACOR Marine and its transfer agent from registering such purported issuance or transfer of shares or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as a stockholder of SEACOR Marine for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise its remedies; (iv) provide that any such excess shares shall not have any voting or dividend rights; (v) permit SEACOR Marine to redeem any such excess shares; and (vi) permit the Board of Directors of SEACOR Marine to make such reasonable determinations as may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations. In addition, SEACOR Marine’s Third Amended and Restated By-Laws limit the number of non-U.S. citizens that may serve as directors and restrict any non-U.S. citizen officer from acting in the absence or disability of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President of SEACOR Marine. For more information, see SEACOR Marine’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws, which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the “MLC”) establishes comprehensive minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers including, among other things, conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare, and social security protection. The MLC defines seafarer to include all persons engaged in work on a vessel in addition to the vessel’s crew. Under this MLC definition, the Company may be responsible for proving that customer and contractor personnel aboard its vessels have contracts of employment that comply with the MLC requirements. The Company could also be potentially responsible for salaries and/or benefits of third parties that may board one of its vessels. The MLC requires certain vessels that engage in international trade to maintain a valid Maritime Labour Certificate issued by their flag administration. Although the U.S. is not a party to the MLC, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when visiting a port in a country that is a party to the MLC. As part of its safety management system (“SMS”), the Company maintains a fleetwide plan designed to comply with the MLC to the extent applicable to its vessels.
 The hull and machinery of most commercial vessels are classed by an international classification society authorized by its country of registry and subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies. The international classification society certifies that a vessel is maintained in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Certain of the Company's vessels are subject to the periodic inspection, survey, drydocking and maintenance requirements of the USCG, the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and other marine classification societies.
 Under provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and Chapter 563 of Title 46 of the U.S. Code, the Company’s U.S.-flag vessels are subject to requisition, charter or purchase by the U.S. government under certain terms and conditions during a national emergency declared by Presidential Proclamation as described further in the risk factor under the heading “Under certain circumstances, the Company’s vessels are subject to requisition for ownership or use by governmental agencies” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Vessels registered under other flag states may also be subject to requisition or purchase in accordance with applicable local law.
 A wide range of domestic governmental agencies, including the USCG, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety, the BSEE and certain individual states, regulate vessels and other structures in accordance with the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) or analogous state law. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies, which increases the Company’s compliance costs and risk of non-compliance.
 The International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), adopted by the International Maritime Organization (the “IMO”) as an amendment to SOLAS, provides international standards for the safe management and operation of ships and for the prevention of marine pollution from ships. The U.S. enforces the ISM Code for all U.S.-flag vessels and those foreign-flag vessels that call at U.S. ports. All of the Company’s vessels that are 500 or more gross tons are certified as required under the standards set forth in the ISM Code’s safety and pollution protocols. The Company also voluntarily complies with these protocols for some vessels that are under the mandatory 500-gross ton threshold and many of the Company’s customers contractually require compliance with these protocols regardless of the gross tonnage of the vessel. Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to develop an extensive SMS applicable to the vessel and shoreside personnel that includes, among other things, the adoption of a written system of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating their vessels subject to the ISM Code and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The ISM Code also requires a Document of Compliance to be obtained for the vessel manager and a Safety Management Certificate to be obtained for each vessel subject to the ISM Code that it operates or manages. The Company believes that it has complied with these requirements in all material respects.
 Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels, may cause the loss of customers, and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from utilizing U.S. ports.
 Regulatory Compliance
 OPA 90 establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills. OPA 90 applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters of the U.S., and owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels operating in U.S. waters, which include the navigable waters of the U.S. and the 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. (the “EEZ”). For purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility and response planning requirements, OPA 90 differentiates between tank vessels (such as chemical and petroleum product vessels and liquid tank barges) and “other vessels” (such as the Company’s offshore support vessels).
 Under OPA 90, owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or bareboat charterers of vessels are “responsible parties” and may be jointly, severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills up to certain limits of liability as discussed below. Damages are defined broadly to include: (i) injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof; (ii) injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property; (iii) net loss by various governmental bodies of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or profits; (iv) lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage; (v) net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire or other hazards or taking additional safety precautions; and (vi) loss of subsistence use of available natural resources.

OPA 90 limits liability for responsible parties for non-tank vessels, such as the Company’s, to the greater of $1,200 per gross ton or $997,100. These liability limits do not apply (a) if an incident is caused by the responsible party’s violation (or the violation of a person acting pursuant to a contract with the responsible party) of federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or (c) if the responsible party fails or refuses to comply with an order issued under OPA 90.
 OPA 90 requires vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of insurance or qualification as a self-insurer or other evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under OPA 90. In recent years, the Company has satisfied USCG regulations by providing evidence of financial responsibility demonstrated by commercial insurance and self-insurance. OPA 90 regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability for any discharge of hazardous substances, similar to OPA 90, and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million, unless the incident is caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a violation of certain regulations, in which case liability is unlimited.
 Under the Nontank Vessel Response Plan Final Rule issued by the USCG in 2013, owners and operators of nontank vessels are required to prepare Nontank Vessel Response Plans. The Company expects its current pollution liability insurance to cover spill removal costs and damage, subject to coverage deductibles and limitations, including a cap of $1.0 billion. The Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be material adversely affected if the Company incurs spill liability under circumstances in which the Company’s insurance does not provide coverage, the Company’s underwriters fail or refuse to pay a covered claim, or the loss exceeds the Company’s coverage limitations.
 MARPOL is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental discharges. It is implemented in the U.S. pursuant to the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Since the 1990s, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has been aggressively enforcing U.S. criminal laws against vessel owners, operators, managers, crew members, shore side personnel, and corporate officers related to violations of MARPOL. Violations have related to pollution prevention devices, such as the oily-water separator, and include falsifying records, obstructing justice, and making false statements. In certain cases, responsible shipboard officers and shoreside officials have been sentenced to prison. In addition, the DOJ has required most defendants to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance plan (“ECP”) or risk losing the ability to operate in U.S. waters. If the Company is subjected to a DOJ prosecution, it could suffer material adverse effects, including substantial criminal penalties and defense costs, reputational damages and costs associated with the implementation of an ECP.
 The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of “pollutants” into the navigable waters of the U.S. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into navigable waters of the U.S. and the EEZ around the U.S. and imposes civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, thereby exposing the Company to potential liability that is in addition to its exposure arising under OPA 90 and CERCLA.
 The CWA also established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the U.S. Pursuant to the NPDES permitting program, the EPA has issued Vessel General Permits covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations. The EPA issued the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“2013 VGP”) with an initial five-year term. In light of the legislation described below, the 2013 VGP continues to apply to the Company’s U.S.-flag and foreign-flag commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length and operate within the three-mile territorial sea of the U.S. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to “best management practices” to manage the covered discharges that occur normally in the operation of a vessel, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of deficiencies. The Company has filed a Notice of Intent to be covered by the 2013 VGP for each of its ships that operate in U.S. waters.
 On December 4, 2018, the U.S. Congress enacted the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), establishing a new framework for the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operations of vessels. In October of 2020, the EPA published proposed performance standards for vessel incidental discharges and is in the process of promulgating final standards. VIDA requires the USCG to develop implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA’s promulgation of standards. VIDA extends the 2013 VGP’s provisions, leaving them in effect until new regulations are final and enforceable. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the 2013 VGP, including submission of annual reports. The Company can provide no assurance as to when the new regulations and performance standards will be issued, nor can it predict what additional costs it may incur to comply with any such new regulations and performance standards.
 Many countries have ratified and apply the liability scheme adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the “1969 Convention”). Some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol to the 1969 Convention (the “1992 Protocol”). Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo, subject to certain defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances, provided the discharge was not caused by the shipowner’s actual fault or intentional or reckless misconduct.

Vessels trading to countries that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The Company believes that its Protection and Indemnity insurance should cover any liability under these conventions, subject to applicable policy deductibles, exclusions and limitations.
 The U.S. is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol, and thus OPA 90, CERCLA, CWA and other federal and state laws apply in the U.S. as discussed above. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various local legislative and regulatory schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to the 1969 Convention.
 The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001, was adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in the EEZs, of the countries that are party to it. Although the U.S. has not ratified this convention, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally are subject to it when they sail within the territorial waters of those countries that have implemented its provisions. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
 The National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) was enacted in the U.S. in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into U.S. waters through ballast water received in foreign ports. The USCG adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. All new vessels constructed on or after December 1, 2013, regardless of ballast water capacity, must comply with these requirements on delivery from the shipyard absent an extension from the USCG. For non-exempt vessels, ballast water treatment equipment may be required to be used on the vessel. Some U.S. states have enacted legislation or regulations to address the introduction of invasive species through ballast water and hull cleaning management, and permitting requirements, which in many cases have also become part of the state’s 2013 VGP certification. Other states may proceed with the enactment of similar requirements that could increase the Company’s costs of operating in state waters. The Company believes that all of its vessels maintain a ballast water management plan compliant with applicable regulations.
 The IMO ratified the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments, otherwise known as the Ballast Water Management Convention (the “BWM Convention”), effective September 8, 2017. Under the BWM Convention, all ships engaged in international voyages are required to manage their ballast water and sediments under a ship-specific ballast water management plan. The U.S. is not a party to the BWM Convention, but U.S. flagged vessels that undertake international voyages may have to install a USCG/EPA approved ballast water treatment system (“BWTS”) or use one of the other management options under the USCG/EPA ballast water management rules and the BWM Convention to achieve compliance. The Company installs BWTS on its vessels as required by the USCG/EPA and BWM Convention.
 The Endangered Species Act, related regulations and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection may include restrictions on the speed of vessels in certain ocean waters and may require the Company to change the routes of vessels during particular periods.
 The Clean Air Act (as amended, the “CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of various air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), which are designed to attain national health-based air quality standards throughout the U.S., including major metropolitan and industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The EPA and some U.S. states have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from propulsion and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels.
 MARPOL also addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide (“NOx”), from vessels, including a requirement to use low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. Since January 1, 2020, vessels worldwide have been required to use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.5%, which is a reduction from the prior limit of 3.5%. MARPOL also imposes NOx emissions standards on installed marine diesel engines of over 130 kW output power other than those used solely for emergency purposes irrespective of the tonnage of the vessel into which such an engine is installed. The actual NOx limit is determined by a variety of factors, including the vessel’s construction date, the rated speed of the vessel’s engine, and the area in which the vessel is operating.
 More stringent sulfur and NOx requirements apply in certain designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”). There are currently four ECAs worldwide: the Baltic Sea ECA, North Sea ECA, North American ECA, and U.S. Caribbean ECA. As of January 1, 2015, vessels operating in an ECA must burn fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Further, marine diesel engines on vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2016 that are operated in an ECA must meet the stringent NOx standards described above.

The Company’s operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject in the U.S. to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) or comparable state, local or foreign requirements. From time to time the Company arranges for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities. As a general matter, with certain exceptions, vessel owners and operators are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, obtain a generator identification number, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes, and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to disposal facilities. Moreover, vessel owners and operators may be subject to more stringent state hazardous waste requirements. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties with which the Company contracts, the Company could potentially be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.
 MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships. MARPOL defines certain sea areas, such as the “wider Caribbean region” as “special areas” requiring a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea. Applicable MARPOL regulations provide for strict garbage management procedures and documentation requirements for all vessels and fixed and floating platforms. These regulations impose a general prohibition on the discharge of all garbage unless the discharge is expressly provided for under the regulations. The regulations have greatly reduced the amount of garbage that the Company’s vessels are allowed to dispose of at sea.
 Various international conventions and federal, state and local laws and regulations have been considered or implemented to address the environmental effects of emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. At United Nations climate change conferences over the past few decades, various countries have agreed to specific international accords or protocols to establish limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. In December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted pursuant to which member parties agreed to implement national programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, various countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce emissions in an effort to slow global warming. The U.S. signed the Paris Agreement in 2016 and, after withdrawing from it for a short period, remains a signatory thereto. The Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping.
 The IMO has announced its intention to develop limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. The first step toward this goal occurred in October 2016, when the IMO adopted a system for collecting data on ships’ fuel-oil consumption, which will be mandatory and apply globally. In 2020, the IMO proposed amendments to MARPOL that would require vessels to combine a technical and an operational approach to reduce their carbon intensity. The measures are aimed at reducing carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030, compared to 2008.
 For operation within the European Union (“E.U.”), the Company’s vessels need to meet the E.U. Ship Recycling Regulation (“E.U. SRR”) that requires survey and record of Inventory of Hazardous Materials (“IHM”). The Company’s fleet is being impacted by changes to MARPOL and the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (“IBC Code”) which sets out the international standards for the safe carriage, in bulk by sea, of dangerous chemicals and noxious liquid substances (“NLS”). These changes limit the number of dangerous chemicals and NLS cargoes that the Company’s vessels can carry and impose additional requirements that could, in certain instances, functionally preclude their carriage. Any future adoption of climate control treaties, legislation or other regulatory measures by the United Nations, IMO, the E.U., U.S. or other countries where the Company operates that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial and operational impacts on the Company’s business (including potential capital expenditures to reduce such emissions).
The Company manages exposure to losses from the above-described treaties, laws and regulations through its development of appropriate risk management programs, including compliance programs, safety management systems and insurance programs. Although the Company believes these programs mitigate its legal risk, there can be no assurance that these programs will be able to prevent all infractions, nor can the Company provide assurances that future regulations or requirements or any discharge or emission of pollutants by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.
 In addition to the above description of U.S. and E.U. laws and international conventions, the Company’s foreign operations are subject from time to time to similar laws of other countries.
 Security
 The USCG, the IMO, states and local ports continue to adopt heightened security procedures related to ports and vessels.
 To implement certain portions of the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”), the USCG issued regulations in 2003 requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Similarly, in December 2002, the IMO adopted amendments to SOLAS, known as the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (the “ISPS Code”), creating a new chapter dealing specifically with maritime security. The chapter imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities. Included in the various requirements under MTSA and/or the ISPS Code are the following:
 •onboard installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications;
 •onboard installation of ship security alert systems;

•the development of vessel security plans and facility security plans, as applicable;
 •the implementation of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential program in the U.S.; and
 •compliance with flag state security certification requirements.
 The USCG regulations, which are intended to align with international maritime security standards, generally deem foreign-flag vessels to be in compliance with MTSA vessel security measures provided such vessels have onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate that attests to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. However, U.S.-flag vessels that are engaged in international trade must comply with all of the security measures required by MTSA, as well as SOLAS and the ISPS Code.
 In response to these security programs, the Company has implemented security plans and procedures designed to address applicable security standards.
 Industry Hazards and Insurance
 Vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment. Hazards include adverse weather conditions, collisions, fire and mechanical failures, which may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, loss of operating revenues, contamination of cargo, pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs. The Company maintains hull, liability and war risk, general liability, workers compensation and other customary insurance subject to various deductions, exclusions and coverage caps. The Company also conducts training, drills and safety awareness programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize and respond to hazards.
 Employees and Human Capital Management
 On September 17, 2020, the Company announced the formation of a sustainability council to oversee the Company’s enhanced environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) program (the “Sustainability Council”). In conjunction with this announcement, the Sustainability Council published an ESG presentation and launched a new section of the Company’s website to highlight both the Company’s track record of sustainable practices, as well as its future plans to further enhance its ESG efforts. On December 13, 2021, the Sustainability Council published its Inaugural Sustainability Report documenting the Company’s recent achievements in three areas: commitment to employees, environmental impact and responsibility as a global citizen.
 The Sustainability Council is an internal committee that reports to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and includes senior executives, operational heads, and safety and health, compliance, and human resources professionals, led by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Sustainability Council collaborates and drives initiatives on all matters related to sustainability, including, but not limited to environmental protection, clean energy technology, social responsibility, employee, contractor and community engagement, health and safety, and community empowerment. Together with the Board of Directors, the Sustainability Council helps establish sustainability goals and integrate them into strategic and tactical business activities across the Company to contribute to risk management and long-term value for all stakeholders.
 As part of the Company’s ESG efforts and with the assistance of the Sustainability Council, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer has the primary responsibility for developing, managing, and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 1,286 individuals directly and indirectly (through crewing or manning agreements), none of whom are members of a union under the terms of an ongoing agreement. Management considers relations with its employees to be good. The Company believes that its success is driven by its employees, and its human capital strategy focuses on the following key areas:
 Health and Safety: The Company’s health and safety programs, namely its SMS, are implemented to comply with applicable regulations and follow global standards, as well as address the specific hazards of the Company’s various work environments. The Company regularly conducts management reviews, audits, and inspections onboard its vessels and shore side locations to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, policies, and procedures. The Company is also audited annually by an independent classification society to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and standards. The Company utilizes several metrics to assess the performance of its health and safety policies, procedures, and initiatives, including pollution incidents, lost time incidents, medical incidents, and fatalities. In fiscal year 2022, the Company worked over 5.9 million man-hours across its global businesses, and recorded zero pollution incidents, five medical incidents, and a total recordable incident rate of 0.202.

COVID-19 Health Measures: The health and safety of the Company’s employees is its highest priority. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has conducted regular management meetings and implemented several changes to enhance COVID-19 safety and to mitigate related work environment health risks, as well as risks caused by different pathogens. For the Company’s offshore operations, these changes included providing personal protective equipment and implementing COVID-19 vessel response plans across its global fleet which included quarterly fleet-wide shoreside pandemic illness drills and additional onboard illness drills, as well as developed a health screening questionnaire and related guidelines. SEACOR Marine is also installing hydroxyl generators in vessel heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems primarily to destroy pathogens, viruses and bacteria on surfaces and in the air. For the Company’s onshore employees, the Company has enhanced remote working capabilities as well as other arrangements. In addition, the Company provided access to short-term counseling for any employees dealing with the stress of COVID-19 or other issues.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: The Company recognizes the value of diversity, equity and inclusion within its organization and strives to ensure that its workplace reflects the diverse communities in which it operates in order to promote collaboration, innovation, creativity and belonging. The Sustainability Council has been mandated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to develop strategies to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace and oversees the Company’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which is responsible for developing policies and practices to recruit, support, promote and retain staff with diverse backgrounds, experiences and attributes.
The Company is proud of its diverse workforce and cross-cultural competences and, as of December 31, 2022, employed individuals from over 37 countries. The Company further recognizes that the maritime industry has traditionally been male dominated, and as a result, the Company is seeking to increase the representation of females by developing practical and innovative strategies. As of December 31, 2022, 30% of SEACOR Marine’s onshore workforce was female, while only a small fraction of its at sea workforce were female seafarers. SEACOR Marine is committed to continuing to recruit and employ qualified candidates regardless of their gender or cultural background or identity.
Training and Talent Development: The Company is committed to the education of its employees and has committed to provide its employees with a variety of learning opportunities, including, but not limited to, leadership training, technical skill development, soft skills development, workplace conduct guidance, and health, safety and security training. The Sustainability Council works collaboratively with SEACOR Marine’s Human Resources department to continually enhance and promote its training programs to attract new talent as well as develop and retain talent within the organization.
 Employee Benefits: The Company believes in the importance of offering its employees competitive salaries and wages, together with comprehensive insurance options. The Company recognizes the importance of comprehensive benefits, including medical, prescription drug, vision, dental, life, disability and flexible spending, employees and their family members are provided with tools and resources to assist in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The Company pays the cost of basic life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short-term and long-term disability for its employees. Additionally, employees may purchase supplemental life, dependent life, and additional long-term disability insurance. Other valuable benefits provided by the Company include life and travel assistance programs, will preparation and a 401(k) plan.
