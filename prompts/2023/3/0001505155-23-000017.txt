Other applications support HR-specific workflows including onboarding, employee management, termination, HR support, and time and expense management.
Through a series of acquisitions and integrations, we have built a diverse family of software applications under the Upland brand. Our total revenue increased from $302.0 million to $317.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a 5% period-over-period growth rate.  Our subscription and support revenue increased from $287.6 million to $297.9 million, from the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a 4% period-over-period growth rate. 
To support continued growth, we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions within our core cloud offerings of complementary technologies and businesses. We expect that this will expand our customer base and market access, resulting in increased benefits of scale. Consistent with our growth strategy, we have made a total of 31 acquisitions in the 11 years ending December 31, 2022.
The operating platform we use to transform acquired companies in order to maintain a consistently high level of operating performance is called UplandOne. This platform consists of six key areas:
•High-Touch Customer Success Program. We have institutionalized a set of unique customer commitments and deliverables we call the Upland Customer Success Program that includes onboarding and training, a dedicated customer success representative, upgraded success plans, virtual user conferences, periodic executive outreach, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and an ongoing customer feedback loop.
•Quality-Focused R&D. Our approach to research and development (R&D) at Upland is straight-forward: prioritize the customer need, leverage a metrics-driven agile approach with visibility and accountability, and deploy up-to-date development systems and processes to ensure quality and security are built into every step of development. In 2022, we announced the creation of our own R&D Center of Excellence in India which we are continuing to grow as we expand our cost-effective offshore product development platform in order to maintain our product competitiveness and expand our total addressable market. 
•Customer-Driven Innovation. Customer feedback is at the heart of the Upland customer experience. New features are added and prioritized in our product roadmaps, and then fine-tuned, based on direct customer input. Requests from our Premier Success Plan customers are given additional priority weighting for new features and minor issue resolution. Product feedback outlets include customer success account management, virtual user conferences, customer advisory boards, and Upland’s online communities.
•Expert Professional Services. Through our Professional Services organization, Upland is committed to delivering the most value from a customer’s Upland investment in the shortest possible time. Once we engage on a project, we dedicate a team to the planning, configuration, integration, launch, administration, and maintenance of the application. 
•Global Support. Upland Global support includes: prioritized issue escalation and resolution; online and phone support; access to a community to share and discuss best practices, support tips, training materials, and custom reports; a knowledge-base with alerts, service recommendations, and troubleshooting content; unlimited case submissions and real-time case updates; and technical support access worldwide. For customers that have more urgent support requirements, Upland Premier Success Plans provide enhanced response times and availability for the most severe support requests.
•Enterprise Cloud Platform. Upland’s products run on an enterprise-class cloud environment - delivering power, reliability, and flexibility. We utilize third-party cloud providers for our cloud-based products and move acquired products to third-party cloud providers in connection with our acquisition integration program. Our applications are scalable and can support large deployments while maintaining high levels of availability, performance and security levels.
Our operating results in a given period can fluctuate based on the mix of subscription and support, perpetual license and professional services revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our subscription and support revenue represented 94%, 95% and 95% of total revenue, respectively. Historically, we have sold certain of our applications under perpetual licenses, which also are paid in advance. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our perpetual license revenue represented 2%, 1% and 1% of total revenue, respectively. The support agreements related to our perpetual licenses are typically one-year in duration and entitle the customer to support and unspecified upgrades. The revenue related to such support agreements is included as part of our subscription and support revenue. Professional services revenue consists of fees related to implementation, data extraction, integration and configuration, and training on our applications. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our professional services revenue represented 4%, 4% and 4% of total revenue, respectively. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths are keys to our success:
•Large, diversified customer base. Our customer base is highly diverse and spans a broad array of industries, including financial services, consulting services, technology, manufacturing, media, telecommunications, government, political, non-profit, healthcare, life sciences, retail and hospitality. We service customers of varying size, ranging from large global corporations and government agencies to medium-sized businesses. We have more than 10,000 customers, with no customer representing more than 10% of our revenue.
•Diversified family of cloud applications. We offer a family of cloud-based software applications that addresses a broad range of enterprise needs. We believe this benefits our customers as compared to many of our cloud-based competitors who offer only a single point solution for a more limited and discrete need. 
•Recurring revenue model with high visibility. We believe we have an attractive operating model due to the recurring nature of our subscription revenue, which results in greater visibility and predictability of future revenue and enhances our ability to effectively manage our business. In addition, the cloud-based nature of our model accommodates significant additional business volume with limited incremental costs, providing us with opportunities to improve our operating margins.
•Proven M&A capability. We have a proven ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate complementary businesses to grow our company, as evidenced by the 31 acquisitions we have completed in the 11 years ending December 31, 2022. We believe that our acquisition experience and strategy give us a competitive advantage in identifying additional opportunities to expand our family of software applications to better serve our customers.
•Experienced, proven management team. Our management team has significant operating experience and previously occupied key leadership roles at both private and public companies. In addition, our management’s extensive knowledge of the industry and experience in building businesses has enabled us to establish a leading position within the enterprise software market.
•Cloud-based delivery. We deliver our software applications and functionality primarily through the cloud, with no hardware or software installation required by our customers. This delivery model allows us to provide reliable, cost-effective applications to our customers, add subscribers with minimal incremental effort and deploy new functionality and upgrades quickly and efficiently. We believe our cloud-based delivery model provides us with a competitive advantage over legacy processes and on-premise systems.
•Commitment to customer success. We have a dedicated customer success organization whose mission is to drive adoption, value realization, retention, and loyalty across our customer base. Our focus on enabling our customers’ success is a key reason our annual net dollar retention rate was 95% as of December 31, 2022. See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis—Key Metrics,” for our definition of annual net dollar retention rate. Our commitment to customer success has enabled us to expand our footprint within customer organizations and facilitate the ongoing adoption of our enterprise software applications. We utilize NPS methodology to track our progress and drive continuous improvement.
Our Strategy for Growth
We believe the key elements of our strategy for growth are as follows: 
▪Acquire complementary software businesses. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products, and businesses to expand our footprint in target business functions, and to provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. Our experienced corporate development team continually monitors a pipeline of potential acquisition candidates. We believe that our acquisition experience and strategy give us a competitive advantage in identifying additional opportunities to expand our portfolio cloud-based applications to better serve our customers. We intend to prioritize acquisitions within the solution categories we currently offer.
▪Improve and enhance applications.  We intend to continue to invest in research and development and work closely with our customers to identify and improve applications, features and functionalities that address customer requirements across the enterprise spectrum. We also intend to continue to expand our support for key third-party integrations and presence in key partner marketplaces. 
▪Increase sales to existing customers. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the adoption of our applications within our existing customer organizations, particularly within divisions or departments that have not previously used our applications. We also intend to cross-sell additional applications to our existing customers, as very few of our customers currently use more than one of our applications. In addition, we intend to add new applications that will address additional functions within the enterprise spectrum. We believe these initiatives will significantly increase the value of our partnership with our customers, further strengthen our competitive position, and drive increased adoption of multiple applications by our customers.
▪Add new customers. We maintain direct sales and marketing capabilities to further grow our customer base. We also maintain indirect sales channels through alliances with strategic partners that can leverage our applications with their complementary services and technologies. In addition, we continue to expand the range of integrations between our software and third-party applications and platforms, which we believe make our applications more attractive to a broader audience of potential customers.
Customers
We service customers ranging from large global corporations and various government agencies as well as small and medium-sized businesses. Our customers operate in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, consulting services, technology, manufacturing, media, telecommunications, government, political, non-profit, healthcare, life sciences, retail and hospitality. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our recurring revenue was generated from what we consider to be major accounts. We consider customers with contracted annual recurring revenue of $25,000 or more to be “major accounts.”
Sales
We sell primarily through a direct sales organization comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel. In addition to our direct sales organization, we have an indirect sales organization that sells to distributors and value-added resellers. We employ a land-and-expand go-to-market strategy. After we demonstrate the value of an initial application to a customer, our sales and account management teams work to expand the adoption of that initial application across the customer, and cross-sell additional applications to address other software needs of the customer. Our customer success organization supports our direct sales efforts by managing the post-sale customer lifecycle.
Our subscription agreements are typically sold either on a per-seat basis or on a minimum contracted volume basis with overage fees billed in arrears, depending on the application being sold. Contract terms typically range from one to three years and are prepaid annually in advance. 
Marketing
Our marketing activities are designed to build awareness of the Upland brand and the solutions we offer, generate thought leadership, and create demand, resulting in leads and opportunities for our sales organizations. We focus a significant portion of our marketing activities on our existing customers to drive expansion and cross-sell opportunities. Our marketing programs target decision makers and influencers who participate in the buying cycles of various business functions inside large organizations including marketing, sales, contact centers, knowledge management, project management, information technology, business operations, human resources and legal. Our lead and demand generation programs include:
▪use of our website to provide information about us and our software applications, as well as educational opportunities for potential customers;
▪field marketing events for customers and prospective customers;
▪participation in, and sponsorship of, executive events, trade shows, and industry events;
▪our online virtual user conferences;
▪integrated digital marketing campaigns, including email, online, blogs, and webinars;
▪public relations, analyst relations, and social media initiatives; and
▪sales representatives who respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities.
Customer Success
Our customer success organization is structured to manage all aspects of our post-sale customer lifecycle. This organization consists of dedicated teams with a mission to drive adoption of our products, value realization, retention, and loyalty across our customer base. Our customer success organization has three core functional areas with strategic focus on customer relationship management:
•Customer Success Management. Our CSM team partners with customers throughout their lifecycle with the Upland family of products to ensure the customer is getting the most out of their technology investment. CSMs are experts in matching use of Upland products to a customer’s individual business context – sometimes bringing in or coordinating across other teams and internal resources where necessary to achieve the customer’s goals. 
•Professional Services. Our professional services team provides critical expertise in Upland’s product areas throughout the customer journey. During implementation, this team is responsible for coordinating all activities relating to the implementation, transition, and on-boarding of new customers and assisting new customers with the addition of new products to their accounts. Typical implementation professional services engagements vary in length from a few weeks to several months depending on the size and scope of the engagement and are in addition to services provided under our standard customer agreement and are fee-based. Beyond implementation, this team also provides advisory and consulting services, integration services and configuration change services as a customer’s business needs change over time.
•Customer Support. Our customer support team is conveniently available through multiple channels to help our customers maximize the return on their investment in our technology. We also provide 24/7/365 coverage to help ensure our software products maintain global availability. In addition, our customer support team manages and administers the Upland customer community to provide an outstanding knowledge base and self-service experience.
Our customer success organization manages programs to reinforce the ongoing business value of our applications. These service offerings include:
•Health checks and business reviews where we engage core users and business buyer sponsors to deliver a detailed scorecard and recommendations on driving product adoption and business value.
▪Consumption review and recommendations designed to deliver best practice recommendations for implementation strategy and a roadmap proposal for aligning the system with customers’ evolving process maturity to increase application usage.
▪Premier success plans that provide a bundled services, support, and product experience offering with two tiers (gold and platinum) designed to provide maximum customer value. 
▪Executive outreach where we promote open communication between the Upland leadership team and our customer’s key stakeholders, which is fully committed to making sure customers are delighted with their Upland experience, and customer executives. 
Technology and Operations
Our cloud-based family of applications utilizes a multi-tenant architecture and our customers access our applications using a secure Internet connection through a standard web browser. Our applications are easy to deploy, highly configurable, scalable, flexible, and secure, and provide our customers with a modern and intuitive user experience.
We have partnered with third-party hosting platforms to provide the hardware and infrastructure necessary to provide our services to our customers. Third-party hosting platform facilities provide 24/7/365 security, biometric access controls, redundant networking, power and environmental systems, and monitoring. Upland Software designs and operates the infrastructure architecture with fully redundant subsystems, highly available configurations, and defense in depth security zones.
Our applications are built on highly available and modular architectures that balance customer workloads across multiple servers. This allows us to provide a flexible method for scaling customers without impacting other parts of the architectural environment while maintaining the high levels of uptime our customers require.
Our family of applications offers high levels of security through logical data segregation of each customer’s data from the data of other customers and through limiting access to our platform to only those individuals authorized by our customers. In addition, sensitive customer data is encrypted “at rest” and “in transit” over secure connections to redundant storage in a secondary location.
We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to help preserve the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to data.
Competition
The overall markets we serve are rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new applications. The intensity and nature of our competition varies significantly across our range of enterprise applications. We compete against larger enterprise software companies that provide a full suite of Software as a Service, or SaaS, solutions focused on the functional areas we serve or the problems our cloud offerings address. We face competition both from point solution providers, including legacy on-premise enterprise systems, and other cloud-based software vendors that may address one or more of the functional elements of our applications. In addition, we face competition from manual processes and traditional tools, such as paper-based procedures, spreadsheets, and email.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
▪breadth and depth of application functionality;
▪ease of deployment and use of applications;
▪total cost of ownership;
▪levels of customer support satisfaction;
▪brand awareness and reputation;
▪capability for configuration, integration, scalability, and reliability of applications;
▪ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; and
▪level of integration among applications and with other enterprise systems.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on the strength of our applications, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer success organization, and our ability to acquire complementary technologies, products, and businesses to enhance the features and functionality of our applications.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, and renew agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each calendar year, resulting in our cash flow from operations historically being higher in the first quarter of each calendar year than in other quarters. We expect this seasonality to continue, or possibly increase in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Common Stock—Certain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.”
Regulation
We believe that our businesses and operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations. Any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations. Various legislative and administrative regulations applicable to us have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on our revenues, earnings or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our business, our capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impact. Refer to “Risk Factors” for further information. 
Human Capital
We believe that our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees is critical to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,006 full time employees, with the majority of our employees located in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Human capital measures and objectives we focus on in managing its business include the following:
•Recognition of Collaborative Problem Solvers. We have clearly defined company values that highlight the importance of collaboration, clear communication, and solving problems. We have annual awards that celebrate these values with both peer and management nominations at the business unit, function, and company-wide levels.
•Employee Talent Acquisition and Retention. We have always supported a “work anywhere” philosophy that allows us to recruit and retain top talent throughout the world. Our team members have the flexibility to work remotely, in an office where available, or a hybrid of the two, according to their preferences. Our total compensation and benefits packages are market competitive. Additionally, we maintain a system for providing our personnel an opportunity to express grievances or concerns, which includes an anonymous whistleblower hotline.
•Employee Engagement. We survey team members twice a year to gather feedback on key factors of employee experience, including work/life blend, social connection and learning and development. We have a formal Employee Resource Group program that fosters the formation of and provides support to employee-led groups dedicated to education and building community for team members with a shared characteristic or interest. 
•Development and Promotion of Leaders. Our high annual growth provides consistent promotion opportunities for our team members. We provide career ladders and development resources for all of our key functions. We provide leadership training for our managers.In addition, team members that join us through regular acquisitions have access to career development and promotion opportunities that would not have been available at their smaller companies.
•Creating a Culture of Customer Value and Improvement. Delivering customer value is core to our mission. Our UplandOne operating processes focus on quantifying customer satisfaction through NPS surveys, maintaining customer-driven software roadmaps, and empowering our team members to leverage expert resources from across the company to drive business success for our customers.
