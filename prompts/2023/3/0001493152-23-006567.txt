Products
 
Products are packaged in three distinct formats.
 
The Company’s ready-to-drink smoothie, “Twist & Go”™, has initially been focused towards the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program and Smart Snacks in Schools Program. This sweet fruit and creamy yogurt smoothie contains four ounces of yogurt and a half-cup of fruit/fruit juice and comes in three different flavors: strawberry banana, peach and mango pineapple. The product was originally launched in a bottled packaging format. The Company introduced Twist & Go™ cartons in 2022. Twist & Go™ contains no added sugars, preservatives, artificial flavors or colors. At only 125 -130 calories and with 5 grams of protein, it makes the perfect start to any day or on-the-go snack.
 
The Company’s bulk “Easy Pour” format, which contains all the ingredients necessary to make the beverage, is packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed in beverage dispensing equipment 1:1 with water. The Company has a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour” format, WHIRLZ 100% Juice Concentrate, that is specifically targeted for the aforementioned USDA national school meal programs. In addition, the Company received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to sell its smoothie products into all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and is currently in contract with and selling its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military bases in the United States and abroad.
 
The Company’s single serve format features portion controlled and ready-to-blend beverage ingredient packs or “beverage packs”. The beverage packs contain all the ingredients necessary to make the beverage, including the base (either sorbet, frozen yogurt, or ice cream), real fruit pieces, juices, and ice – five ounces of water are added before blending.
 
Distribution
 
The Company conducts sales through several channels, including National Accounts, Regional Accounts, and Broadline Distributors.

On October 26, 2015, Barfresh signed a five-year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages, a division of PepsiCo, to become its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh’s line of ready-to-blend smoothies and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. In February 2023, Barfresh terminated the agreement. Such termination is not anticipated to have a significant impact on sales.
 
Manufacturing
 
Barfresh utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of its products in the United States.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company incurred approximately $382,000 and $245,000, in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in Research and Development expenses was primarily attributable to the launch of the Company’s Twist & Go™ cartons, as well as costs incurred to investigate the quality issues experienced with the Manufacturer, more fully described in Item 7,
Competition
 
There is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the institutional and consumer purchasing level.
 
The Company distributes products institutionally primarily through distributors to school districts. The Company has recently launched its Twist & Go ready-to-drink smoothie as well as a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour” format, WHIRLZ 100% Juice Concentrates, both of which are specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, and Smart Snacks in Schools Program. At the institutional level, the Company competes with other food and beverage manufacturers, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and distribution reach.
 
The competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast food restaurant chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product to customers that fall within these segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand. The Company believes that its single serve products afford a very significant competitive advantage based on ease of use, portion control, premium quality, and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products. The Company also believes that its bulk “Easy Pour” product represents an attractive alternative delivery method for customers that serve high volume locations, where speed of service over extended periods is a critical requirement.
 
There may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Barfresh owns the domestic and international property rights to its products’ sealed pack of ingredients used in its single serve products.
 
In November 2011, the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada (Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was originally filed on December 4, 2007 and it was granted during August of 2017. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16, 2005 and it was granted on May 27, 2014.
 
On October 15, 2013, the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights, which were filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed the PCT. In addition, the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.
