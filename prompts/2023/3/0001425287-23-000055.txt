ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an American technology company with a vision to pioneer the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles. Our primary focus is to provide sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector. We design and manufacture all-electric delivery trucks and drone systems, including the technology that optimizes the way these vehicles operate. We are focused on our core competency of bringing our electric delivery vehicle platforms to serve the last mile delivery market.
Commercial Vehicles
We are an American-based Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”), and our products are marketed under the Workhorse® brand. All Workhorse last-mile delivery trucks are assembled in our Union City, Indiana production facility. 
We believe our all-electric commercial vehicles offer fleet operators significant benefits, which include:
•Lower total cost-of-ownership as compared to conventional gas/diesel vehicles;
•Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses;
•Increased package deliveries per day through use of more efficient delivery methods;
•Decreased vehicle emissions and reduced carbon footprint; and
•Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.
Electric Delivery Truck Platforms
Product Roadmap
Workhorse has made significant progress executing on its revised strategic product roadmap for our electric vehicle delivery offerings. The foundation of this plan is the development of two new truck chassis platforms, the W56 and what we call the WNext. The W56, based on long-standing Company know-how in the Class 5 and 6 truck chassis market, is a fully capable medium duty chassis, designed for last-mile delivery and high payload applications and is expected to begin production in 2023. The WNext platform will be our second generation, low floor, advanced content offering for the truck chassis market and is expected to begin production in 2025.
In order to accelerate time-to-market for customers seeking delivery of electric vehicles during 2022, we entered into a strategic supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with GreenPower Motor Company Inc. (“GreenPower”). Under the agreement, we have exclusive rights to sell Class 4 step vans based on the GreenPower supplied base vehicle. Our Class 4 vehicles are a zero-emission chassis designed to be sold in either a cab chassis version (“W4 CC”) or a step van version (“W750”) made to haul various cargo and take on both mid and last-mile routes. The W4 CC became available for sale in 2022 while we expect the W750 will be available for sale in the United States and Canada in 2023. Both are sold under the Workhorse brand and with Workhorse after sales and support service. 
C-Series Electric Delivery Truck
We announced the development of the C-Series electric delivery truck in 2017, a vehicle aimed at the Class 3 truck market which leveraged an ultra-low floor delivery vehicle platform. We utilized our extensive customer experience gained from working with our E-Series customers to design this product. During 2022, after thorough engineering review, durability testing and careful consideration, the Company determined the increasing time, cost and resources being devoted to the C1000 were better allocated to the development and production of its other vehicles and products. In December 2022, the Company announced that it was discontinuing the C1000 program and we are now transitioning our manufacturing focus from the C1000 to the Class 4 - 6 vehicles, W4 CC, W750, W56 and WNext platforms. 
E-Series Electric Delivery Vans
Workhorse E-100 battery-electric and E-GEN range-extended delivery vans are used by our customers on daily routes across the United States. We have built and delivered approximately 360 electric and range-extended medium-duty delivery trucks, 
many of which remain in active service, to our customers with a combined mileage total of more than 9 million miles. Our customers include companies such as FedEx Ground and United Parcel Service.
Stables & Stalls
In 2022, Workhorse purchased ESG Logistics Corp., a provider of package pickup and delivery services, and began operating a series of FedEx Ground delivery routes in the greater Cincinnati area under an initiative known as Stables & Stalls. Stables & Stalls provides the Company with firsthand experiences of the challenges and benefits independent fleet operators experience while executing last-mile delivery operations and making the transition to electric vehicles. This opportunity also provides the Company unique and valuable research and data into how our customers access reliable vehicles, plan for and manage adequate charging infrastructure, as well as  training and maintenance services which is critical for small fleet operators that choose to make the electric vehicle ("EV") transition.
Aero
HorseFly™
As part of our growing technology portfolio, the Company has been developing small Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) for several years. We have 2 product lines in the UAS space. One is a package delivery drone known as Horsefly. The other is a product designed and developed for use in more austere operating environments for humanitarian assistance and logistical operations ("HALO"). All Workhorse drone systems are designed and built in our Mason, Ohio facility. 
Our HorseFly UAS includes a custom-designed, purpose-built, all-electric Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (“UAV”), a proprietary Ground Control Station (“GCS”), and equipment that supports integrating the UAS with our delivery trucks and other applications. The HorseFly UAV is an airborne work truck, that can carry a significant payload for 10 miles. Our rugged components are designed to support the high volumes, long duty days and ease of maintenance demanded by the commercial package delivery industry. 
In 2020, Workhorse began the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA”) Type Certification (“TC”) process for our Horsefly UAS. Compliance with FAA regulations governing TC helps set a very high bar for system performance and we believe it is important to have a TC system in our product offerings. We believe safety, reliability and capability are the primary points of value in a commercial UAS. Presently, the FAA allows some exceptions for commercial operations to use non-certificated drone systems. As the industry matures, we expect the FAA will require certificated aircraft in most commercial operations.
We have developed subsystems and many discrete functions to improve the safety, reliability and performance of our systems. One subsystem is a proprietary winch that can lower and raise significant payloads from safe altitudes. Another is a truck integration system that allows continuous operations from a truck in the field. Our Ground Control Software software allows remote pilots in command to control more than one aircraft simultaneously. 
Workhorse was granted a patent on our UAS, and though initially designed as a complimentary system delivering packages from our electric trucks, the latest iteration of our UAS supports package delivery point-to-point, enabling deliveries to and from anywhere, allowing it to serve a broader customer base. 
In tests and demonstrations, Workhorse has flown thousands of missions in the National Airspace System, demonstrating package deliveries for large multi-national companies in Ohio, Michigan, Florida and California. Our aircraft has proven to be safe, reliable, and capable. In addition, we have successfully demonstrated the drone’s enhanced functionality working with local, state and federal government agencies to validate other, new cases. For example, in January 2022 we received a grant from the US Department of Agriculture in support of enhanced mapping and data analysis of farmland in underserved communities in the States of Mississippi and Arkansas.
Locations and Facilities
Our company headquarters, research and development facilities are located in the Greater Cincinnati area in Ohio. We manufacture and test our electric delivery trucks at our manufacturing facility located in Union City, Indiana. During 2022, we opened an engineering and technical design center in Wixom, Michigan as well as an engineering, technical design and production facility for our drone systems in Mason, Ohio.
Marketing
There are over 350,000 last-mile delivery trucks replaced annually and the last mile delivery industry is the fastest growing vehicle industry in an approximately $22.0 billion industry space. Our sales team is focused on building our market share in this space by targeting commercial transportation companies and developing a dealer network.
We have established the commercial delivery vehicles as our core business and strive to be the best choice for a vehicle in this industry. Our sales plan is to meet with the top potential customers and obtain purchase orders for new electric vehicles to be manufactured in our production facility.
Strategic Relationships 
GreenPower Motor Company Inc.: On February 28, 2022, Workhorse entered into a strategic vehicle purchase and supply agreement with GreenPower Motor Company, Inc. to purchase base vehicles in the Class 4, medium-duty vehicle class. Under the agreement, GreenPower provides Workhorse with base vehicles for completion at our Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility. Workhorse began accepting deliveries of the base vehicles in July of 2022 and began executing on the exclusive rights to sell the vehicles under the Workhorse brand and with Workhorse after sales and support service in the United States and Canada. 
Tropos Technologies, Inc. ("Tropos"): On August 8, 2022, the Company entered into an Assembly Services Agreement (the “Assembly Agreement”) with Tropos. The Assembly Agreement provides for assembly services at its Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility to assemble an annual quantity of 2,000 vehicles in 2023, 2,000 vehicles in 2024, and 250 vehicles in 2025 for a total of 4,250 vehicles. Workhorse began accepting deliveries of the vehicle kits to be assembled in December of 2022. 
Mitsubishi HC Capital Inc ("Mitsubishi"): Mitsubishi (formerly Hitachi Capital America) continues to be our primary financing partner to market and distribute our electric vehicles through an existing and well-established commercial vehicle dealer network throughout North America. Mitsubishi enables Workhorse to have our vehicles sold and financed from the moment they roll off the production line, into a shared pool of vehicles, where they become visible and available to every Mitsubishi connected dealer. The dealer can configure additional equipment, schedule upfit integration and delivery in a seamless manner.
Amerit Fleet Solutions (“Amerit”): Workhorse has signed a strategic agreement with Amerit to provide maintenance and repair services for Workhorse vehicles, utilizing their mobile maintenance units and technicians. This provides Workhorse with on ground maintenance and warranty service capabilities in a great majority of locations across the United States.
Technology, Research and Development
The majority of our research and development is conducted in-house at our facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio and is centered on drive train, telematics, related EV centric feature sets and drone systems. During 2022, we expanded our research and development footprint to include the addition of new staff and facilities in Wixom, MI. The Wixom facility is intended to focus additional resources for product development and validation activities for existing and future programs. Additionally, we contract with engineering firms to assist with validation and certification requirements as well as specific development and vehicle integration tasks. Our research and development activity over the past year has focused on the development of the W56 and the WNext platforms.
Metron
We continue to develop and maintain our Metron remote data management system that tracks the performance of all the vehicles we deploy, providing a service management system and the communication channel between our customers and partners. We are currently focused on adding the ability to integrate Metron Telematics with the internal telematics and data management systems of our clients, as well as expanding our ability to present and analyze data within a proprietary Workhorse interface. In 2022 we began development of Metron 2.0, a brand new software architecture that will be the base for Workhorse telematics and a suite of business applications such as fleet management and service and repair, which is expected to launch in 2023.
Workhorse also has a patented flight control system. This system enables the lowest total cost of ownership, simplifies flight planning, and provides an intuitive, easy to use flight planning and execution capability that makes operation of our aircraft safe, consistent, and reliable. The system can support one or many UAS simultaneously. The system defines vertical and lateral navigation, points of origination and destination, safety zones, no-fly zones, and other advanced operational features. Our trip log system provides operators with continuous status reports, allowing timely maintenance planning and spare parts support. 
Competition
Traditional OEMs
Traditional OEM's continue to increase their electrification efforts, which have been highly focused on consumer-based vehicles. In 2022, the shift in consumer behavior continued, placing an increased focus on the commercial delivery space. To date, plans have primarily been focused on lighter and smaller last mile vehicles, such as Ford with their Transit Connect and larger Transit models, and General Motors with their recent unveiling of the Brightdrop company and EV600 product. All of these vehicles have 600 cubic foot or less of cargo capacity. In contrast, Workhorse is focused on the 650 - 1200 cubic foot category. Our market research and direct customer engagements have helped us provide value to some of the largest and most efficient last mile delivery companies in North America, through deployment of our E-Series, which was produced until 2018. Current competition in this segment from traditional chassis manufacturers include a recently released EV strip chassis product from Freightliner Custom Chassis, integrated with components from third party suppliers.
Non-Traditional OEMs
As the rapid global shift towards home delivery continues, many companies are seeking to provide delivery solutions aimed at a sub-600 cubic foot cargo area. It is our expectation that these non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford . We believe one of the main reasons for this race towards smaller vehicles is to provide a sub-10,000 pound gross vehicle weight (“GVW”) offering, as vehicles above 10,000 pound GVW require a more expensive, commercially licensed and trained driver pool.
Supply Chain 
We continue to develop relationships with suppliers of key parts, components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products such as batteries, electronics, and vehicle chassis that are sourced from suppliers across the world. As we continue to execute on our new vehicle platforms, we will continue to identify supplier relationship and vehicle platform synergies which may allow us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale. Where available, we will utilize multiple supply sources for key parts, and we work to qualify multiple supply sources to allow us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies and minimize potential production risks related to supply chain.
Regulatory
Our electric vehicles are designed to comply with required government regulations and industry standards. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have on our business.
Emission and fuel economy standards
Government regulation related to climate change is in effect at the U.S. federal and state levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which is applicable for model years 2018 through 2020. EPA and NHTSA also issued a final rule on August 16, 2016 increasing the stringency of these standards for model years 2021 through 2027.
The rules provide emission standards for CO2 and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors; (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and (iii) vocational vehicles. We believe Workhorse vehicles would be considered “vocational vehicles” and “heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans” under the rules. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.
The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, such as the Workhorse vehicles, including an engine Averaging, Banking and Trading (“ABT”) program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs will allow for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs will allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements more than the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity (“CoC”) issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) requires we obtain a CoC with respect to emissions and mileage requirements for our vehicles. The CoC is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. Workhorse received Executive Order A-445-0003 for MY2020 vehicles and Executive Order A-445-0004 for MY2021 vehicles.
Vehicle safety and testing
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) substantially regulates our aerospace vehicles. Those regulations govern two important areas: operating rules and aircraft certification rules. The FAA’s operating rules govern all operations of all aerial vehicles in the National Airspace System of the United States. The FAA’s certification rules help define the safety and reliability requirements of certain aircraft and systems. Not every aircraft and system are required to be FAA certificated, though typically certification is required for commercial operations like package delivery. 
Workhorse is applying for FAA Type Certification for its small UAS. We believe it is important to achieve FAA certification of our products. Though we believe our design and execution comply with FAA requirements for certification, should we or the FAA determine either a safety defect or noncompliance exist with respect to our aircraft or its systems, it could add substantially to the time and expense of certification. Should the FAA change its rules for either certification or operations, it could render our designs non-competitive in the marketplace.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants. We seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. Unpatented research, development, know-how, and engineering skills make a vital contribution to our business, and we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
We are not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of ownership of our trademarks that could materially affect our business. It is our policy to pursue registration of our primary trademarks whenever possible and to vigorously defend our patents, trademarks and other proprietary marks against infringement or other threats to the extent practical under applicable laws.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”)
Workhorse’s mission is based on the foundation of the commercial vehicle transition to zero emissions. To do this, we embrace a world with reduced carbon emissions in both energy generation and consumption. We are designing and manufacturing a key ingredient of the transportation ecosystem evolution to achieve this goal - last mile electric delivery vehicles. 
We are investing to make our facilities more efficient and sustainably designed and are also driving a continuous safety mindset by focusing on worker engagement. In addition, we are focused on reducing the carbon footprint throughout our supply chain. We are committed to sourcing responsibly produced materials from suppliers who have social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations.
Finally, we believe that sound corporate governance is essential to helping us achieve our goal, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company. During 2022, we established our first ESG Committee, made up of leaders from across our company, and they began regular presentations on our related initiatives to our Board of Directors, which guides our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, our full-time headcount for our employees was 331. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We understand that our innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in our space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate strategy.
Governance. Our Board of Directors and its committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters. The Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee maintains responsibility to review, discuss and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including compensation and benefit programs. Our collective recommendations to the Board of Directors and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and care for our employees in a manner that aligns with our core values.
Our management team administers all employment matters, such as recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation and rewards, performance management and professional development. We continuously evaluate and enhance our internal policies, process and practices to increase employee engagement and productivity.
We have an employee hotline, providing our employees an opportunity to report matters such as safety concerns, fraud or other misconduct. All reported matters are reviewed in accordance with established protocols by our Legal, Human Resources and Internal Audit departments, who monitor the remediation and disposition of any reported matters.
Support Employee Well-being and Engagement. We support the overall well-being of our employees from a physical, emotional, financial, and social perspective. Our well-being program includes a long-standing practice of flexible paid time off, life planning benefits, wellness platforms and employee assistance programs.
Offer Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive and fair compensation and innovative benefits offerings, tying incentive compensation to both business and individual performance, offering competitive maternal/paternal leave policies and providing meaningful retirement and health benefits. 
Promote Sense of Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our values and spot awards to recognize employee contributions. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance and retention. We conduct annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their personal manager and also conducts a self-assessment, a process which empowers our employees. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of objectives specific to the employee’s department or role.
Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training, and education, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the Company and management and leadership development programs.
