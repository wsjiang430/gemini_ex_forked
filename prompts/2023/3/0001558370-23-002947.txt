GENERAL
​
We are a Fortune 1000 Global Solutions Provider that simplifies the IT customer experience, guiding the connection between people and technology. Our dedicated account managers partner with customers to design, deploy, and support cutting-edge IT environments using the latest hardware, software, and services. We provide a wide range of IT solutions, from the desktop to the cloud—including computer systems, data center solutions, software and peripheral equipment, networking communications, and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers, distributors, and other suppliers. Our Technology Solutions Group, or TSG, and state-of-the-art Technology Integration and Distribution Center, or TIDC, with ISO 9001:2015 certified technical configuration lab offer end-to-end services related to the design, configuration, and implementation of IT solutions. Our team also provides a comprehensive portfolio of managed services and professional services. These services are performed by our personnel and by third-party providers. Our GlobalServe offering ensures worldwide coverage for our multinational customers, delivering global procurement solutions through our network of in-country suppliers in over 170 countries. 
​
The “Connection®” brand includes Connection Business Solutions, Connection Enterprise Solutions, and Connection Public Sector Solutions, which provide IT solutions and services to small to medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, enterprise, and public sector markets. We united all of our subsidiaries into one cohesive brand, reflecting the promise of our blue arc and our mission to connect people with technology that enhances growth, elevates productivity, and empowers innovation. These entities represent our three operating segments and their respective markets:
​

● | Connection Enterprise Solutions – serving large enterprise customers
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Connection Business Solutions – serving SMBs
--+---------------------------------------------

​

● | Connection Public Sector Solutions – serving federal, state, and local government and educational institutions
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Financial results for each of our segments are included in the financial statements attached hereto. We generate sales through (i) outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by sales representatives focused on the business, educational, healthcare, and government markets, (ii) our websites, and (iii) direct responses from customers responding to our advertising media. We offer a broad selection of over 460,000 products at competitive prices, including products from vendors like Apple, Cisco Systems, Dell, Dell-EMC, Hewlett-Packard Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft, and VMware, and we partner with more than 2,500 suppliers. We are able to leverage our state-of-the art logistic capabilities to rapidly ship product to customers.
​
Since our founding in 1982, we have consistently served our customers’ needs by providing innovative, reliable, and timely service and technical support, and by offering an extensive assortment of industry-leading products through knowledgeable, well-trained sales and support teams. Our strategy’s effectiveness is reflected in the recognition we have received, including being named to the Fortune 1000 and the CRN Solution Provider 500 for twenty-two straight years. In recent years, we have received numerous awards, including the Microsoft Excellence in Operations, Double Gold Level Award for delivering market-leading operational excellence, Aruba Federal Public Sector Partner of the Year, HPE Federal GreenLake Partner of the Year, and HP U.S. Personal Systems National Solution Provider of the Year Award, as well as being named to the CRN Tech Elite 250 for the seventh year. Connection has also been twice named “America’s Best-in-State Employers” by Forbes. Our technical experts hold more than 2,500 professional certifications, and we have been awarded industry-leading partner authorizations, including Microsoft Azure Expert Managed Service Provider status and Google Cloud premier partner status. We believe this pursuit of excellence and our ability to understand our customers’ needs and provide comprehensive and effective IT solutions has earned us strong brand name recognition and a broad and loyal customer base. We also believe that through our strong vendor relationships we can provide an efficient supply chain and be an effective IT solution provider for our diverse customer base. 
​

We strive to identify the unique needs of our corporate, government, educational, and small business customers, and have designed our business processes to enable our customers to effectively manage their IT systems. We provide value by offering our customers efficient design, integration, deployment, and support of their IT environments. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 752 sales representatives. Sales representatives are responsible for managing enterprise, commercial, and public sector accounts, as specialization and a deep understanding of unique customer environments are more important than ever. These sales representatives focus on current and prospective customers and are supported by an increasing number of engineering, technical, and administrative staff through our TSG and Technical Sales Organization, or TSO. Our Industry Solutions Group, or ISG, provides our sales team and customers with insights and guidance customized to the unique needs of our vertical markets, including healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing. We believe that increasing our salesforce productivity is important to our future success, and we have increased our headcount and investments in our sales and sales support teams accordingly.
​
We market our products and services through our websites: www.connection.com, www.connection.com/enterprise, www.connection.com/publicsector, and www.macconnection.com. Our websites provide extensive product information, customized pricing, rich content, and a digital platform for online orders. We are not including the information contained in our websites as part of, or incorporating by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
MARKET AND COMPETITION
​
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 39.8% of our sales from SMBs, 42.4% from medium-to-large businesses (Fortune 1000), and 17.8% from government and educational institutions. The United States IT market that we serve is estimated to be approximately $200 billion.
​
The largest segment of this market is served by local and regional Value-Added Resellers, or VARs, many of whom we believe are transitioning from the hardware and software products business to higher-margin IT services. We have transitioned from an end-user or desktop-centric computing supplier to a network or enterprise-wide IT solutions supplier. We have also partnered with third-party technology and telecommunications service providers to offer our customers access to the same services and technical expertise as local and regional VARs, but with a more extensive product selection at generally lower prices.
​
Intense competition for customers has led manufacturers of our IT products to use all available channels, including solutions providers, to distribute their products. Certain of these manufacturers who have traditionally used resellers to distribute their products have, from time to time, established their own direct marketing operations, including sales through the Internet.
​
We believe new entrants to the IT solutions channel must overcome a number of obstacles, including:
​

● | substantial time and resources required to build a customer base of meaningful size and profitability for cost-effective operation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | significant upfront costs of developing the information systems and operating infrastructure required to successfully compete as a national solutions provider;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | purchasing and operating efficiencies enjoyed by larger and more established competitors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | difficulty building relationships with vendors needed to gain favorable product allocations and attractive pricing terms; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | difficulty identifying and recruiting management personnel with significant direct marketing experience in the industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUSINESS STRATEGIES
​
We believe that we have become our customers’ IT provider of choice by calming the confusion surrounding IT procurement and solving complex business challenges with innovative IT solutions designed to meet their increased productivity, mobility, virtualization, and security needs in a continuously evolving IT environment. We provide enhanced value by assisting our customers in cost-effectively maximizing business opportunities provided by new technologies and advanced service solutions. The key elements of our business strategies include:
​

● | Providing consistent customer service before, during, and after the sale. We believe that we have earned a reputation for providing superior customer service by consistently focusing on our customers’ needs. Empathy for the challenges technology procurement presents to people is at the heart of our culture and serves as a foundation for long-lasting and rewarding partnerships we create with organizations of every size and industry. We have dedicated our resources to developing strong, long-term relationships with our customers by accurately assessing their IT needs, and providing scalable, high-quality solutions and services through our knowledgeable, well-trained personnel. Through operational excellence, we believe we have created efficient delivery programs that provide a quality buying experience for our customers.

​

● | Offering a broad product selection at competitive prices. We offer a broad range of IT products and solutions, including personal computers and related peripheral products, servers, storage, managed services, cloud solutions, and networking infrastructure, at costs that allow our customers to be more productive while maximizing their IT budgets. Our advanced solution offerings include network, server, storage, and mission-critical onsite installation and support using proprietary cloud-based service management software. We offer products and enhanced service capabilities with aggressive price and performance standards, all with the convenience of one-stop shopping for technology solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Simplifying technology product procurement for corporate customers. We offer Internet-based procurement options to eliminate complexity and enhance customer value, as well as lower the cost of procurement for our customers. We specialize in Internet-based solutions and provide electronic integration between our customers and suppliers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Offering targeted IT solutions. Our customers seek solutions to increasingly complex IT infrastructure demands. To better address their business needs, we have focused our solution service capabilities on several key areas: data and automation, workplace transformation, cloud, cybersecurity, and managed services. Our TSG and TSO are responsible for understanding the infrastructure needs of our customers, and for designing cost-effective technology solutions to address them. We have also partnered with third-party providers to make available a range of IT support services, including asset assessment, implementation, maintenance, and disposal services. We believe we can leverage these focus areas to enable us to capture a greater share of our customers’ IT expenditures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Maintaining a strong brand name and customer awareness. Since our founding in 1982, we have built a strong brand name and customer awareness. We have been named to the Fortune 1000 and the CRN Solution Provider 500 for each of the last twenty-two years. We actively work with our existing customers to become their IT provider of choice for products and enhanced solution services, while seeking to ensure our reputation of high-quality customer service, tailored marketing programs, and competitive pricing lead the way to expanding our share of the overall IT market. Through the use of creative, consistent marketing activities, our goal is to strengthen the Connection brand and reinforce our reputation as a trusted IT advisor with a history of innovation and customer-centric service.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Maintaining long-standing vendor relationships. Our close partnerships with leading technology manufacturers and vendors provide our team with access to the latest product offerings, training assets, and support resources. We have a history of strong relationships with vendors, and were among the first national solutions providers qualified by manufacturers to market computer systems to end users. By working closely with our vendors to provide an efficient channel for the advertising and distribution of their products and solutions, we expect to expand market share and generate opportunities for optimizing partner incentive

programs. We promote communication and collaboration with our partner community at every level of our organization, from sales and product management to leadership. We meet regularly with our partners to share feedback and explore strategies to promote greater engagement and better serve our mutual customers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
GROWTH STRATEGIES
​
Our growth strategies are designed to increase revenues by maximizing operational efficiencies while offering innovative products and value-added service offerings, increasing penetration of our existing customers, and expanding our customer base. Our six key elements of growth are:
​

● | Expanding hardware and software offerings. We offer our customers an extensive range of IT hardware and software products, and in response to customer demand, we continually evaluate and add new products to our offerings as they become available. We also work closely with vendors to identify and source first-to-market product offerings at aggressive prices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Expanding IT solution services offerings. We strive to accelerate solution and service growth by providing creative solutions to the increasingly complex hardware and software needs of our customers. Our converged data center, networking, mobility, security, cloud solutions, lifecycle, and software services practice groups consist of industry-certified and product-certified engineers, as well as highly specialized third-party providers. We believe our investment in these seven practice areas may increase our share of our customers’ annual IT expenditures by broadening the range of products and services they purchase from us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Targeting customer segments. Through increased targeted marketing, we seek to expand the number of our active customers and generate additional sales to existing customers by providing more value-added services and solutions. We have also developed digital marketing capabilities, which include but are not limited to digital remarketing, digital buying guides, Google shopping integration, along with social media advertising and search engine optimization. All of these aforementioned methods also help us fine tune and optimize our Internet marketing campaigns that focus on select markets, such as healthcare, retail, financial, and manufacturing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Increasing productivity of our sales representatives. We believe that higher sales productivity is the key to leveraging our expense structure and driving future profitability improvements. We invest significant resources in training new sales representatives and providing ongoing training to experienced personnel. Our training and evaluation programs are focused towards assisting our sales personnel in understanding and anticipating our customers’ IT needs, with the goal of fostering loyal customer relationships. We also provide our sales representatives with technical support on more complex sales opportunities through our group of technical solution specialists.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Migrating to cloud-based solutions for our customers. Cloud computing is a key driver of new IT spending as our customers seek scalable, cost-effective solutions. We plan to expand our cloud-based solution sales and assist our customers in navigating the complex and growing field of cloud-solution offerings. This focus on cloud includes investing in the training and certification resources required to help our customers adopt and optimize cloud technologies. In 2022, we maintained Microsoft Azure Expert Managed Service Provider status as well as Google Cloud premier partner status—two exclusive designations that require an intensive auditing process and a proven record of delivering exceptional customer service and in-depth technical expertise around core cloud competencies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances. We seek acquisitions and alliances that add new customers, strengthen our product and solution offerings, add management talent, and produce operating results which are accretive to our core business earnings.

SERVICE AND SUPPORT
​
Since our founding in 1982, our primary objective has been to provide products and services that meet the demands and needs of our customers and to supplement those products with up-to-date product information and excellent customer service and support. We believe that offering our customers superior value, through a combination of product knowledge, consistent and reliable service and support, and leading products at competitive prices, differentiates us from other national solutions providers and serves as the foundation for developing a broad and loyal customer base.
​
We invest in training programs for our service and support personnel, with an emphasis on putting customer needs and service first. Supplementing our salesforce, our TSG and TSO offer in-depth technical support across a wide range of advanced technology solutions. These teams of engineers and solution architects design end-to-end IT solutions tailored to our customers’ unique environments and serve as technology consultants. Our TIDC ensures a superior customer experience, with seamless configuration, deployment, and support services. Product support technicians assist customers with questions concerning compatibility, installation, and more difficult questions relating to product use. The product support technicians authorize customers to return defective or incompatible products to either the manufacturer or to us for warranty service. In-house TIDC technicians perform both warranty and non-warranty repair on most of the major systems and hardware products.
​
Using our customized information system, we transmit our customer orders either to our TIDC or to our drop-ship suppliers, depending on product availability, for processing immediately after a customer receives credit approval. At our distribution center, we also perform custom configuration services, which typically includes custom imaging, the installation and integration of additional components, and other technology enhancements. Our customers may select the method of delivery that best meets their needs and is most cost effective, ranging from expedited overnight delivery for urgently needed items to ground freight. 
​
 Our inventory stocking strategy is based on economics and the general availability of the product. We will stock product where there is an economic advantage to do so, or the product is in constrained supply. We also will stock product to support customer rollouts, including product that is running through our configuration and integration services prior to shipment.
​
MARKETING AND SALES
​
We sell our products through our direct marketing channels to (i) SMBs including small office/home office customers, (ii) government and educational institutions, and (iii) medium-to-large businesses. We strive to be the primary supplier of IT products and solutions to our existing and prospective customers by providing exemplary customer service. We use multiple marketing approaches to reach existing and prospective customers, including:
​

● | outbound telemarketing and field sales;
--+----------------------------------------

​

● | digital, web, and print media advertising; and
--+-----------------------------------------------

​

● | targeted marketing programs to specific customer populations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

​
All of our marketing approaches emphasize our broad product offerings, fast delivery, customer support, competitive pricing, and our wide range of service solutions.
​
Sales Channels. We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer relationships and to encourage repeat purchases is largely dependent on the strength of our sales personnel and programs. Because our customers’ primary contact with us is through our sales representatives, we are committed to maintaining a qualified, knowledgeable, and motivated sales staff with a principal focus on customer service.
​
Outbound Telemarketing and Field Sales. We seek to build loyal relationships with potential high-volume customers by assigning them to individual account managers. We believe that customers respond favorably to one-on-one relationships with personalized, well-trained account managers. Once established, these one-on-one relationships are 

5



maintained and enhanced through frequent telecommunications and targeted electronic communications, as well as other marketing materials designed to meet each customer’s specific IT needs. We pay most of our account managers a base annual salary plus incentive compensation. Incentive compensation is tied generally to gross profit dollars produced by the individual account manager.
​
E-commerce Sales. We generally provide product descriptions and prices for all of the products we offer through the e-commerce websites we maintain and operate. Our Connection website also provides updated information for more than 460,000 items. We offer, and continuously update, selected product offerings and other special buys. We believe our websites are an important source of sales and a communication tool for improving customer service.
​
For example, our Enterprise Solutions Segment’s business process and operations are primarily Web-based. Most of its corporate customers utilize a customized Web page to quickly search, source, and track IT products. Our Enterprise Solution business website aggregates the current available inventories of its largest IT suppliers into a single online source for its corporate customers. Its custom designed Internet-based system, MarkITplace®, provides corporate buyers with comparative pricing from several suppliers as well as special pricing arranged through the manufacturer.
​
The Internet supports three key business initiatives for us:
​

● | Customer choice — We have built our business on the premise that our customers should be able to choose how they interact with us - be it by telephone, or by means of their desktop or mobile device via email or the Internet.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Lowering transactions costs — Our website tools include robust product search features and Internet Business Accounts (customized Web pages), which allow customers to quickly and easily find information about products of interest to them. If customers still have questions, they may call our account managers. Such phone calls are typically shorter and have higher close rates than calls from customers who have not visited our websites first.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Leveraging the time of experienced sales representatives — Our investments in technology-based sales and service programs allow our sales representatives more time to build and maintain relationships with our customers and to help them to solve their business problems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operating Segments. We conduct our business operations through three operating segments: Business Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and Public Sector Solutions.
​
Business Solutions Segment. Our principal target markets in this segment are small to medium-sized business customers. We use a combination of outbound telemarketing, including some on-site sales solicitation by business development managers, and Internet sales through customized Internet Business Accounts, to reach these customers. 
Enterprise Solutions Segment. Through our custom designed Web-based system, we are able to offer our larger corporate customers an efficient and effective method of sourcing, evaluating, purchasing, and tracking a wide variety of IT products and services. Our strategy is to be the primary single source procurement portal for our large corporate customers.
​
Public Sector Solutions Segment. We use a combination of outbound telemarketing, including some on-site sales solicitation by business development managers, and Internet sales through customized Internet Business Accounts, to reach these customers. We target each of the four distinct market sectors within this segment—federal government, higher educational institutions, school grades K-12, and state and local governments.

The following table sets forth the relative distribution of net sales by operating segment:
​
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------+---+--------------------------+---+------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Years Ended December 31, | 
​ | | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Operating Segment | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
Enterprise Solutions | ​ | 42 | % | 43 | % | 43 | %
Business Solutions | ​ | 40 | ​ | 38 | ​ | 37 | ​
Public Sector Solutions | ​ | 18 | ​ | 19 | ​ | 20 | ​
Total | ​ | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

​
​
Our ISG works across all operating segments to service the unique needs of healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing customers. Within each of these vertical markets, our ISG experts offer technology solutions and guidance backed by real-world experience. Our ISG combines extensive knowledge of the latest technologies, brands, and trends with industry experience that reassures our customers that we understand their businesses and their technology challenges. Our brand, and each of our operating segments, is supported by targeted marketing campaigns across a variety of media:
​
Digital. We utilize a series of digital programs, in conjunction with advanced data analytics, to identify prospective customers and generate new leads within our existing customer base. These programs include website, email, blog, social media, electronic catalogs, webinars, and video/multimedia promotions.
​
Specialty Marketing. In addition to our digital marketing efforts, we maintain a strong presence at industry tradeshows and conventions across the country, including a number of healthcare and education IT conferences. We also host a series of Technology Summits each year, with a focus on building stronger relationships with our customers and reinforcing our reputation as a trusted source of expertise.
​
Customers. We maintain an extensive database of customers and prospects. However, no single customer accounted for more than 4% of our consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021, and 2020. While no single agency of the federal government comprised more than 4% of consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021, and 2020, aggregate revenue to the federal government was 3.6%, 3.9%, and 4.6% in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The federal government (and the other government entities we service) generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on any of our operating segments. The majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders. We do not have individual orders in our backlog that are material to our business, and as a result, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular dates is an indication of future results.
​
PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISING
​
We continuously focus on expanding the breadth of our product and service offerings. We currently offer our customers over 460,000 IT products designed for business applications from more than 2,500 vendors. These products consist of hardware, including devices, peripherals, accessories, servers, and networking products, along with software and services. We select the products we sell based upon their technology and effectiveness, market demand, product

features, quality, price, margins, and warranties. The following table sets forth our percentage of net sales for major product categories:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

Total | ​ | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

​
We offer a 30-day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise. Returns of non-defective products are subject to restocking fees. Substantially all of the products marketed by us are warranted by the manufacturer. We generally accept returns directly from the customer and then either credit the customer’s account or ship the customer a replacement or similar product from our inventory.
​
PURCHASING AND VENDOR RELATIONS
​
Product purchases from Ingram Micro, Inc., TD Synnex Corporation and Dell Inc. accounted for approximately 23%, 22% and 15% respectively, of our total product purchases in 2022. Product purchases from Ingram Micro, Inc., TD Synnex Corporation and Dell Inc. accounted for approximately 23%, 23% and 12% respectively, of our total product purchases in 2021. Product purchases from Ingram Micro, Inc., TD Synnex Corporation and HP Inc. accounted for approximately 21%, 15% and 12% respectively, of our total product purchases in 2020. No other singular vendor supplied more than 10% of our total product purchases in 2022, 2021 and 2020. We believe that, while we may experience some short-term disruption if products from Ingram Micro, Inc., TD Synnex Corporation, HP Inc., Dell Inc., or any of these vendors become unavailable to us, alternative sources are available. 
​
Products manufactured by HP Inc. collectively represented approximately 14%, 15% and 18% of our net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that in the event we experience either a short-term or permanent disruption of supply of HP Inc. products, such disruption would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
​
Throughout the year, we have seen continued improvement in the supply chain, although pockets of constraints still exist with a few suppliers, most notably with HPE and Cisco.
​
Many product suppliers reimburse us for advertisements or other cooperative marketing programs through various marketing vehicles. Reimbursements may be in the form of discounts, advertising allowances, and/or rebates. We also receive allowances from certain vendors based upon the volume of our purchases or sales of the vendors’ products by us. Some of our vendors offer limited price protection in the form of rebates or credits against future purchases. We may also participate in end-of-life product and other special purchases which may not be eligible for price protection.
​
We believe that we have excellent relationships with our vendors. We generally pay vendors within stated terms, or earlier when favorable cash discounts are offered. We believe our high volume of purchases enables us to obtain product pricing and terms that are competitive with those available to other national IT solutions providers. Although brand names and individual product offerings are important to our business, we believe that competitive products are available in substantially all of the merchandise categories offered by us.

DISTRIBUTION
​
We fulfill orders from customers both from products we hold in inventory and through drop shipping arrangements with manufacturers and distributors. At our 268,000 square foot technology TIDC in Wilmington, Ohio, we receive and ship inventory, configure and integrate technology solutions, provide depot maintenance and services, and process returned products. The TIDC features a state-of-the-art ISO 9001:2015-certified Configuration Lab that completed more than 500,000 custom configurations in 2022—including personal computing devices, servers, mobile devices, and networking hardware. Our technicians maintain extensive certifications and authorizations from all major manufacturers, with more than 90% of the TIDC team holding one or more CompTIA certifications. Through the TIDC, we are able to offer customers turnkey solutions for all of their IT needs, including hardware configuration, imaging and provisioning, asset management, remote management, white glove enrollment services, kitting, custom packaging, and depot repair services.
​
We also place product orders directly with manufacturers and/or distribution companies for drop shipment directly to our customers. Order status with distributors is tracked online and a confirmation of shipment from manufacturers and/or distribution companies is received prior to initial recording of the transaction. Products drop shipped by suppliers were 71%, 72%, and 76%, of net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Electronic delivery for software licenses were approximately 9%, 10%, and 11% of total net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
​
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
​
Our subsidiaries utilize management information systems which have been significantly customized for our use. These systems permit centralized management of key functions, including order taking and processing, inventory and accounts receivable management, purchasing, sales, and distribution, and the preparation of daily operating control reports on key aspects of the business. We also operate advanced telecommunications equipment to support our sales and customer service operations. Key elements of the telecommunications systems are integrated with our computer systems to provide timely customer information to sales and service representatives, and to facilitate the preparation of operating and performance data.
​
Our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems to manage our inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell, and ship our products efficiently and on a timely basis, and to maintain cost-efficient operations. We expect to continue upgrading our information systems in the future to more effectively manage our operations and customer database.
​
Our investments in IT systems and infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to provide our customers enhanced functionality.
​
COMPETITION
​
The direct marketing and sale of IT-related products is highly competitive. We compete with other national solutions providers of IT products, including CDW Corporation, SHI, and Insight Enterprises, Inc., who are the current leaders in the space. We also compete with:
​

● | certain product manufacturers that sell directly to customers as well as some of our own suppliers, such as Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo;

Additional competition may arise if other new methods of distribution emerge in the future. We compete not only for customers, but also for favorable product allocations and cooperative advertising support from product manufacturers. Several of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources. These and other factors related to our competitive position are discussed more fully in the “Overview” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Substantial competition could reduce our market share and may negatively affect our business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
We believe that price, product selection and availability, solutions capabilities, and service and support are the most important competitive factors in our industry.

REGULATORY MATTERS
​

​
 The U.S. federal government routinely revises its procurement practices and adopts new contract statutes, rules and regulations. The U.S. federal government has a broad range of tools available to enforce its procurement law and policies. These include debarring or suspending a particular contractor, certain of its operations and/ or individual employees from future government business. Individuals, on behalf of the federal government, may also bring qui tam suits against us for any alleged fraud related to payments under a U.S. federal government contract or program.
 Moreover, The U.S. federal government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. In the event of termination of a contract for convenience, a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the remaining profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on a related contract. A termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.
​
Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices
​
 Under applicable federal and state laws, we are required to comply with a number of requirements when sending commercial email or making telephone calls to consumers. For example, under applicable federal and state unfair competition laws, including the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and U.S. Federal Trade Commission, regulations, we must accurately identify product offerings, not make misleading claims on our platforms, and use qualifying disclosures where and when appropriate when distributing commercial emails to consumers. We are also subject to the Federal Telecommunications Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, which generally limit the consumers and types of communications we can make via telephone, text, automatic telephone dialing systems, and artificial and prerecorded voices.
​
Data Privacy and Security
​
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-US laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act govern the privacy and security of personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may 

12



conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
​
HUMAN CAPITAL 
​
 Our culture is reflected through our employees, who are driven to serve our customers, our partners, our communities and all of our stakeholders. We provide our employees with diverse experiences, training, and engagement opportunities to build a stronger team. Our culture—and the employees who share that culture with our customers and communities—are essential to our success and our ability to attract and retain top talent. Our Connection Cares initiative, launched in 2021, builds on the company’s long history of inclusivity and social responsibility with working groups focused on key areas: employee recognition, charitable giving, sustainability, and diversity and inclusion. Employees volunteer within these groups to share their ideas, conduct company-wide campaigns, and make a positive impact within our team and our wider community. These activities, and the formal structure to support them, help ensure we are able to offer the work environment and corporate culture that today’s workforce demands.
 We focus on the following key areas in hiring and developing our employees:
​

● | Training and Development. We focus on skills enhancement, leadership development, innovation excellence and professional growth throughout our employees’ careers. Our leadership program provides leadership trainings to our high-potential emerging leaders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Total Rewards. We provide market competitive compensation aligned with company performance. We further align our sales representatives’ compensation to their individual performance by providing excellent commission opportunities. We provide a comprehensive benefits package to our employees, including healthcare, retirement plans with Company’s match, tuition assistance, inclusive parental leave policies, adoption assistance, paid time off, paid volunteer hours and philanthropic match programs based upon eligibility and location.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Oversight and Management. Our Board of Directors understands the importance of our inclusive, performance-driven culture to our ongoing success and is actively engaged with our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President of Human Resources across a broad range of human capital management topics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
