Item 1. Business 

The Company
We are building the next generation experience for e-commerce. By investing for the long term with a fanatical culture of customer centricity, we believe we are delivering a superior customer experience at a lower cost and continue to redefine standards for e-commerce worldwide. Our efforts have centered on building an end-to-end integrated system of technology and infrastructure, and most importantly, an innovation-focused culture driven to raise our customers’ expectations and lead them to wonder “How did I ever live without Coupang?”
On March 2, 2022, we announced that management revised its reportable segments to reflect the way we now manage our business and to promote improved visibility to our business performance. The change led to the following two reportable segments: 
•Product Commerce, which primarily includes our core retail (owned inventory) and marketplace offerings (third-party merchants) and Rocket Fresh, our fresh grocery offering, as well as advertising products associated with these offerings; and 
•Developing Offerings, which primarily includes our more nascent offerings and services, including Coupang Eats, our restaurant ordering and delivery service, Coupang Play, our online content streaming service, fintech, certain international initiatives, as well as advertising products associated with these offerings. 
Our Customer Experience
We are committed to delivering a “wow” experience to all of our customers every day. In order to improve the customer experience with end-to-end control, we launched our owned-inventory selection. Through this, we offer our customers a wide selection of general merchandise ranging from consumer electronics to personal care. We reimagined the e-commerce experience with our Rocket Delivery service:
•Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Orders are delivered within hours via Dawn Delivery (ordered as late as midnight, arrive before 7am) or Same-Day Delivery (ordered in the morning, arrive same-day).
•Next-Day Delivery. Customers are eligible for free, one-day delivery nationwide 365 days a year.
•Frictionless Returns. Our customers simply tap a button on the app and leave the item outside their door for pickup. Refunds are initiated the moment the item is picked up at the door.
In addition to Rocket Delivery available to all our customers, our Rocket WOW membership program allows members to enjoy unlimited free shipping with no minimum spend, free unlimited returns for 30 days, delivery of groceries via Rocket Fresh, and content streaming on Coupang Play. We’ve also extended our network and systems to other offerings that further improve our customers’ lives such as our restaurant ordering and delivery services from Coupang Eats. We believe the success of these offerings demonstrates the power of our network to extend offerings to our loyal customers.
Our Merchant Experience
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on Coupang form an essential part of our business, and we strive to be a growth driver for these companies through our win-win model. Over 70% of Coupang merchants are SMEs, which can leverage our nationwide fulfillment and logistics infrastructure to connect with millions of customers. We’ve supported these SMEs, helping them in everything from marketing and logistics to customer service. We also continue to develop new ways for SMEs to unlock growth through Coupang, such as Coupang Private Label Brands, through which we work mostly with SMEs to develop and market high-quality products for customers marketed under our private label brand, at affordable prices. We also recently launched Rocket Overseas to customers in Taiwan, empowering SME partners to unlock even more growth through sales to customers outside of Korea, at no additional effort or cost on their part.
Advertising
In addition to our e-commerce services, we also have offerings for our suppliers and merchants to advertise on our websites and mobile applications.
Our Competition
We compete with: (1) offline, online, and omnichannel retailers, suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in

Seasonality
Typically, we see peak order volumes in and around the first and fourth quarters, which include major holidays.
Human Capital
Our global team of employees is the driving force in creating a one-of-a-kind experience for millions of customers. In the same way our employees aim to go above and beyond for our customers, we aim to go above and beyond for them. As one of the largest private sector employers in South Korea, we directly employ approximately 63,000 employees as of December 31, 2022. We believe our direct employment model, along with competitive wages, training and safety programs, and a broad range of comprehensive benefits, empowers our diverse set of employees to deliver the “wow” experiences for our customers we strive to create every day.
Most of our employees are frontline workers in our fulfillment and logistics operations, and we make their health, safety, and wellness a top priority. We've made significant investments in health and safety initiatives that helped strengthen our leading safety record, which is one of the best in the Korean logistics industry and globally1. These investments include Coupang Care, the first paid health promotion program of its kind at scale for logistics workers in Korea. We believe the well-being of our employees is directly tied to the success of our business, and most importantly, our impact on our customers. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
We have trademark rights in our name and other brand indicia and have trademark registrations for select marks in Korea, the United States, and other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.aboutcoupang.com and similar variations. 
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including technical and administrative security controls and contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. 
Our design logos, “Coupang,” and our other registered or common law trademarks, service marks, or trade names appearing in this Form 10-K are our property or our affiliates’ property. Other trade names, trademarks, and service marks used in this Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.
Government Regulation
Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to a number of national, state/region, and local laws, standards and regulations in Korea, the U.S., China, and other countries where we operate. These laws and regulations involve matters that are central to our business, including our interactions with customers, suppliers, and merchants. These laws and regulations involve fair trade, competition, labor and employment, privacy, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, import and export regulations, and other subjects. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.
