 Item 1. Business
Who We Are
Bumble app was founded because we noticed two different, yet related issues in our society: antiquated gender norms, and a lack of kindness and accountability on the internet. We observed that women were often treated unequally in society, especially in romantic relationships. At the same time, social networks created possibilities for connections, but they were focused on connections with people you already know and lacked guardrails to encourage better behavior online.
We created Bumble app to change this. The Bumble brand was built with women at the center—where women make the first move. Our platform is designed to be safe and empowering for women, and, in turn, provides a better environment for everyone. We are leveraging innovative technology solutions to create a more inclusive, safe and accountable way to connect online for all users regardless of gender.
Bumble’s mission is to create a world where all relationships are healthy and equitable, through Kind Connections. Our platform enables people to connect and build healthy and equitable relationships on their own terms. We focus on building authenticity and safety in the online space, which is marked at times by isolation and toxicity. We also believe there is a significant opportunity to extend our platform beyond online dating into healthy relationships across all areas of life: love, friendships, careers and beyond. By empowering women across all of their relationships, we believe that we have the potential to become a preeminent global women’s brand.
In 2022, we operated three apps, Bumble app, Badoo app and Fruitz app, where during 2022, on average, over 40 million users came on a monthly basis to discover new people and connect with each other in a safe, secure and empowering environment. Bumble app, Badoo app and Fruitz app monetize via a freemium model, where the use of the service is free and a subset of the users pay for subscriptions or in-app purchases to access premium features. We are a leader in the online dating space, which has become increasingly popular over the last decade and has been cited as the most common way for new couples to meet in the United States.
 The Bumble and Badoo apps ranked among the top five grossing iOS lifestyle apps in 109 and 99 countries, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.
•Bumble app, launched in 2014, is one of the first dating apps built with women at the center. On Bumble app, women make the first move. Bumble app is a leader in the online dating sector across several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. We had approximately 2.0 million Bumble App Paying Users during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 •Badoo app, launched in 2006, was one of the pioneers of web and mobile free-to-use dating products. Badoo app’s focus is to make finding meaningful connections easy, fun and accessible for a mainstream global audience. Badoo app continues to be a market leader in Europe and Latin America. We had approximately 1.2 million Badoo App and Other Paying Users during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 In January 2022, we acquired Fruitz, a fast-growing dating app with a Gen Z focus, which is a growing segment of online dating consumers. Fruitz app was the second most downloaded dating app in France, its core market, during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Bumble is more than our apps—we are powering a movement. Our mission-first strategy ensures that values guide our business decisions and our business performance enables us to drive impact. Our strategy is anchored by our powerful brand, product leadership, operational excellence and impact initiatives. Examples of how our mission drives our business include:
•We enhance our brand through impact initiatives beyond our apps, including advocating for legislative solutions to prohibit nonconsensual intimate image abuse and other online harms, including unsolicited lewd photos.
 •We engage in worldwide nonprofit partnerships to support healthy, safe, and equitable relationships, and to elevate women and other underrepresented communities.
 •We enhance our brand through marketing campaigns centered around elevating women, including the “Be the CEO Your Parents Wanted You to Marry” and “Believe Women” campaigns.
 We believe that the best way to compete in a world where people have multiple ways to connect is through product innovation. We uniquely design our products to facilitate engagement prioritizing safety and accountability across the user experience. We continuously collect user feedback, which informs our product development roadmap. The more we know about our community’s interests, the better we can innovate products that maximize their chances of making connections most likely to turn into the relationships they are seeking. Our apps share some common infrastructure, which allows insights to be shared between apps.

Our shared infrastructure is also critical to providing our users with personalized and superior experiences. Our team has a strong track record of product leadership in online dating. We were the first company in the dating app industry to develop technology to proactively blur lewd photos shared within a chat, which Bumble recently open-sourced for the technology community as part of a larger effort to help rid the internet of "cyberflashing," the sharing of unsolicited lewd photos online. In addition, the insights we have gained from our community have encouraged us to extend Bumble app into many more areas of life, such as platonic friendships and business networking, and we have built our platform with the flexibility to pursue these opportunities.
Our Technology Has Transformed Online Dating
 Technology is at the core of what differentiates our platform. We have a global team of software engineers and product managers who drive the development of our platform. We release live updates rapidly, often once a week to our mobile app and twice a day to our server backend, allowing us to run dozens of tests simultaneously across the entire audience. The rapid nature of our testing framework allows us to optimize the user experience. Our technology and product teams work hand in hand from ideation to product launch, and this has allowed us to be at the forefront of releasing features geared towards improving the safety of our community.
Our technology platform is fueled by:
•Shared infrastructure: Our apps share some common infrastructure, which allows insights to be shared between apps. This allows us to quickly test new features, provides us with flexibility to migrate features from one app to another where appropriate, and improves execution at scale by driving faster improvements in our apps, while simultaneously driving operating efficiencies by reducing the cost of launching new features. Given our shared infrastructure, we can also innovate and scale efficiently as we enter new geographies and new categories outside online dating. Moreover, in seeking to acquire companies, we look for opportunities to leverage our shared infrastructure (for example, our content moderation capabilities) to accelerate their product roadmap.
 •Our data and machine learning capabilities: We are continually analyzing data from user interactions on our platform, allowing us to constantly optimize the user experience. We have machine and deep learning capabilities that we leverage to personalize the potential matches we display, inform our product pipeline and otherwise tailor the experience for specific users. Our machine and deep learning capabilities plays a key role in identity fraud prevention as well as blocking inappropriate behavior and content from polluting our platform.
 •Our data protection and privacy standards: We are both committed and mandated to adhere to strict privacy standards.
 Bumble App
Profile, Matching and Chatting
Setting up a profile on Bumble app is easy. First, users input information about themselves, including their name, age, gender identity, sexual orientation / who they are looking for, and a photo. In addition, we offer multiple ways for users to add customization and detail to their profiles. Users can also add Badges to their profiles, which allows a user to prominently display certain values or characteristics, ranging from religion, to preference around having children, to zodiac sign. We also enable enhanced personalization of your profile, through integration with Spotify and Instagram. The profile set up includes features geared towards our users’ safety—for example, by encouraging additional photographs, verifying their profile, and offering filters to search for other verified users to protect themselves from “catfishing” or profiles with false identities. We require all users to review our community guidelines which include items such as respecting all users regardless of their identity and only uploading your own photos.
 We use a matching algorithm combined with the preferences provided by users to recommend potential connections. Users can opt to use one of our filters to be more specific in the types of matches they see. A user can swipe right to vote “yes” to a potential match, or left to go to the next profile, or, in most of our markets, leave a compliment on a specific photo or profile prompt on someone’s profile. When both users vote yes, a connection is made. After an initial match is formed, users on Bumble app must initiate a chat within 24 hours or the connection disappears. As our motto implies, women make the first move by initiating a chat in a heterosexual connection. Free users can extend one match per day by adding another 24 hours to the countdown. We offer our users multiple mediums to engage with their matches, including through voice chat, video chatting, voice recordings, or GIFs—animated images.

These features not only enrich the conversation but also improve safety by allowing added layers of verification and interactions prior to meeting in person. Users can also opt to play our Question Game which asks both users in a match the same question.
 Safety
The safety and security of our users is a key priority. In addition to prioritizing verification of users and offering communication like voice and video chat tools to allow interactions before or in lieu of in-person meeting without exchanging sensitive personal information, we have also engineered other safety features such as our proactive safety monitoring. This feature uses machine learning to identify harassment and identity-based hate, which is then flagged to moderators to review and action appropriately according to our Community Guidelines. Our Safety Center is an in-app section with advice around safety and security, standards of behavior, how to report unwanted behavior, and other information about how Bumble app maintains safety. We also prioritize mental health by offering options such as Snooze, which temporarily hides a user’s profile to potential matches allowing users to take a break from the platform, without losing their match history or profile details.
Premium Features
Our subscription offerings, Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium, provide users with additional features to increase their success making a meaningful connection. We offer users flexible subscription plans, and the most common lengths are 7-day, 30-day and 90-day. The most popular features included in the subscription plans are:
•Beeline: The Beeline shows you who likes you - potential suitors who have already voted yes on the user, but on which the user has not yet voted one way or another. Bumble Premium subscribers are not only able to see the Beeline, but they can also apply their filters for a more curated experience. 
 •Rematch: Allows Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium subscribers to rematch with any of the prior matches that have already expired after a 24-hour period. 
 •Extend: Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium subscribers have an unlimited number of 24-hour extensions on conversations. 
 •Travel Mode: Users can change their location to anywhere in the world, opening up potential matches in new geographies rather than just nearby.
 •Incognito Mode: Users can swipe privately by initially hiding their profile from other users and then only appearing for those whom they have swiped right on.
 There are also additional, in-app purchases that subscribers and non-subscribing users can purchase. Some of these features are included in Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium, whereas most are additional features we offer on top of the subscription platform. Some of these additional in-app purchases include:
•SuperSwipe: Users can use SuperSwipe to inform potential matches that they are confidently interested in them, whereas typically a yes vote is anonymous until both matches vote yes. 
 •Spotlight: Users can use Spotlight to advance their profile to the top of the list of potential matches so it is viewable by more potential matches instantly. 
 •Compliments: In most of our markets, users can purchase more Compliments to send a kind reaction to another user’s bio, photo, or profile prompt, which allows the sender to stand out and be intentional about starting a conversation in a positive way.
 Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz
In addition to dating, we also provide products that enable social connection, offering users the opportunity to develop platonic connections through Bumble BFF for friendships and through Bumble Bizz for professional networking and mentorship. Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz have a format similar to Bumble Date, requiring users to set up profiles and matching users through “yes” and “no” votes, similar to the dating platform.

Badoo App
Profile, Matching and Chatting
Badoo app’s profile customizations include the ability to add photos, work or educational background, and other personal information such as height and religion. We also allow profile videos on Badoo app. In addition, users can use the "Moods" feature to share what's on their minds. This can either be based around their current emotions or what kind of date they want to pursue. Another unique feature of Badoo app is the My Interests feature, which allows users to highlight certain topics by entering words or multiple words that are then displayed on the users’ profiles.
Badoo app has a similar matching algorithm to Bumble app and the same vote “yes” or “no” methodology by swiping right and left, respectively. However, Badoo app also has a “People Nearby” feature which allows users to see all potential connections nearby. Unlike on Bumble app, where messaging is restricted until both users vote yes, Badoo app allows users the option to directly message anyone who is of interest without having to mutually vote yes. Badoo app also has a Bumped Into feature, which connects people who are frequently in nearby vicinity. Badoo app's messaging capabilities include GIFs, gift giving, photos, audio, voice calls, and video calls.
Safety
 On Badoo app we continually invest in the safety and security of our users. Similar to Bumble app, Badoo app prioritizes verification of users and offering communication like voice and video chat tools to allow interactions before or in lieu of in-person meeting without exchanging sensitive personal information. We have also engineered other safety features such as Rude Message Detector, which uses machine learning to detect any text that could be perceived as rude, abusive, homophobic or discriminatory and gives the user the control to dismiss the message if they are not comfortable with the language used.
 Premium Features
Our premium subscription offerings on Badoo app are Badoo Premium and Badoo Premium Plus. Badoo Premium allows additional features such as:
•Liked You: Allows users to find out who has already liked them. 
 •Invisible Mode: Allows users to browse the app without being shown to other users.
 •Undo Vote: Undoes a “no” vote on a potential match. 
 The Badoo Premium Plus subscription includes weekly or daily allowances of features such as:
 •Chat with anyone: Users can unlock additional chats each week.
 •Extra Shows: Users are seen by more people with an Extra Show each week. 
 •Crush: Users can inform potential matches that they are confidently interested in them. 
 These subscription plans also offer flexible packages, similar to on Bumble app. Badoo app also offers Badoo Credits, which can be purchased in bundles and used to acquire in-app features such as one-off popularity boosts.
Fruitz App
 Fruitz app requires all users to select a profile fruit to symbolize their dating intention: cherries for those seeking a serious relationship, grapes for those looking to date, watermelons for those who are not seeking anything serious, and peaches for those looking for a casual relationship. This simple feature normalizes the notion of users disclosing their dating intentions from the first touchpoint with any user, encouraging honesty and transparency.
On Fruitz app, the safety and security of our users is paramount. Fruitz leverages shared infrastructure from the Bumble and Badoo apps for photo moderation.
Fruitz app's premium subscription offerings are Fruitz Premium and Fruitz Golden. Premium features include: Filter by Fruit, which enables users to filter other users by their dating intention, represented by their fruit, and Who Liked Me, which allows users to see who has already liked them.
 How We Grow Our Community
We are investing in growing our community by building our apps as distinct brands with complementary but unique user value propositions. For Bumble app, we educate audiences on how women making the first move creates healthier relationships across love,

friendship, and business. Badoo app is about helping people overcome the self-doubt they might feel, to open themselves up to others, embrace the journey of meeting people to figure out what they want. Fruitz app is about encouraging honesty and transparency through the disclosure of dating intentions at the outset.
 Each of our apps has a specific brand and marketing approach that is appropriate for its business model, stage of maturity and local market nuances. For example, our Bumble app marketing uses hyperlocal messaging brought to life through large-scale campaigns alongside grassroots community building based on our core audience's location.
Our brands’ marketing strategies are especially effective due to our centralized performance marketing, partnership, and creative functions. These centralized functions enable us to share marketing learnings across our apps and geographies, allowing for the broadest application of successful strategies.
 Our Impact
Since the founding of Bumble app, we have established, engaged in, and supported a wide range of social impact efforts to further our mission, primarily focused on women’s empowerment, healthy relationship education, and the reduction in toxicity on our platform and society at large. These include:
•Engaging Experts to Make our Platform Safe: We leverage both internal and external experts to continuously improve upon our policies and community guidelines. For example, we are a member of the Technology Coalition, an industry body that shares best practices to combat child sexual exploitation online.
 •In-App Integration of Bumble Initiatives: The Moves Making Impact product feature within Bumble app allows users to select a cause that matters to them. Then, each time that user sends a first message, Bumble donates to a woman in the Vital Voices Global Partnership network aligned with that cause. Through this partnership, Bumble has donated to causes ranging from supporting transgender people in India to women in the U.S. workplace.
 •Policy Advocacy and Legislation Efforts: We are continuing our focus on efforts to combat the sending of unsolicited lewd photos. In 2019, we helped pass one of the first state-level laws to address the act of sending unsolicited lewd photos in Texas. We have since helped pass similar legislation in California and Virginia and are supporting similar legislation in New York and Washington D.C. In 2021, we launched a campaign in the UK to support the enactment of a law that makes the unsolicited sending of nude images illegal. Our campaign garnered widespread attention from the media and government, which announced that it is considering how to best legislate a new criminal offense to address cyberflashing. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2022, we contributed the source code for our Private Detector AI feature, which flags unsolicited nude photos, to the open source community in an effort to help others combat cyberflashing.
 •Healthy Relationships: Bumble is a multi-year partner of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, with a shared commitment to help empower people across the United States to create healthy and equitable relationships both online and in real life.
 •Philanthropic Partnerships Program: We aim to build meaningful partnerships that support our mission, inform our products, bolster the safety and wellbeing of our community, and engage our employees. 
 Human Capital
Our company culture and people practices are critical to achieving our mission of creating a world where all relationships are healthy and equitable, and our values are rooted in growth, kindness, equity, accountability and honesty.
Diversity & Inclusion
 The diversity of our management team and workforce is key to our success and reflects our mission and values. We strongly encourage people of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and non-binary people, veterans, and individuals with disabilities to apply to work with us. We seek to be fully reflective of the communities we serve around the world. As of the date of this Annual Report, 73% of our Board and more than 50% of our management team are women. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 950 full-time employees, of which approximately 770 are located outside of the United States.
We are focused on building an inclusive culture and sustaining a diverse workforce through a variety of company initiatives. As part of that effort, we have established several employee resource groups (“ERG”s), each with a mission of bringing our employees together, collectively learning, sharing meaningful experiences, addressing challenges, providing access to supportive services and building inclusive communities within Bumble. At the center of this initiative is Diversibees, an intersectional, employee-led organization consisting of more than 300 employees. Single-identity affinity groups come together under the Diversibees umbrella.

Our ERGs sponsor many initiatives throughout the year, which build community and advocacy through workshops, newsletters, listening circles, leadership development and other training programs, and cultural celebrations.
 Other company initiatives include: continuing to expand the role of our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Center of Excellence, setting workforce representation goals, providing diversity and inclusion training to all employees, and continuing our investment in the Bumble Tech Academy graduates, which encourages and supports the transition of talent from underrepresented groups and communities to the tech sector.
 Talent Acquisition, Development & Retention
 We compete to attract and retain highly talented individuals, particularly people with expertise in computer science, software engineering, product development, data science and engineering and machine learning. Our ability to recruit top talent is driven by our mission-first orientation, meaningful and impactful work, commitment to employee development, health and wellbeing and our brands’ reputation.
 We invest in development to help employees grow and build their careers. We sponsor training, education and leadership development opportunities for our employees designed to provide them with the knowledge, skills and habits necessary to succeed in their jobs and careers. In 2022, we optimized our performance evaluation processes and piloted a manager development program, which we plan to expand to all managers in 2023.
 To build an organization where employees feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to employees’ feedback in a variety of ways, including through periodic employee engagement surveys, new joiner surveys, one-on-one interactions, and regular "All Hands" meetings that bring the entire company together. Participation in our most recent employee engagement survey was active, with approximately seven in ten employees completing the survey. We maintain open lines of communication to help us understand our employees’ needs so that we can continuously improve as an employer of choice for our current and future employees.
Benefits, Safety & Wellbeing
 The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the wellbeing of our people. We continue to invest in benefits that help our employees, support our mission, and align with market practice across five key health pillars: physical, mental, financial, family, and social.
 We offer a competitive benefits package, which includes access to private healthcare coverage for employees and their families, paid six-month leave for parents regardless of gender, path to parenthood support, unlimited paid time off, and paid leave for survivors of domestic violence or violent crimes. We also invest in initiatives for financial and retirement planning.
 The safety of our employees remains among our top priorities. We regularly engage a mental health liaison to work with our internal safety team, host benefit sessions on topics of safety, and offer mental healthcare resources to employees.
 Competition The online dating industry is fast growing and highly competitive. We compete with a number of companies that provide dating products and services for the same markets in which we operate, including other online dating platforms and social media platforms that offer dating features. However, online dating is not a winner-take-all market, with users on average using two different apps at the same time—and very few competitors operate at our scale or level of brand awareness. In addition, we compete with offline dating services, such as in-person matchmakers, as well as more traditional forms of dating that involve people meeting offline without the use of dating products or services altogether. Because of the extensibility of the Bumble app platform beyond dating, we also compete with social media and networking platforms in that context.
 Intellectual Property
We believe that our rights in our intellectual property, including patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology, are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from our competitors. We own a number of trademarks that have been registered, or for which registration applications are pending, in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks include, among others, BUMBLE, BADOO and FRUITZ. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar services and goods. We expect to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective.

In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous domain names, including www.bumble.com, and patents and designs for various product features. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect our inventions, trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further protect the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions. For information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology Systems and Intellectual Property.”
Seasonality
We experience seasonality in user growth, user engagement, Paying User growth, and monetization on our platform. Historically, we have seen an increase in all of these metrics in January due in part to seasonal demand in the lead up to Valentine’s Day, and during the Northern Hemisphere summer. Generally, our highest performing months for user growth and user engagement are during the first and third quarters of the fiscal year, and our highest performing months for Total Paying Users are in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year.
Licensing and Regulation
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and around the world that involve matters central to our business. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws may relate to privacy, data protection and personal information, online safety, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption law compliance, securities law compliance, online payment services, and labor and employment. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data and we currently, and from time to time, may not be in technical compliance with all such laws. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and difficult to predict, particularly in the rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
 Proposed, new and evolving legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the implications of the European Union (“EU”) and United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation (collectively referred to as “GDPR”), which applies to our products and services, are far-reaching and constantly evolving. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that are established in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, respectively, and for companies that receive or process personal data of individuals located in those jurisdictions, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition to the GDPR, there are a number of legislative proposals in the EU as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. There are other privacy and data protection laws and regulations that impact the products and services we offer to users in different countries. In the United States, there are a number of state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, “CCPA”), modified the legal regime in California, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, and created a new state agency, the first of its kind in the United States, which is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA. There are other U.S. states that have passed comprehensive privacy laws that have either come into force – Virginia – or will come into force later this year – Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah, or that have pending privacy bills in their respective legislatures. At a national level in the United States, Congress may pass a comprehensive federal privacy statute and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission are increasing their enforcement efforts and considering adopting new privacy rules. New privacy laws or regulations are likely to grant enhanced privacy rights to individuals and impose obligations on us as a business operating in those jurisdictions. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. For information regarding risks related to these compliance requirements, please see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation—We must comply with rapidly-evolving privacy and data protection laws across jurisdictions, and the failure to do so could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.”
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for information regarding how actions by regulatory

authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 In connection with our IPO, we elected to be an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. An EGC is defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.235 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. A company will retain its EGC status until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which it exceeds $1.235 billion in annual gross revenues; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date it first sold securities pursuant to an initial public offering registration statement; (3) the date on which the EGC has, within the previous three years, issued $1 billion of nonconvertible debt; or (4) the date it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million).
 Effective December 31, 2022, we are a large accelerated filer and accordingly are no longer an EGC.
