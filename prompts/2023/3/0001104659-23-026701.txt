Our goal is to build a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. We believe our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product.
Our future success depends upon many factors, including our ability, and that of any licensees and collaborators that we may have, to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our drug candidates. We have had no commercial revenues from sales of our drug candidates, and we have had a history of operating losses. It is possible that we may not be able to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our drug candidates, and we are subject to a number of risks that you should be aware of before investing in us. These risks are described more fully in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Clinical Development Programs
Barzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159)
Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and potently inhibits its activity. KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, and its activation by its ligand SCF regulates mast cell growth, differentiation, survival, chemotaxis and degranulation. Barzolvolimab is designed to block KIT activation by disrupting both SCF binding and KIT dimerization. We believe that by targeting KIT, barzolvolimab may be able to inhibit mast cell activity and decrease mast cell numbers to provide potential clinical benefit in mast cell related diseases.

In certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. In June 2020, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose escalation Phase 1a study of barzolvolimab in healthy subjects (n = 32; 8 subjects per cohort, 6 barzolvolimab; 2 placebo). Subjects received a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 9.0 mg/kg or placebo. The objectives of the study included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (tryptase and stem cell factor) and immunogenicity. Tryptase is an enzyme synthesized and secreted almost exclusively by mast cells and decreases in plasma tryptase levels are believed to reflect a systemic reduction in mast cell burden in both healthy volunteers and in disease. Data from the study were featured in a late breaking presentation at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress 2020 in June. Barzolvolimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile as well as profound and durable reductions of plasma tryptase, consistent with systemic mast cell suppression.
These data supported expansion of the barzolvolimab program into mast cell driven diseases, including initially in CSU and CIndU, diseases where mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Phase 1 studies in CSU and CIndU are completing and Phase 2 studies are ongoing. We continue to assess potential opportunities for barzolvolimab in other diseases where mast cells play an important role, such as dermatologic, respiratory, allergic, gastrointestinal and ophthalmic conditions and to this end, are conducting an ongoing Phase 1 study in prurigo nodularis and plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in eosinophilic esophagitis in the first half of 2023. Phase 1 studies of barzolvolimab have been conducted with an intravenous formulation; a subcutaneous formulation has been successfully developed and is being used in Phase 2 studies.
Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)
CSU presents as itchy hives, angioedema or both for at least six weeks without a specific trigger; multiple episodes can play out over years or even decades. CSU is one of the most frequent dermatologic diseases with a prevalence of 0.5-1.0% of the total population or up to approximately 1 to 3 million patients in the United States (Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org). Approximately 50% of patients with CSU achieve symptomatic control with antihistamines. Omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, provides relief for roughly half of the remaining antihistamine refractory patients. Consequently, there is a need for additional therapies.
In October 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b multi-center study of barzolvolimab in CSU. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety of multiple ascending doses of barzolvolimab in up to 40 patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with antihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels and clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response) as well as quality of life assessments. Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously (0.5, 1.5, 3 and 4.5 mg/kg at varying dosing schedules) as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor agonists.
In February 2023, we reported positive interim data from the CSU study. As of the data cut-off date on November 29, 2022, enrollment was complete with 45 patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines enrolled and treated [35 barzolvolimab (n=9 in 0.5 mg/kg; n=8 in 1.5 mg/kg; n=9 in 3.0 mg/kg; n=9 in 4.5 mg/kg) and 10 placebo]. The 0.5 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg cohorts had completed study participation through 24 weeks; 6 of 9 patients in the 4.5 mg/kg cohort had completed through the week 20 visit. Complete data were included for all patients in dose levels through 3.0 mg/kg through 24 weeks. All available data for the 4.5 mg/kg and placebo dose levels were presented for adverse events. Activity data for the 4.5 mg/kg dose level were reported through week 20. Activity data for the 0.5 mg/kg and placebo group were only included through week 12 because, as expected, most patients from these groups had significant symptoms ahead of week 24 and discontinued follow up. Two patients did not receive all doses of study treatment [4.5 mg/kg (1), placebo (1)].

● | Barzolvolimab resulted in rapid, marked and durable responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines, including patients with prior omalizumab treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The 1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg dose groups showed similar markedly improved urticaria symptoms and disease control with sustained durability up to 24 weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Mean reduction from baseline in urticaria activity (UAS7) at week 12 of 67% in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=8), 67% in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=9) and 82% in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group (n=9).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Complete response (UAS7=0) at week 12 of 57% in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, 44% in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group and 67% in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Well-controlled disease (UCT≥ 12) at week 12 of 75% in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, 63% in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group and 89% in the 4.5 mg/kg dose group.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | During post-treatment follow up, 7 of 8 (88%) patients who had been treated with barzolvolimab 1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg and had a complete response (UAS7=0) at week 12 maintained their complete response through 24 weeks. Two additional patients treated with these doses who were not a complete response at week 12 had a complete response at week 24. 6 of 6 (100%) patients treated with barzolvolimab 4.5 mg/kg maintained their complete response through their last assessment with additional follow up ongoing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with prior omalizumab therapy had similar symptom improvement as all patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapid onset of responses after initial dosing and sustained durability were observed; onset as early as 1 week after the first dose and prolonged symptom control in some patients for up to 24 weeks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tryptase suppression, indicative of mast cell depletion, paralleled symptom improvement, demonstrating the impact of mast cell depletion on CSU disease activity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Barzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile; effects of multiple dose administration were consistent with observations in single dose studies. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved while on study. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were hair color changes, COVID-19, headache, neutropenia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs and COVID-19 were reported as unrelated to treatment. There was one serious adverse event of salmonella gastroenteritis which was also not related to study therapy. Changes in hematologic parameters were consistent with observations in single dose studies, with no pattern of further decreases with multiple doses; hematologic values generally remained within the normal range and returned to baseline levels during the follow up period. Five patients had decreases in neutrophil counts reported as AEs; four of which were previously reported in the EAACI 2022 data presentation. The pattern observed in the neutrophil changes for these patients was similar to the pattern seen in patients across the barzolvolimab program to date—generally transient, asymptomatic, and mild and typically occurring in patients with screening and baseline neutrophil counts at the lower end of the normal range on study initiation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 2022, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy. The study is being conducted at approximately 75 sites across 9 countries. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of barzolvolimab to determine the optimal dosing strategy. Approximately 168 patients will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 75 mg every 4 weeks, 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a 16-week placebo-controlled treatment phase. Patients will then enter a 36-week active treatment phase, in which patients not already randomized to barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks or 300 mg every 8 weeks will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of these two dose regimens; patients already randomized to these treatment arms will remain on the same regimen as during the placebo-controlled treatment phase. Following the treatment period, patients will enter a 24-week follow up phase. The primary endpoint of the study is mean change in baseline to week 12 in UAS7 (Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days). Secondary endpoints include safety and other assessments of clinical activity including ISS7 (Itch Severity Score over 7 days), HSS7 (Hive Severity Score over 7 days) and AAS7 (Angioedema Activity Score over 7 days). Based on current enrollment projections, we anticipate that enrollment to this study will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and we plan to report topline data either late this year or in the first quarter of 2024.
Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU)
CIndUs are forms of urticaria that have an attributable cause or trigger associated with them, typically resulting in hives or wheals. The prevalence of CIndU is estimated at 0.5% of the total population and is reported to overlap in up to 36% of CSU patients

(Weller et al. 2010. Hautarzt. 61(8), Bartlett et al. 2018. DermNet.Org). There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers. We are exploring cold-induced, dermographism (scratch-induced) and cholinergic (exercise-induced) urticarias.
In December 2020, we announced that enrollment had opened and the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 1b study in CIndU being conducted in Germany in patients who are refractory to antihistamines. This study is an open label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety of a single dose (3 mg/kg) of barzolvolimab in patients with cold urticaria (ColdU) or symptomatic dermographism (SD). In March and June 2021, respectively, we added a third cohort (single dose, 3 mg/kg) in patients with cholinergic urticaria and a fourth cohort at a lower dose (single dose, 1.5 mg/kg) in ColdU. Patient’s symptoms are induced via provocation testing that resembles real life triggering situations. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including changes from baseline provocation thresholds, measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels, clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response), quality of life assessments and measurement of tissue mast cells through skin biopsies. Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously on Day 1 as add on treatment to H1-antihistamines.
In November 2022, data from the ColdU and SD cohorts treated with a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 3 mg/kg were published in Allergy (Terhorst-Molawi et al Allergy. 2022 Nov 16. doi: 10.1111/all.15585). Safety results were reported for 21 patients; activity results were reported for the 20 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab. Patients had high disease activity. At baseline, patients’ mean scores (range) for Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [10.8 (2–21)] and Urticaria Control Test (UCT) [6.0 (0–13)] indicated marked impairment of quality of life (QoL) and poorly controlled disease, respectively. Three patients (1 with ColdU and 2 with SD) were previously treated with omalizumab and chose to discontinue that treatment because they remained symptomatic. At baseline, provocation thresholds, on average (range), were 18.9°C or 66°F (5–27°C or 41–80.6°F) for patients with ColdU and 3.5 (2–4) pins for patients with SD.

● | Rapid (as early as 1 week) and durable responses were observed in all patients as assessed by provocation testing. A complete response was achieved in 95% (n = 19/20) of patients (n = 10/10 ColdU; n = 9/10 SD). The median duration (range) of complete response through the 12-week observation period was 77+ days (29–86; n = 10) for patients with ColdU and 57+ days (16–70; n = 9) for patients with SD. All three patients who experienced insufficient response to omalizumab treatment had a complete response after treatment with barzolvolimab.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following a single dose of barzolvolimab rapid improvements in urticaria control was observed. A UCT score of ≥12 (well controlled) was achieved by 80% (n = 16/20) of the patients within week 4 post-treatment. By week 8, all patients (100%; n = 20/20) achieved well-controlled urticaria, which was sustained to week 12 post-dose by 80% (n = 16/20) of patients. Complete urticaria control (UCT = 16) was achieved by 35% (n = 7/20), 65% (n = 13/20), and 40% (n = 8/20) at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At baseline, patients in both treatment groups reported disease impact on their QoL. Disease impact significantly decreased after dosing; a score of 0–1 (minimal/none) was achieved by 80% (n = 16/20) for all patients who completed the DLQI during the study. Additionally, clinically meaningful improvements in QoL were attained and sustained to week 12.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A single dose of barzolvolimab led to marked decreases in tryptase and in skin mast cells. The kinetics correlated with improvements in provocation testing and clinical activity, consistent with a central role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of ColdU and SD. This confirmed that serum tryptase level is a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker for assessing mast cell burden and clinical activity in inducible urticaria and potentially in other diseases with mast cell driven involvement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Barzolvolimab was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild, and the most common (≥3 patients) were hair color changes (76%; n = 16/21), infusion reactions (43%; n = 9/21), taste changes (38%; n = 8/21), nasopharyngitis (24%; n = 5/21), malaise (24%; n = 5/21), and headache (19%; n = 4/21). Hair color changes (generally small areas of hair color lightening) and taste disorders (generally partial changes of ability to taste salt or umami) are consistent with inhibiting KIT signaling in other cell types and completely resolved over time during follow-up. Infusion reactions, which manifested as localized hives and itching as well as erythema and feeling hot, resolved spontaneously. One patient with a history of fainting experienced loss of consciousness during infusion. The patient rapidly recovered. Importantly, no evidence of mast cell activation as measured by serum tryptase monitoring was observed in this patient. Overall, mean hematology parameters remained within the normal ranges—an important finding for a KIT inhibitor. Mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and white blood cell parameters occurred for some patients.

In December 2022, we presented long term follow up data from the 3.0 mg/kg cohorts in cold urticaria and symptomatic dermographism at the GA²LEN Global Urticaria Forum (GUF) 2022. 14 patients consented to the optional long term follow up evaluation (6 cold, 8 symptomatic dermographism); 10 of the 14 still had complete control of their disease as assessed by provocation testing at week 12. Data were collected at one or more timepoints beyond week 12 through week 36. 

● | Most patients had return of symptoms and/or loss of urticaria control between 12 and 36 weeks. Remarkably, two patients remained provocation negative at 36 weeks, and four had well controlled disease (UCT ≥12) 36 weeks post dosing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Serum tryptase exhibits a similar rate of recovery as clinical symptoms, while skin mast cells return at a slower rate. Tissue KIT signaling, as approximated by SCF levels, was rapidly inhibited after dose administration and fully reactivated approximately 18 weeks after dosing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tryptase levels return to pretreatment levels during follow up, while mast cells continue to recover. Drug related adverse events noted during the study all resolved.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In December 2022, we also presented 12 week treatment results for the 1.5 mg/kg cohort in cold urticaria at the GA²LEN Global Urticaria Forum (GUF) 2022. 10 patients received a single intravenous infusion of barzolvolimab at 1.5 mg/kg. Patients had high disease activity as assessed by provocation threshold testing with a mean baseline critical temperature threshold of 18.4°C or 65°F with a range from 6 to 27°C or 43 to 81°F. All patients had disease refractory to antihistamines and five patients had disease refractory to omalizumab. Safety results were reported for all 10 patients; activity results were reported for the 9 patients who received a full dose of barzolvolimab, including four patients with omalizumab refractory disease. 

● | All 9 of 9 (100%) patients evaluable for activity treated at 1.5 mg/kg experienced a complete response as assessed by provocation threshold testing, including 4 patients with disease refractory to omalizumab. Rapid onset of responses after dosing and sustained durability were observed in the 1.5 mg/kg cohort. 6 of 9 patients treated achieved a complete response within a week of dosing. The median duration of response was 51+ days (7+ weeks).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvements in disease activity as reported by Urticaria Control Test (UCT) were consistent with the complete responses as measured by provocation testing. All patients entered the study with poorly controlled disease (mean UCT score at baseline of 5.9 and a range of 1-11). Following barzolvolimab administration, all patients achieved well controlled disease (UCT>12) with 7 of 9 achieving complete control (UCT = 16).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A single 1.5 mg/kg dose of barzolvolimab resulted in rapid, marked and durable suppression of serum tryptase; the kinetics of tryptase depletion mirrored changes in provocation threshold and UCT. Barzolvolimab was generally well tolerated and the safety profile at 1.5mg/kg was similar to the profile observed with 3.0 mg/kg.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No new treatment emergent AEs of concern were noted. While mild, transient and asymptomatic decreases in hemoglobin and white blood cell (WBC) parameters were noted, consistent with prior studies, the hematology parameters generally remained within the normal range.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To date, 19 of 19 (100%) patients with cold urticaria treated with either a single dose of barzolvolimab at 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg in this Phase 1b study have experienced a complete response by provocation testing, including 5 patients with omalizumab refractory disease.
In July 2022 we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study in patients with CIndU who remain symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy. The study will be conducted at approximately 85 sites across approximately 12 countries. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of multiple dose regimens of barzolvolimab in patients with CIndU to determine the optimal dosing strategy. Approximately 180 patients in 2 cohorts (differentiated by CIndU subtype) including 90 patients with cold urticaria and 90 patients with symptomatic dermographism will be randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of barzolvolimab at 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 8 weeks or placebo during a 20-week treatment phase. Patients will then enter a follow-up phase for an additional 24 weeks. In addition, the study includes the option for patients who have symptoms following the treatment phase, including patients who were on placebo, to enroll in an open label extension where all patients receive 300 mg every 9 weeks of barzolvolimab. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of patients with a negative provocation test at week 12 (using TempTest(R) and FricTest(R)). Secondary endpoints include safety and other assessments of clinical activity including CTT (Critical Temperature Threshold), CFT (Critical Friction Threshold) and WI-NRS (Worst itch numeric rating scale).

Prurigo Nodularis (PN)
We have expanded clinical development of barzolvolimab into prurigo nodularis (PN). PN is a chronic skin disease characterized by the development of hard, intensely itchy (pruritic) nodules on the skin. Mast cells through their interactions with sensory neurons and other immune cells are believed to play an important role in amplifying chronic itch and neuroinflammation, both of which are a hallmark of PN. There is currently only one FDA approved therapy for PN, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry sources estimate there are approximately 154,000 patients in the United States with PN who have undergone treatment within the last 12 months and, of these, approximately 75,000 would be biologic-eligible. In December 2021, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1b multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intravenous study designed to assess the safety and treatment effects across multiple dosing cohorts of barzolvolimab in up to 30 patients with PN. Enrolling an intravenous, early stage study in the dermatology setting has been a challenge and the study has taken longer than expected to complete. In February 2023, we closed enrollment at 24 patients, which we believe will provide sufficient data for analysis to inform future development decisions in PN. Following the completion of the 24 week follow up period post dosing for patients on study, we plan to present data from the study in the second half of 2023. Potential future development in PN will utilize the subcutaneous formulation of barzolvolimab.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)
In February 2022, we announced that we will be expanding clinical development of barzolvolimab into eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the most common type of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease. EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils. This chronic inflammation can result in trouble swallowing, chest pain, vomiting and impaction of food in the esophagus, a medical emergency. Several studies have suggested that mast cells may be an important driver in the disease, demonstrating that the number and activation state of mast cells are greatly increased in EoE biopsies and that mast cell signatures correlate with markers of inflammation, fibrosis, pain and disease severity. Currently, there is only one FDA approved therapy for EoE, representing an area of significant unmet need. Industry sources estimate there are approximately 160,000 patients in the United States with EoE who have undergone treatment within the last 12 months and, of these, approximately 48,000 would be biologic-eligible. Given the lack of effective therapies for EoE and barzolvolimab’s potential as a mast cell depleting agent, we believe EoE is an important indication for future study and plan to initiate a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled subcutaneous study designed to assess the treatment effects and safety of barzolvolimab in patients with EoE in the first half of 2023.
Additional Barzolvolimab Development Activities
Manufacturing activities to support the introduction of the barzolvolimab subcutaneous formulation into the clinical program have been completed and, in September 2021, we initiated dosing in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety of single ascending doses of the subcutaneous formulation of barzolvolimab in healthy volunteers. In February 2022, we reported that subcutaneous administration of barzolvolimab was well tolerated and that multiple dose levels have been identified that possess promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Importantly, subcutaneous delivery of barzolvolimab resulted in dose-dependent, rapid and sustained decreases in serum tryptase compared with placebo and achieved sufficient exposure to produce tryptase suppression levels comparable with the levels that generated impressive clinical activity observed in the Phase 1 CIndU intravenous study. The Phase 2 multi-dose studies in urticaria are designed to evaluate 75 mg and 150 mg administered every 4 weeks and 300 mg administered every 8 weeks. These doses support a 0.5 to 2 ml injection volume, allowing for a single injection as barzolvolimab advances towards potential commercialization. In 2022, we initiated transfer of our current barzolvolimab manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization to support late-stage trials and to prepare for potential commercialization.
In February 2022, we reported interim data after completing the in-life dosing portion of our six-month chronic toxicology study in non-human primates. The only clinically adverse finding at the completion of dosing was a profound impact on spermatogenesis, an expected and well understood effect of KIT inhibition. As a standard part of toxicology studies, some animals from each group continued to be observed through a recovery period to understand the reversibility of any adverse findings. Due to the very high concentrations of barzolvolimab at the end of dosing, the recovery period was approximately one year. As we expected, and consistent with previous findings with KIT blocking antibodies, we were pleased to report in December 2022, that during this recovery period spermatogenesis fully recovered in all male animals as measured by both sperm count and motility. We expect the final histologic analysis and study report in early 2023. We are encouraged with these findings and believe these data strongly support our Phase 2 studies in urticaria and in future indications.

Bispecific Platform
Our next generation bispecific antibody platform is supporting the expansion of our pipeline with additional candidates for inflammatory diseases and oncology. Targets are being selected based on new science as well as their compatibility to be used in bispecific antibody formats with our existing antibody programs. Development is focused on emerging, important pathways controlling inflammatory diseases or immunity to tumors.
CDX-585
CDX-585 combines our proprietary highly active PD-1 blockade and anti-ILT4 blockade to prevent immunosuppressive signals in T cells and myeloid cells, respectively. ILT4 is emerging as an important immune checkpoint on myeloid cells and is thought to contribute to resistance to PD-1 blockade. Interactions of PD-1 and ILT4 with their ligands are known to deliver immune suppressive signals that can attenuate anti-tumor immune responses. The concept behind CDX-585 is to simultaneously inhibit both T cell and myeloid suppressive signals to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of both cell types, and potentially overcome PD-1 resistance. In preclinical studies, CDX-585 was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of PD-1 signaling in comparison to the approved PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. In addition, CDX-585 activated and promoted a strong inflammatory phenotype in human macrophage and dendritic cell cultures. Together these activities of CDX-585 enhanced the response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay above that observed for either parental mAb or the combination of the PD-1 and ILT4 mAbs. The in vivo efficacy of CDX-585 was also demonstrated in a melanoma humanized mouse model. CDX-585 has successfully completed GMP manufacturing and IND-enabling studies to support clinical development. CDX-585 will initially be developed for the treatment of solid tumors either as monotherapy or in combination with other oncologic treatments and is expected to enter the clinic in 2023 in patients with advanced malignancies.
CDX-527
CDX-527 used our proprietary highly active anti-PD-L1 and CD27 human antibodies to couple CD27 co-stimulation with blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway to help prime and activate anti-tumor T cell responses through CD27 co-stimulation, while preventing PD-1 inhibitory signals that subvert the immune response. In the summer of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard of care therapy to be followed by tumor-specific expansion cohorts. Enrollment to the dose escalation portion was successfully completed and an expansion cohort in patients with checkpoint naïve ovarian cancer was initiated. In November 2022, we provided an update on the study. With multiple clinical trials actively recruiting in ovarian cancer, enrollment to the expansion cohort did not meet our internal timelines and a review of the results did not meet internal hurdles for proceeding and we closed enrollment to the study and discontinued the program.
Other programs:
CDX-1140
CDX-1140 is a fully human agonist monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response, which is found on dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells and is also expressed on many cancer cells. A Phase 1 study was conducted in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and B cell lymphomas. An MTD of 1.5 mg/kg was established and clinical activity was observed both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Despite evidence of clinical benefit, questions remain to be answered about CDX-1140, and the broader CD40 agonist class, regarding the best clinical settings, regimens, and possible combinations before advancing into additional Celldex-sponsored studies. Given our pipeline priorities and resource requirements, in August of 2022, we announced that we are not progressing further Company-sponsored studies at this time and are exploring these questions in third-party sponsored studies.
Partnerships
We may enter into co-development and commercialization partnerships for any of our programs where appropriate. In the past, we have entered into collaborative partnership agreements with pharmaceutical and other companies and organizations that provided financial and other resources, including capabilities in research, development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing, to support our research and development programs and may enter into more of them in the future.

7



Partnership agreements may terminate without benefit to us if the underlying products are not fully developed. If we fail to meet our obligations under these agreements, they could terminate, and we might need to enter into relationships with other collaborators and to spend additional time, money and other valuable resources in the process. We cannot predict whether our collaborators will continue their development efforts or, if they do, whether their efforts will achieve success. Many of our collaborators face the same kinds of risks and uncertainties in their businesses that we face. A delay or setback to a partner will, at a minimum, delay the commercialization of any affected drug candidates, and may ultimately prevent it. Moreover, any partner could breach its agreement with us or otherwise not use best efforts to promote our products. A partner may choose to pursue alternative technologies or products that compete with our technologies or drug candidates. In either case, if a partner failed to successfully develop one of our drug candidates, we would need to find another partner. Our ability to do so would depend upon our legal right to do so at the time and whether the product remained commercially viable.
Research Collaboration and License Agreements
We have entered into license agreements whereby we have received licenses or options to license technology, specified patents and/or patent applications. These license and collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments equal to specified percentages of product sales, annual license maintenance fees, continuing patent prosecution costs and potential future milestone payments to third parties upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Summarized below are our significant research collaboration and license agreements for our current clinical drug candidates.
Yale University (Yale)
Under a license agreement with Yale, we may be required to make a one-time payment to Yale of $3.0 million with respect to barzolvolimab upon achievement of a specified commercial milestone. In addition, we may be required to pay a low single-digit royalty on annual worldwide net sales of barzolvolimab. Unless earlier terminated by us or Yale, the Yale license agreement is due to expire no later than May 2038 but may expire earlier on a country-by-country basis under specified circumstances.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Many of the products that we are attempting to develop and commercialize will be competing with existing therapies. Other companies are pursuing the development of new therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting and may compete directly with our drug candidates. We face competition from companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies, as well as firms specialized in the development and production of targeted therapies and immune modulators. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.
The competitors of which we are aware that have initiated a Phase 3 study or have obtained marketing approval for a potentially competitive drug to barzolvolimab for treatment of CSU, CIndU, PN and EoE include: Allakos (lirentelimab for EoE), AstraZeneca (Fasenra for CSU), Galderma/Chugai (nemolizumab for PN), Genentech (fenebrutinib for CSU), Leo Pharma (Adbry for AD), Novartis (ligelizumab for CSU, CIndU and food allergy; remibrutinib for CSU), Regeneron/Sanofi (Dupixent for CSU, CIndU, PN and EoE), and Trevi Therapeutics (nalbuphine for PN).
Our competitors may utilize discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop products more rapidly or successfully than us or our collaborators are able to. In addition, some competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of drug candidates, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and commence commercial sales of our drug candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited experience.
In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies and may establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Moreover, technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors, thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We will also compete for the services of third parties that may have already developed or acquired internal 

8



biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies to target the diseases on which we have focused both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.
We also face competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and in the development and acquisition of technologies.
Our competitive position will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the often lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sales. We will require substantial capital resources to complete development of some or all of our drug candidates, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our drug candidates. In order to secure capital resources, we anticipate having to sell additional capital stock, which would dilute existing stockholders. We may also attempt to obtain funds through research grants and agreements with commercial collaborators. However, these types of funding are uncertain because they are at the discretion of the organizations and companies that control the funds. As a result, we may not receive any funds from grants or collaborations. Alternatively, we may borrow funds from commercial lenders, likely at high interest rates, which would increase the risk of any investment in us.
Manufacturing
We are a research and development company and have limited experience in commercial manufacturing. Our ability to conduct late-stage clinical trials, as well as manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates, depends on the ability of Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) to manufacture our drug candidates on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements, as applicable. We also rely on CMOs for labeling and storage for studies inside and outside the US. In order for us to establish our own commercial manufacturing facility, we would require substantial additional funds and would need to make facility modifications, hire and retain significant additional personnel and comply with cGMP regulations applicable to such a facility. The commercial manufacturing facility would also need to be licensed for the production of our drug candidates by the FDA and meet other regulatory standards. We therefore work with CMOs under established manufacturing arrangements that comply with the FDA’s requirements and other regulatory standards, although there is no assurance that the manufacturing will be successful.
We operate our own cGMP manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, to produce drug substance for our current and planned early-stage clinical trials. Our Fall River manufacturing facility has 250L and 1000L bioreactor capacity and is able to manufacture in compliance with FDA and EU regulations, allowing us to distribute drug candidates to clinical sites in the U.S., EU and ROW for early-stage clinical trials. We have manufactured barzolvolimab and CDX-585 drug substance in our Fall River facility for our current and planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. All products are then filled at CMOs. Any manufacturing failures or compliance issues at contract manufacturers could cause delays in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies for these drug candidates.
Our barzolvolimab drug product is currently administered both intravenously and subcutaneously. In 2022, we manufactured barzolvolimab drug substance at our Fall River facility in subcutaneous form then filled at a CMO to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. The subcutaneous formulation will allow for a potential self-administration at home setting versus the need for intravenous dosing in a hospital or clinic setting. The subcutaneous form could improve the patient experience if the product becomes available commercially. In 2022, we initiated a transfer of our current barzolvolimab manufacturing process to a CMO to allow us to produce larger batches in support of late-stage trials and to prepare for potential commercialization. We believe that barzolvolimab can be scaled up to permit manufacturing in commercial quantities. However, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in scaling up the manufacturing processes.
While we believe that there is currently sufficient capacity worldwide for the production of our potential products through CMOs, establishing long-term relationships with contract manufacturers and securing multiple sources for the necessary quantities of clinical and commercial materials required can be a challenge due to increasing industry demand for CMO services. Qualifying the initial source of clinical and ultimately commercial material is a time consuming and expensive process due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical/biotech industry. These costs may be mitigated by the economies of scale realized in commercial manufacture and product sales. The key difficulty in qualifying more than one source for each product is the duplicated time and expense in doing so without the potential to mitigate these costs if the secondary source is never utilized.

9



Use of third-party manufacturers limits our control over and ability to monitor the manufacturing process. As a result, we may not be able to detect a variety of problems that may arise and may face additional costs in the process of interfacing with and monitoring the progress of our contract manufacturers. If third-party manufacturers fail to meet our manufacturing needs in an acceptable manner or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we would face delays and additional costs while we develop internal manufacturing capabilities or find alternate third-party manufacturers. It may not be possible to have multiple third-party manufacturers ready to supply us with needed material at all or without incurring significant costs.
Commercial Organization
We have limited commercial experience in marketing, sales, distribution and product reimbursement. We have the capability to provide current and future market insights to our research and development organization regarding our potential drug candidates. In the future, we may choose to expand our commercial team and build a full-scale commercial organization which we believe could provide us the opportunity to retain marketing rights to our drug candidates and commercialize such products ourselves where we deem appropriate or pursue strategic partnerships to develop, sell, market and distribute our drug candidates where we deem appropriate.
Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights
In general, our intellectual property strategy is to protect our technology by filing patent applications and obtaining patent rights covering our own technology, both in the United States and in foreign countries that we consider important to our business. In addition, we have acquired and will seek to acquire as needed or desired, exclusive rights of others through assignment or license to complement our portfolio of patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and technological expertise and innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Patents
The successful development and marketing of products by us will depend in part on our ability to create and maintain intellectual property, including patent rights. We are the owner or exclusive licensee to proprietary patent positions in the areas of immunotherapy technologies and antibody technologies. Although we continue to pursue patent protection for our products, no assurance can be given that any pending application will issue as a patent, that any issued patent will have a scope that will be of commercial benefit or that we will be able to successfully enforce our patent position against infringers. We routinely review our patent portfolio and adjust our strategies for prosecution and maintenance of individual cases according to a number of factors, including program priorities, stage of development and patent term.
The key patents and patent applications owned by us or licensed to us that we consider important to our current clinical programs include the following (except where stated otherwise, the indicated and estimated patent expiry dates are the estimated normal expirations if all maintenance fees and annuities are paid when due, and do not include any possible additional terms for Patent Term Adjustments (PTAs), Patent Term Extensions (PTEs), other term extensions or Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs), if these may be secured in due course):

● | We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications directed to barzolvolimab and other anti-KIT receptor antibodies. These patents and patent applications include claims directed to particular anti-KIT antibody compositions of matter, including barzolvolimab compositions of matter, and methods of using such antibodies. A composition of matter patent has been issued in the U.S. which would have an estimated patent expiry date in 2034 (this includes additional term due to PTA, but does not include any PTE if this may be secured in due course) and further U.S. patent applications are pending. Patents have also been issued in Europe, Japan, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, India,the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Singapore and certain other countries. Where issued the foregoing would have estimated normal patent expiry dates ranging from 2032 to 2033. Further international patent applications relating to barzolvolimab are also pending.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We own a pending international patent application directed to anti-ILT4 antibody sequences used in CDX-585 as compositions of matter. We also have rights in further pending international patent applications relating to the bispecific antibody CDX-585 and anti-PD-1 antibody sequences used in CDX-585 as compositions of matter. If, when and where issued the foregoing would have estimated normal patent expiry dates ranging from 2041 to 2042.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There can be no assurance that patent applications owned by or licensed to us will result in granted patents or that, if granted, the resultant patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. It is also possible that third parties may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that may be necessary or useful to us. In cases where third parties are first to invent a particular product or technology, it is possible that those parties will obtain patents that will be sufficiently broad to prevent us from using important technology or from further developing or commercializing important drug candidates and immunotherapeutic systems. If licenses from third parties are necessary but cannot be obtained, commercialization of the covered products might be delayed or prevented. Even if these licenses can be obtained, they would probably require us to pay ongoing royalties and other costs, which could be substantial.
Although a patent has a statutory presumption of validity in the United States, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to validity or as to the enforceable scope of the patent claims. The validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the Patent and Trademark Office can be challenged in litigation. As a business that uses a substantial amount of intellectual property, we face a heightened risk of intellectual property litigation. If the outcome of the litigation is adverse to the owner of the patent, third parties may then be able to use the invention covered by the patent without authorization or payment. There can be no assurance that our issued patents or any patents subsequently issued to or licensed by us will not be successfully challenged in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that our patents will not be infringed or that the coverage of our patents will not be successfully avoided by competitors through design innovation.
We are aware that others, including universities and companies, have filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the United States and other countries which claim subject matter potentially useful or necessary to the commercialization of our products. The ultimate scope and validity of existing or future patents which have been or may be granted to third parties, and the availability and cost of acquiring rights in those patents necessary to the manufacture, use or sale of our products presently cannot be determined by us.
Third parties may have or may obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing products using our technology, including:

● | certain patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to particular receptors, antigens and antigenic fragments targeted by our current drug candidates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | certain patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to antibodies targeting certain receptors and other targets including anti-ILT4 antibodies, anti-PD-1 antibodies, anti-SCF antibodies, anti-TSLP antibodies and certain other antibodies and their sequences and uses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the patents referred to in the previous paragraphs, there may be other patent applications and issued patents belonging to competitors that may require us to alter our drug candidates and immunotherapeutic delivery systems, pay licensing fees or cease some of our activities. If our drug candidates conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors, universities or others, the patent owners could bring legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the patented products. If any of these actions is successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such third-party patent would be made available on acceptable terms or at all. We believe that there may be significant litigation in the biotechnology industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become involved in that litigation, we could consume substantial resources.
Licenses
We have entered into significant license agreements relating to technologies that are being developed by us. Typically, institutions have granted us an exclusive worldwide license (with right to sublicense) to make, use and sell products embodying the licensed technology, subject to the reservation by the licensor of a non-exclusive right to use the technologies for non-commercial research purposes. Generally, the term of each license is through the expiration of the last of the patents issued with respect to the technologies covered by the license and/or a specified period from first commercial sale on a territory-by- territory basis. We have generally agreed to use reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and to achieve specified milestones and pay license fees, milestone payments and royalties based on the net sales of the licensed products or to pay a percentage of sublicense income. If we breach our obligations, the licensor has the right to terminate the license, and, in some cases, convert the license to a non-exclusive license. Generally, we control and are responsible for the cost of defending the patent rights of the technologies that we license.

11



Proprietary Rights
We also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets and confidential information, and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our know-how and information, or that we can meaningfully protect our rights in such unpatented technology, trade secrets and information. We require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of employment or in providing services to us and all confidential information developed by, or made known to, the individual during the term of the relationship shall be the exclusive property of us and shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in limited specified circumstances. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such confidential information.
Government Regulation
Our activities and products are significantly regulated by a number of governmental entities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. These entities regulate, among other things, the manufacture, testing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, documentation, advertising and sale of our products. We must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA and comparable authorities in other countries, as applicable, for our drug candidates before we can commercialize such drugs in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Product development within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Many drug candidates that initially appear promising ultimately do not reach the market because they are found to be unsafe or ineffective when tested. Our inability to commercialize a product would impair our ability to earn future revenues.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, as applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

We expect that all of our clinical drug candidates will be subject to review as biological products under BLA standards.
Data obtained at any stage of testing is susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Moreover, during the regulatory process, new or changed drug approval policies may cause unanticipated delays or rejection of our product. We may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals within a reasonable period of time, if at all, or avoid delays or other problems in testing our products. Moreover, even if we received regulatory approval for a product, the approval may require limitations on use, which could restrict the size of the potential market for the product.
Clinical Trials
The FDA provides that human clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt and review of an IND application, unless the FDA requests additional information or changes to the study protocol within that period. An IND must be sponsored and filed for each of our proposed drug candidates. Authorization to conduct clinical trials in no way assures that the FDA will ultimately approve the product. Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases. In a Phase 1 trial, the product is given to a small number of patients to test for safety (adverse effects), determine a recommended Phase 2 dose(s) and evaluate any signals of efficacy. Phase 2 trials are conducted on a limited group of the target patient population; safety, optimal dosage and efficacy are studied. A Phase 3 trial is performed in a large patient population, generally over a wide geographic area to provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of the product. The FDA maintains and exercises oversight authority throughout the clinical trial process.
A product’s safety and effectiveness in one clinical trial is not necessarily indicative of its safety and effectiveness in another clinical trial. Moreover, we may not discover all potential problems with a product even after completing clinical trials on it. Some of our products and technologies have undergone only preclinical testing. As a result, we do not know whether they are safe or effective for humans. Also, regulatory authorities may decide, contrary to our findings, that a product is unsafe or not as effective in actual use as its clinical trial results indicated. This could prevent the product’s widespread use, require its withdrawal from the market or expose us to liability. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Any such action could materially harm us. Clinical trials are critical to the success of our products but are subject to unforeseen and uncontrollable delay, including delay in enrollment of patients. Any delay in clinical trials could delay our commercialization of a product.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after receipt before accepting them for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for non-priority products are reviewed within ten to twelve months after filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs and biologics that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, are reviewed in six to eight months after filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or clarification regarding information already provided in 

13



the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or biological products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our drug candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will resume review and may subsequently issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post- approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as changes in indications, manufacturing changes and labeling, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Special Regulatory Procedures
Fast track designation — The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product, concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. A drug that receives fast track designation is eligible for some or all of the following: (i) more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval; (ii) more frequent written communication from the FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers; (iii) eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met; and (iv) “Rolling Review,” which means that a drug company can submit completed sections of its BLA or NDA for review by the FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the NDA or BLA is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Priority review — Under FDA policies, a drug candidate may be eligible for priority review. The priority review program provides for expedited review or an NDA or BLA, typically within a six to eight month time frame from the time a complete application is accepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible 

14



for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease. A fast track designated drug candidate could be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the BLA or NDA submission.
Accelerated approval — Under the law and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Breakthrough therapy designation — The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate.
Orphan drug designation — Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA, BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA has additional authority to take action against manufacturers not adhering to pediatric study requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.
Post Approval
Any drug or biological products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug or biologic.

15



In addition, drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA was also granted new inspection authorities under FDASIA. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, untitled and warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal prosecution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Biosimilars Law
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to provide for an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that demonstrate biosimilarity to a previously-approved biological product. The BPCIA establishes criteria for determining that a product is biosimilar to an already-licensed biologic, or reference product, and establishes a process by which an abbreviated BLA for a biosimilar product is submitted, reviewed and approved. The BPCIA provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from biosimilars competition. Under the BPCIA, the FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar may not be licensed until 12 years after the reference product’s approval. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant may provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product. The BPCIA applies to our drug candidates and could be applied to allow approval of biosimilars to our products.
21st Century Cures Act
On December 13, 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize health care, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects, including for certain oncology- directed research. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health.

16



The Cures Act also authorizes funding for the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative. The Cancer Moonshot initiative’s strategic goals encourage inter-agency cooperation and fund research and innovation to catalyze new scientific breakthroughs, bring new therapies to patients and strengthen prevention and diagnosis. This initiative aims to stimulate drug development through the creation of a public-private partnership with 20 to 30 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to expedite cancer researchers’ access to investigational agents and approved drugs. This partnership is designed to permit researchers to obtain drugs and other technologies from a preapproved “formulary” list without having to negotiate with each company for individual research projects. We will continue to monitor these developments to assess their potential impacts on our business.
Companion Diagnostic Review and Approval
Our drug candidates may rely on the use of a companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate clearance or approval prior to their commercialization. Based on recent FDA guidance documents and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will likely require one or more of our in vitro companion diagnostics to obtain Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, in conjunction with approval of the related drug candidate. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the receipt and timing of commercial approval for such drug candidates.Currently we rely on third-party collaborators to develop companion diagnostics for our drug candidates.
The PMA process is similar to the NDA and BLA processes and is costly, lengthy and uncertain. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.
Furthermore, even after PMA approval is obtained, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the manufacturer of the companion diagnostic. The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. These requirements include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off label” uses, the medical device reporting regulation, and the reports of corrections and removals regulation. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for PMA of new products; and withdrawing PMAs already granted.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products, several other types of federal and state laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing business practices in the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care providers. Applicable state law may be broader in scope than federal law and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to health care professionals.

17



In addition, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we may interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any therapeutic or diagnostic product outside of the United States, we need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Under the EU regulatory system, we will submit most of our marketing authorization applications under the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology, or are for the treatment of cancer, or officially designated as ‘orphan medicines.’ The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) grants orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including a 10-year market exclusivity period for the approved indication, but not for the same product, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
Other Regulatory Processes
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will change or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the drugs will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as commercial health insurers, such as managed care organizations. The process for determining reimbursement rates is separate from the payor coverage decision. Therefore, despite obtaining coverage, reimbursement rates may be lower than expected, which can result in larger out-of-pocket payments for the patient.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we need to conduct analyses and pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the incremental medical benefit over and above the generally-accepted standard of care and cost-effectiveness of the drug. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary, provide insufficient incremental medical benefit, or may not be deemed cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
The containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Given that the Inflation Reduction Act is now in place, potential implications for the biopharma industry are being assessed. In the meantime, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 

18



and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement and/or restrictions in formulary placement may be such that they would significantly limit projected sales volumes. In addition to third-party payors, we will also need to negotiate formulary placement with hospitals, health systems and certain independent delivery networks. Such negotiations may be more protracted than anticipated and may be compromised because of similar considerations, relating to insufficient incremental medical benefit and/or cost-effectiveness.
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. For example, certain EU member states may approve a specific price and volume for a drug product after which incremental revenues or profits need to be paid back by way of rebates. They may also institutionalize utilization restrictions, curb physicians’ drug budgets, provide conditional reimbursement schemes that require additional evidence to be generated post-marketing authorization, etc. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, including prescription drugs, has been evident in EU markets for some time and is now a major focus of federal and state governments in the U.S. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the pricing and reimbursement of new drugs, despite regulatory efforts to bring drugs to market sooner. Cross- border trade has existed for some time in the EU, allowing pharmacies in one country to import, at a lower price, drug from another country, further exerting pricing pressures across the EU. A proposal to allow importation of less expensive drugs from Canada to the U.S. has been under consideration in U.S. Congress. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs.
The marketability of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors and/or hospital administrators fail to provide adequate coverage, reimbursement or formulary placement. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulations may change in the future. In addition, the States may continue to consider legislation of their own which could further restrict the ability to freely price drugs and/or curb utilization in the U.S. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drugs for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
