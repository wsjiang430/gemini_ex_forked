Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a new class of complement medicines for patients with classical complement-mediated autoimmune, neurodegenerative and ophthalmic disorders. The classical complement pathway is a core component to the body’s immune system that activates a powerful inflammatory cascade. We believe that by stopping the classical complement pathway at its start by targeting C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical complement pathway, our approach may have the potential to provide more complete protection against complement-mediated disorders of the body, brain and eye.
 Using our proprietary platform, we are identifying and characterizing the role of the classical complement pathway in three therapeutic areas—autoimmune, neurodegeneration and ophthalmology. In so doing, we are advancing a broad pipeline of product candidates designed to block the early classical cascade and all downstream pathway components and their tissue-damaging functions. Our goal is to suppress excessive or aberrant classical complement activity that contributes to chronic inflammation and tissue damage to slow or even halt disease progression, while preserving the beneficial immune functions of the lectin and alternative complement pathways involved in the clearance of pathogens and damaged cells. We have demonstrated robust target engagement in the body, brain and eye, and clinical proof of concept in multiple diseases, resulting in four flagship programs that we are actively advancing:
 •Guillain-Barré Syndrome, or GBS: We are advancing our lead candidate, ANX005, an investigational, full-length monoclonal antibody, or mAb, formulated for intravenous administration in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of patients with GBS. GBS is a rare antibody-mediated autoimmune disease with no U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapies, and for which we believe maximum suppression of C1q and the classical cascade early in the disease process may act to rapidly prevent nerve damage and irreversible neurological disability. We demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept in a prior placebo-controlled trial and expect to complete enrollment of approximately 220 patients in our ongoing Phase 3 GBS trial in the second half of 2023, with data anticipated in the first half of 2024. 
 •Huntington’s Disease, or HD: We are evaluating ANX005 for the potential treatment of patients with HD, a slowly progressing, inherited and fatal neurodegenerative disease in which we believe C1q triggers synapse loss and neuroinflammation. We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with manifest HD in 2022, in which ANX005 demonstrated positive efficacy results and was generally well-tolerated. Based on the Phase 2 results and a productive engagement with the FDA in late 2022, we are preparing to advance ANX005 into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial for patients with HD in 2023.
 •Geographic Atrophy, or GA: We are evaluating ANX007, an antigen-binding fragment, or Fab, formulated for intravitreal administration, for the potential treatment of patients with GA, the leading cause of blindness resulting from damaged and dying retinal cells. ANX007 is designed to block C1q locally in the eye to provide more complete protection against excess classical complement activity, a key driver of disease. We completed enrollment of approximately 270 patients in our ongoing Phase 2 GA trial in early 2022. We expect to report data from the 12-month treatment-period of the Phase 2 trial in 


mid-2023, followed by additional data after the conclusion of the six-month off-treatment period by the end of 2023.
 •ANX1502 for Autoimmune Indications: ANX1502 is a novel oral small molecule targeting classical complement, which we believe is first-in-kind. We are conducting an ongoing Phase 1 single-ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple-ascending dose, or MAD, clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, of ANX1502 in healthy volunteers. In the SAD trial, a single dose of 450 mg has achieved target drug levels in plasma in patients, consistent with twice-daily dosing. Additionally, ANX1502 has been generally well-tolerated as of October 23, 2022. The SAD trial is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose. We are preparing to initiate a proof-of-concept trial in patients with cold agglutinin disease, or CAD, in 2023, which is supported by positive data previously generated by ANX005 in CAD patients. We also plan to expand development into additional autoimmune indications with strong scientific rationale, including multifocal motor neuropathy, or MMN, in the first half of 2024.
 In addition to our flagship programs, we are studying multiple programs across our three therapeutic franchise areas, including:
 •Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS: We are evaluating ANX005 in a Phase 2a signal-finding clinical trial in patients with ALS, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by C1q activation driving inflammation and neurodegeneration. Preliminary Phase 2a data as of December 6, 2022 from the first eight patients in the trial showed that treatment with ANX005 resulted in a reduction in neurofilament light, or NfL, a neurodegenerative disease biomarker, and slowed disease progression as measured by reductions in revised ALS functional rating scores during the initial 12-week on-treatment period, followed by an increase in disease progression in the off-treatment period. Enrollment in the Phase 2a trial is ongoing, and we expect to report full data from the Phase 2a clinical trial in 2023.
 •Lupus Nephritis, or LN: We are advancing a Phase 1b signal-finding trial of ANX009, a C1q Fab formulated for subcutaneous delivery, using a precision medicine approach for patients with LN who have high baseline complement activity. LN is an autoimmune disease for which pathogenic autoantibodies against C1q enhance activity and uniquely amplify kidney inflammation and damage. Enrollment in the Phase 1b clinical trial is ongoing with multiple patients dosed, and clinical data are expected in the first half of 2023.
 •ANX105: We are continuing to evaluate ANX105, a next-generation full-length mAb, in a Phase 1 SAD clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Enrollment is ongoing and initial data are expected in 2023.
 Beyond our clinical-stage assets, leveraging the learnings from our initial trials and our expertise in the role of C1q and the classical complement pathway, we are evaluating additional orphan and large market indications that are driven by aberrant or excess classical complement activation.
 Annexon was co-founded by the late Dr. Ben Barres, former member of the National Academy of Sciences, Chair of Neurobiology at Stanford University and a pioneer in complement-mediated neurodegeneration, and Dr. Arnon Rosenthal, a world-renowned scientist and industry executive.

Our team is further supported by an experienced scientific advisory board, board of directors and leading healthcare investors that share our commitment to advancing transformative medicines for patients suffering from debilitating autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.
 We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to all of our product candidates, which allows us to strategically maximize value from our product portfolio over time. Our patent portfolio includes patent protection for our upstream complement platform and each of our product candidates.


Our Pipeline
 Our pipeline is led by four flagship programs focused on complement-mediated diseases of the body, brain and eye for which there is significant unmet medical need and where we have the potential to provide a first-in-class treatment opportunity. Beyond our flagship programs, we are evaluating additional clinical-stage product candidates in a variety of indications and have active research efforts for additional pipeline programs in the future. Our clinical-stage pipeline is summarized below:
 
Our first clinical-stage product candidate is ANX005, an investigational mAb designed to block C1q and activation of the classical complement cascade. For GBS, ANX005 is designed to act early in the disease course to prevent nerve damage and irreversible neurological disability in GBS patients. In the Phase 1b dose-ranging trial in GBS patients, treatment with ANX005 was well-tolerated and resulted in full and prolonged C1q engagement and classical cascade inhibition in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. While our Phase 1b trial was not powered to show statistical significance, we observed a significant reduction in NfL, a well-accepted marker of nerve damage in neurodegenerative disease that has been shown to correlate with disease severity and clinical outcomes. Patients treated with ANX005 also showed positive numerical trends across key GBS outcome measures. GBS is a rare, acute, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease impacting the peripheral nervous system. There are currently no approved therapies for GBS in the United States. Intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIg, and plasma exchange are the current standards of care in the Western world and parts of Asia.
In March 2021, we completed the evaluation of our drug-drug interaction, or DDI, study of ANX005 co-administered with IVIg in 14 patients with GBS. The DDI study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ANX005 and IVIg co-administration in GBS patients, and measured PK and PD of ANX005 when administered in combination with IVIg. IVIg, though not approved by the FDA in the United States for GBS, is currently the standard of care for GBS. Results from the DDI study demonstrated that co-administration of IVIg-ANX005 was well-tolerated and achieved full C1q target engagement, and C1q suppression was maintained within the targeted range. The open-label DDI study was not placebo-controlled or powered for statistical significance on efficacy measures. Several key GBS outcome measures were recorded from baseline, and early improvement was observed in GBS patients, including increased muscle strength, decreased NfL and improved GBS disability score. Results from the DDI study were presented at the Peripheral Nerve Society in 2021.
 A randomized, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ANX005 is ongoing in GBS patients in developing countries and is statistically powered to evaluate the efficacy of ANX005 in improving disability in GBS patients. Following an engagement with the FDA regarding the statistical analysis plan for the ongoing Phase 3 trial, we plan to increase the study population by approximately 40 patients for a total of 220 patients. Expanded enrollment

is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023 with data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial anticipated in the first half of 2024. ANX005 has received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for the treatment of GBS.
 We are also studying ANX005 in patients with HD as well as patients with ALS – two neurodegenerative disorders in which aberrant classical complement activation has been shown to be associated with synapse loss, elevated levels of NfL and disease progression. In June 2022, we announced final data from the Phase 2 trial of ANX005 in patients with HD, which showed that treatment with ANX005 was generally well-tolerated, with full target engagement of C1q in both serum and CSF observed throughout the six-month treatment period and well into the three-month follow-up period. Disease progression stabilized for the entire nine months of the study, as assessed by both Composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, or cUHDRS, and Total Functional Capacity, or TFC, the two primary clinical measurement scales for HD. Additionally, HD patients with higher baseline complement activity, as measured by elevated levels of C4a in CSF, demonstrated a rapid clinical benefit, as assessed by both cUHDRS and TFC, that was sustained over the entire nine months of the study. Improvement in cUHDRS and TFC in HD patients with higher baseline complement was evident six weeks after dosing initiation and was maintained over nine months through the on-treatment and follow-up periods. Plasma and CSF NfL levels remained generally consistent through the nine-month study, and were comparable to NfL levels described in published natural history data for HD patients. Based on these findings and a productive engagement with the FDA, we plan to advance ANX005 into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial for patients with HD in 2023.
 Our Phase 2 trial evaluating ANX005 in patients with ALS is ongoing, and is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, target engagement and impact on disease-related biomarkers and clinical outcomes by ANX005. Preliminary data (n=8) showed that treatment with ANX005 resulted in a reduction in NfL and slowing of disease progression, as measured by reductions in revised ALS functional rating scores, during the initial 12-week on-treatment period, followed by an increase in disease progression in the off-treatment period as of December 6, 2022. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing with full data expected in 2023.
 Our second clinical-stage product candidate is ANX007, an investigational C1q-targeting Fab formulated for intravitreal administration in patients with complement-mediated neurodegenerative ophthalmic disorders. Consistent with the results we observed in preclinical studies, in the Phase 1b trial in glaucoma patients, ANX007 was well-tolerated and showed full target engagement and inhibition of C1q in the eye for at least four weeks. We believe inhibition of C1q may provide neuroprotective benefit by preventing the aberrant loss of functioning synapses in the retina in a variety of ophthalmic disorders, including glaucoma and geographic atrophy, or GA. A Phase 2 trial of ANX007 in patients with GA, the leading cause of blindness resulting from damaged and dying retinal cells, is ongoing. ANX007 is designed to block C1q locally in the eye, to provide more complete protection against excess classical complement activity, a key driver of GA, and the loss of photoreceptor neurons. Enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial was completed in early 2022. We plan to report data from the on-treatment period of the Phase 2 trial in mid-2023, followed by data after the conclusion of the six-month off-treatment period by the end of 2023.
 Our third clinical-stage product candidate is ANX1502, an investigational oral small molecule being developed for the treatment of complement-mediated autoimmune diseases. We are evaluating ANX1502 in an ongoing Phase 1 SAD and MAD trial in healthy volunteers. In the SAD trial, a single dose of 450 mg achieved target drug levels in plasma in patients, consistent with twice-daily dosing. Additionally, ANX1502 has been generally well-tolerated as of October 23, 2022. The SAD trial is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose. We are preparing to initiate a proof-of-concept trial in patients with CAD in 2023, which is supported by positive data generated by ANX005 in CAD patients in a Phase 2 signal-finding trial. We plan to expand development of ANX1502 into additional autoimmune indications with strong scientific rationale, including MMN, in the first half of 2024.
 Our fourth clinical-stage product candidate is ANX009, an investigational C1q Fab formulated for subcutaneous delivery, which was evaluated in a first-in-human, or FIH, clinical trial. In this trial, ANX009 was well-tolerated at all dose levels tested and no drug-related safety signals were observed. The trial showed that ANX009 led to sustained C1q inhibition at multiple doses, supporting the potential for twice-weekly subcutaneous administration with the current formulation. We designed ANX009 with a goal of enabling chronic dosing for patients with antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders where anti-C1q may have a disease-modifying effect and where we can utilize our targeted biomarker-driven approach. ANX009 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b signal-finding trial using a precision

medicine approach for patients with LN who have high baseline complement activity. Enrollment in this trial is ongoing with multiple patients dosed and data are expected in the first half of 2023.
We are also developing our next-generation product candidate, ANX105, an investigational mAb with enhanced dosing and PK properties designed for chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Enrollment in a Phase 1 SAD trial of ANX105 in healthy volunteers is ongoing and initial data are expected in 2023.
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to develop disease-modifying medicines for patients suffering from classical complement-mediated diseases. Key elements of our strategy include:
 •Leveraging our distinct approach of inhibiting C1q and aberrant upstream and downstream classical complement activity to address a broad range of well-characterized classical complement-mediated diseases. By inhibiting C1q and the early classical cascade, we believe our product candidates are uniquely designed to address a wide range of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and complement-mediated neurodegenerative disorders of the brain and the eye. We believe full classical complement inhibition may result in clinical benefits by blocking aberrant upstream and downstream immune cell activation in our targeted indications, as well as potentially provide safety advantages by leaving the lectin and alternative pathways intact to perform their normal immune functions. 
 •Prioritizing resources and execution of late-stage development of four flagship programs. By prioritizing our efforts on our four flagship programs in GBS, HD, GA and our novel oral small molecule, ANX1502, our goal is to create near-term value for patients, physicians and stakeholders.
 •Advancing ANX005 through clinical development in multiple autoimmune and neurodegenerative indications of high unmet need. We are developing ANX005 as a potential treatment for GBS, HD and ALS. ANX005 has been generally well-tolerated and demonstrated full target engagement and rapid and durable improvement in clinical outcomes for patients in two difficult-to-treat indications – GBS and HD – and with encouraging, early signs of activity in ALS. We are currently evaluating ANX005 in a pivotal Phase 3 trial in GBS and plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 trial for patients with HD in 2023. Our Phase 2 trial of ANX005 in patients with ALS is underway and we plan to report full data in 2023. 
 •Evaluating ANX007 as an agent for neuroprotective benefit in ophthalmic indications. We are developing ANX007 in neurodegenerative ophthalmic indications, such as GA. ANX007 reduced retinal damage in animal models of GA and glaucoma. In our Phase 1b trial in glaucoma patients, intravitreal administration of ANX007 resulted in full target engagement of C1q at both low and high doses. Based on this clinical dosing data, our preclinical data in glaucoma and GA, and proximate clinical validation from downstream complement approaches, we believe that ANX007 may provide neuroprotective benefit in patients with these and other complement-mediated ophthalmic disorders. ANX007 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with GA with data anticipated in mid-2023.
 •Demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept with ANX1502, an oral small molecule targeting classical complement. We are currently evaluating ANX1502 in an ongoing Phase 1 SAD and MAD trial in healthy volunteers. As of October 23, 2022, ANX1502 has been generally well-tolerated and achieved target drug levels with a single dose. The SAD trial is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose. We are preparing to initiate a proof-of-concept study in 2023 in patients with CAD. Additionally, we plan to expand development into additional autoimmune indications with strong scientific rationale, including MMN.
 •Expanding our portfolios across three therapeutics franchises informed by data from our flagship programs. We intend to leverage learnings from our flagship programs to inform selection of additional orphan and larger patient populations involving related biological mechanisms. In our autoimmune portfolio, additional indications include antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders such as CAD, lupus nephritis (specifically in lupus nephritis patients with endogenous PACA), and MMN. In our neurodegenerative portfolio, additional potential indications include ALS, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In our ophthalmology franchise, additional indications include glaucoma and other complement-mediated neurodegenerative diseases of the eye. We plan to efficiently prosecute 


opportunities across our three therapeutic franchises utilizing our disciplined, biomarker-driven development strategy.
 •Developing additional product candidates that are designed to inhibit activation of the classical complement cascade. We have secured broad intellectual property protection for our upstream complement platform and intend to leverage our intellectual property and know-how to protect and enhance our leading position in developing novel therapeutics that target the classical complement cascade. We are developing product candidates, such as ANX009, to modulate the classical pathway with the potential to become tailored therapeutics for a large range of indications using different molecular modalities, dosing regimens and tissue localization strategies. In addition, we are developing next-generation product candidates, including ANX105, an investigational monoclonal antibody. 
 •Maximizing the value of our product candidates. We currently hold worldwide development and commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to all of our product candidates. We intend to pursue independent development and commercialization in select indications and markets that we can address with a focused sales and marketing organization. We may opportunistically explore licensing agreements, collaborations or partnerships to develop our product candidates in larger market indications where we could accelerate development utilizing the resources of larger biopharmaceutical companies.
 Overview of the Complement System and C1q Biology
 The Complement System—three main complement pathways
 The complement system is an integral component of the immune system that consists of many circulating and locally-produced molecules. This system evolved to enhance, or complement, other components of the adaptive and innate immune systems. The complement system, also known as the complement cascade, rapidly responds to pathogens, damaged cells and unwanted tissue components to facilitate their removal by the immune system.
 There are three main complement pathways (also called cascades)—the classical, lectin and alternative pathways. Each pathway is initiated by different molecules that respond to distinct triggers. When activated, the initiating molecules set in motion a cascade of enzymatic reactions that greatly amplify, or complement, an inflammatory response. The classical pathway is initiated by C1q, which recognizes antibody complexes, specific pathogens, damaged cells or unwanted cellular components. The lectin pathway is triggered by carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens or cells. The alternative pathway amplifies the action of the other two pathways and also self-activates to eliminate pathogens or cells that are not specifically shielded by the body’s built-in self-protective systems. While these three pathways are initiated by distinct molecules, they converge downstream on common pathway components known as C3 and C5.
 The three main pathways of the complement cascade are activated by independent molecules but converge at C3
 

Aberrant activation of the complement system can result in a range of diseases characterized by an attack on healthy tissue, such as red blood cells, nerve cells or kidney components. A broad range of diseases are known to be associated with pathological activation of the complement cascade, including antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders such as GBS, CAD and lupus nephritis, and complement-mediated neurodegeneration disorders in the eye, such as glaucoma and GA, and complement-mediated neurodegeneration disorders in the brain, such as HD, ALS,

frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. We believe intervening in the activation of the complement cascade offers a potent and selective mechanism for specifically slowing or reversing these disease processes.
 Specific activated components of the complement cascade have important immune functions that contribute to three key outcomes:
 •Immune cell recruitment and inflammation. Specific activated molecules from the cascade serve as soluble signals to make blood vessels leaky and attract immune cells into tissues.
 •Directed immune cell attack. Several complement components, including C1q, bind directly to the pathogen and serve as receptors that direct immune cell attack and pathogen engulfment.
 •Membrane damage. Downstream components of the cascade directly puncture the pathogen or cell surface, causing membrane damage and lysis.
 Aberrant activation of the initiating molecule, C1q, can lead to three main outcomes
 

Inhibiting C1q upstream blocks downstream components and functional activities of the classical complement cascade
 Broad potential for classical complement pathway targeted therapeutics in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases
 The classical complement cascade has a well-established role in augmenting antibody function within the immune system. C1q recognizes antibodies bound to pathogens or cells and activates the classical pathway to trigger their removal and clearance by the immune system. C1q can also directly recognize pathogens, damaged cells or unwanted cellular components leading to similar downstream clearance. A more recent finding made by the laboratory of Dr. Ben Barres, our scientific founder, is that C1q also directly interacts with neuronal connections, or synapses, during early development. Recognition of weaker synapses by C1q triggers the classical complement cascade and directs immune cells to “prune” the synapses away from neurons, thereby reinforcing stronger synapses to establish appropriate neuronal connections.
 Because of its central role in immune function, aberrant activation of C1q can lead to damage of healthy tissue and destruction of functioning synapses. We are focused on two distinct disease processes involving C1q as a key mediator of tissue damage: antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and complement-mediated neurodegeneration.




In antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, self-reactive antibodies bind to cells or tissues, activating C1q and leading to damaging inflammatory responses. We have observed that inhibition of C1q was protective in several animal models of antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, including neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, and two variants of GBS. In NMO, auto-antibodies recognize cells within the central nervous system, or CNS, and can lead to rapid localized destruction of the optic nerve and regions of the spinal cord, while in GBS pathogenic antibodies react with components of the peripheral nerve system, or PNS, to cause widespread peripheral nerve damage and paralysis. This disease process is also evident in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease involving blood components, such as CAD, characterized by auto-reactive antibodies that trigger destruction of red blood cells, and systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, where endogenous pathogenic antibodies against C1q itself drive aberrant C1q activation and are highly associated with kidney damage, or lupus nephritis.
 In complement-mediated neurodegeneration, aberrant activation of C1q at synapses in aging and disease can lead to excessive synapse loss and neuronal damage, driving disease progression in multiple neurodegenerative disorders regardless of the initiating factor. In animal models, C1q accumulated on synapses with age, building up to 300-fold higher levels than in younger animals. It did not activate with normal aging, but other inflammatory stimuli, including misfolded proteins, metabolic dysfunction or increases in intraocular pressure, appeared to aberrantly reactivate C1q’s developmental role in synapse elimination. Complement activation and aberrant synapse pruning in disease may lead to neuroinflammation, loss of synaptic neuronal connections and neurodegeneration. In support of this hypothesis, we and other investigators have observed that C1q inhibition was protective in numerous models of neurodegenerative disease, including diseases of the eye, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, chronic diseases of the CNS, such as frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s, HD and Spinal Muscular Atrophy, or SMA, and acute injury, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke.


Synaptic loss is a pathogenic driver of disability in many neurodegenerative diseases, protected with C1q inhibition
 

Our differentiated approach to treating complement-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease through inhibition of C1q
 We believe that in order to selectively inhibit aberrant activation of the classical complement pathway implicated in driving certain complement-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to target the early components of the classical cascade, particularly C1q, C4 and C3. Activated fragments of C4 and C3 induce vascular leakiness and immune cell recruitment into the tissue, while other fragments of C4 and C3, as well as C1q, work together to direct immune cell attack to the cell or synapse surface. Furthermore, C1q inhibition blocks downstream classical pathway activation of C5 and its membrane damaging effects. We believe that inhibition of C1q does not block the activity of these components in the lectin or alternative complement pathways, and both of these pathways will continue to perform their normal immune functions.
 Our Platform
 Our novel upstream complement platform is designed to completely inhibit classical complement activity for the treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and complement-mediated neurodegenerative diseases in the body, brain and eye. We believe there are potential advantages to our approach of upstream inhibition of the classical complement cascade, which include:
 •Full inhibition of the classical cascade while preserving healthy immune function of the other complement pathways. Inhibition of C1q fully inhibits the classical cascade, including components downstream of C1q such as C4, C3, C5 and the downstream membrane attack complex. As a result, we believe our approach is designed to block all classical complement activity that can contribute to disease pathology, including immune cell recruitment, directed immune cell attack and membrane damage. By targeting upstream tissue-damaging components of the classical complement pathway, our approach leaves the lectin and alternative pathways to perform their normal immune function, which may aide both clinical improvement and safety. Our approach is also distinct from inhibiting C3 or C5. Inhibition of C5 will not affect the upstream components of the classical pathway involved in pathology (C1q, C4 and C3), while inhibition of C3 will block downstream components in all three complement pathways.
 •Broad applicability across many indications. We believe our approach has broad utility for the treatment of diseases in which full inhibition of the entire classical complement cascade may be beneficial. We believe our approach is distinguishable from those that target only downstream complement components. Our initial indications represent our beachhead within antibody-mediated autoimmune and complement-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, and we will selectively pursue both orphan and larger patient population diseases with clear biological evidence of classical complement activation. We are also developing novel product candidates targeting C1q and early components of the classical complement 


cascade, and will utilize different modalities to target these components of the classical complement pathway.
 •Disciplined, biomarker-driven development strategy for our product candidates. We are deploying a disciplined, biomarker-driven development strategy designed to establish confidence that our product candidates are engaging the specific target at a well-tolerated therapeutic dose in the intended patient tissue. We design small, early-stage clinical trials to rigorously evaluate our product candidates using target engagement and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. We are utilizing sensitive, specific assays for C1q and activation of downstream classical complement components to evaluate target engagement in patient tissues that are most relevant for the diseases that we are treating. We believe that this strategy allows us to make rational decisions regarding our therapeutic pipeline, increasing the probability of technical success over shorter development timelines.
 Our Pipeline
 Our pipeline is led by four flagship programs focused on complement-mediated diseases of the body, brain and eye for which there is significant unmet medical need, and where we have the potential to provide a first-in-class treatment opportunity. Beyond our flagship programs, we are evaluating additional clinical-stage product candidates in a variety of potential indications and have active research efforts for additional pipeline programs in the future. Our clinical-stage pipeline is summarized below:
Our Flagship Programs
 Guillain-Barré Syndrome
Overview of Guillain-Barré Syndrome
 GBS is a severe acute inflammatory disease typically triggered by a preceding infection, in which aberrant auto-antibodies that recognize neurons or associated cells cause neuronal injury and acute paralytic neuropathy. In 2011, the estimated annual incidence of GBS was approximately 12,000 in North America and Europe. In 2019, there were 150,095 total cases of GBS worldwide, which was a 66% increase from the 90,249 cases recorded worldwide in 1990. The prevalence of GBS continues to increase with advancing age. In 2004, the annual economic cost of GBS in the United States was $1.7 billion, largely due to the permanent disability and mortality it can cause.


There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of GBS. Treatment guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology recommend early initiation of IVIg or plasma exchange in patients diagnosed with GBS. IVIg and plasma exchange are the established standards of care in the Western world and parts of Asia. Although IVIg and plasma exchange have been shown to provide some benefit, significant unmet need still exists, and many patients, despite receiving the standard of care, are left with residual neurological disability, accompanied by chronic pain and fatigue.
 The clinical course of GBS usually involves rapidly progressive weakness in the limbs culminating in neuromuscular paralysis within two to four weeks of onset. According to 2011 estimates, 20 to 30% of patients require mechanical ventilation, over 20% have permanent motor or sensory disability and 2 to 17% of cases result in death globally. Many patients with GBS require extensive monitoring and supportive care and will seek treatment in a hospital within a few days of onset of the disease. Because approximately a quarter of patients need artificial ventilation due to respiratory muscle weakness, and many develop autonomic disturbances, admission in an intensive care unit is frequently necessary. Symptoms peak within four weeks as the auto-antibody response declines, followed by a recovery period that can last months or years, as the nervous system repairs itself.
 C1q is a key driver of pathogenesis in GBS
 GBS is an acute, autoimmune disease driven by antibodies that lead to activation of the classical complement cascade. Pathological nerve-targeting auto-antibodies, which may be triggered by an infection, lead to the activation of C1q and the classical complement cascade. Studies have shown that pathogenic auto-antibodies are present in the serum and CSF and that activated components of the complement cascade are deposited on peripheral nerve tissue from GBS patients. Peripheral nerve roots are immersed in CSF as they emerge from the spinal cord and are prominent sites of damage in GBS. The figure below illustrates the activation of the classical complement pathway within peripheral nerves in a GBS patient. The left image shows a low magnification view of a peripheral nerve from a GBS patient with numerous individual nerve fibers coated with membrane-damaging complement activation products (C5b-9; dark staining). The middle image shows a high magnification view of an individual nerve fiber with deposition of C3d (dark staining), a complement activation product that directs immune cell attack. The right image shows a highpower image of an individual nerve fiber being probed by an infiltrating immune cell (macrophage).
 


We believe that by blocking the activity of C1q early in the onset of the disease, we can minimize the neuronal damage caused by these pathogenic auto-antibodies, in turn reducing the patients’ symptoms and accelerating their neurological recovery.
 Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration, is highly elevated in GBS
 NfL, an intracellular neuron-specific protein, has emerged as a well-accepted biomarker of nerve damage in disorders characterized by damaged or degenerating nerves. NfL is a subunit of neurofilaments, which are cylindrical proteins exclusively located in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and are released into the CSF and blood when nerves are damaged (illustration below). Recent ultrasensitive techniques, such as single-molecule array technology, have made it possible to accurately and quantitatively detect longitudinal changes of NfL in both blood and CSF, with very low

analytical variation. These assay properties, in addition to neuron-specificity, position NfL as an important decision-enabling tool in proof-of-concept studies of neuroprotective agents across a wide variety of diseases.
 Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) is released from damaged nerve cells
 


Elevated NfL levels correlate with current patient disability and predict patient outcomes in autoimmune neurological diseases such as GBS, multiple sclerosis, or MS, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy as well as in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, effective treatments for MS (e.g., ocrelizumab, natalizumab and fingolimod) and SMA (e.g., nusinersen) that prevent neurological disability in patients have been shown to significantly reduce NfL levels in these same patients. In patients with GBS, NfL is very highly elevated (in some instances, greater than 100-fold above normal). Retrospective and prospective studies in GBS patients have shown that NfL levels in CSF and serum may correlate with disease course, severity and prognosis in GBS.
 Preclinical Development in GBS
 As illustrated below, in a mouse model of severe GBS, ANX005 treatment blocked complement deposition on nerve terminals (left panel) and protected respiratory and motor function (right panel) when compared to an irrelevant immunoglobulin G, or IgG, isotype control antibody. A p-value is a measure of the statistical significance of the observed result. By convention, a p-value lower than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Phase 1a Trial in Healthy Volunteers
 ANX005 was initially evaluated in a Phase 1a dose-escalation single-dose trial designed to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This trial was conducted in 27 healthy volunteers in Australia. The dosing levels of ANX005 delivered in this trial ranged from 1 mg/kg to 8.2 mg/kg. We terminated the trial in healthy volunteers and transitioned our clinical development to evaluate ANX005 directly in patients with GBS based on guidance from the FDA in order to expediently advance this program in the United States.
 Phase 1b Trial in GBS Patients
 We have closely coordinated our clinical efforts with leading researchers of the International GBS Outcome Study, or IGOS, in pursuing a novel therapy for GBS. With the goal of aiding the development of effective treatments for GBS, practitioners established IGOS in May 2012, and have collected natural history data from over 1,750 newly-diagnosed GBS patients worldwide. IGOS is a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that aims to identify the clinical and biological determinants and predictors of disease onset as well as the subtype, course and outcome of GBS. IGOS was established to help develop a better understanding of the mechanism of disease progression and recovery and to conduct selective therapeutic trials to improve patient outcomes. This natural history database is an invaluable resource to clinical development, facilitating the design of clinical trials, optimal selection of endpoints, and patient follow-up for one to three years. We initiated our GBS clinical development in Bangladesh, a country where the incidence of GBS is several times higher than in North America and Europe and where 17% of patients die from the disease and 20% suffer permanent disability and are unable to walk. Additionally, our site in Bangladesh is well situated to conduct clinical research in GBS in a manner compliant with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. As of March 2017, Bangladesh had enrolled more patients in IGOS than any other country, representing approximately 15% of all enrolled patients worldwide.
 We conducted a Phase 1b placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial (n=31) of ANX005 in GBS patients at a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh, in compliance with GCP as described above. The trial objectives included safety and tolerability, dosing levels and target engagement, and included a follow up of eight weeks. The dosing levels of ANX005 delivered in this trial ranged from 3 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg. ANX005 was well tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events or drug-related discontinuations occurred. The most common adverse events were acute infusion-related reactions, or IRRs, which occurred in the majority of patients and presented as low grade, non-serious, transient skin rash. These acute IRRs were mitigated by standard anti-inflammatory pre-medications.
 Results from the Phase 1b trial showed increasing serum levels of ANX005 and its duration in the circulation at increasing dose levels, and that the drug was present in the serum for up to three weeks at a dose of 75 mg/kg (left panel). When ANX005 was present in the circulation C1q function was fully inhibited, and rapidly returned to normal levels as ANX005 serum levels declined (right panel showing data from a patient receiving 75 mg/kg).
 

   Much of the proximal weakness in GBS patients is due to involvement of peripheral nerve roots that are immersed in CSF as they exit the spinal cord. Hence, we believe product candidate levels and target inhibition in CSF may be an important contributor to efficacy. We observed that ANX005 entered the CSF of GBS patients treated with doses of 18-75 mg/kg of ANX005, resulting in full engagement of C1q inhibition in the CSF (as shown below).
 
Inhibition of C1q Observed in CSF at 18-75 mg/kg
 


In the Phase 1b trial in GBS patients, ANX005 treatment at doses that engaged C1q in both serum and CSF (i.e., 18-75 mg/kg dose) resulted in a statistically significant early decline in serum NfL levels compared to placebo (two to four-week post treatment p-value <0.05, left panel below). In this Phase 1b trial, we also explored the administration of ANX005 on multiple validated clinical disability measures including GBS-Disability Score, or GBS-DS, Medical Research Council Muscle Strength Scale, or MRC, and Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale, or I-RODS, over an eight-week period. We observed that early decline in NfL correlated with improvement in the GBS-DS at the end of the study (two to eight-week post treatment p-value <0.05; right panel below). We believe these results suggest that ANX005 had a rapid impact on the disease process by ameliorating antibody-induced nerve damage, likely within the first two weeks of dosing.

 | | * r is a statistical measure for the correlation of two variables that ranges from -1 to 1. The closer r is to 1 or -1, the more closely the variables are related. A correlation of 0.431 is considered moderate correlation.

 Though the trial was not powered for statistical significance, treatment with ANX005 resulted in consistent, positive numerical trends, including an improvement in MRC score and the number of days of ventilation. We observed a dose-dependent trend for improvement in MRC within the first week of treatment (as shown below).
 
Mean Change in MRC Score
Week 1 from Baseline
 

Dose ANX005 (mg/kg)
 
Early improvement in MRC is known to have strong prognostic implications on long-term functional recovery (modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score). In line with this published data, we found that early improvement in MRC correlated with patients’ disability scores at the end of the Phase 1b trial (GBS-DS at week eight). This result is important because GBS-DS is typically used as the primary endpoint in GBS registrational studies. In addition, using a responder analysis, 28% of patients treated with high dose ANX005 (18-75 mg/kg) improved by at least three points on GBS-DS by week eight compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients (as shown below). Patients treated with ANX005 showed a trend of improvement on GBS-DS when using a mean analysis. Both results are promising but not statistically significant.
 


Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial, we selected the 75 mg/kg dose of ANX005 for ongoing development in GBS. Following the completion of the Phase 1b treatment cohorts (through 75 mg/kg), two unblinded exploratory cohorts were enrolled to establish higher dose and multiple dose safety and PK/PD to inform subsequent chronic dosing trials. These two exploratory cohorts were a single dose of 100 mg/kg, and two doses of 75 mg/kg separated by one week (150 mg/kg total). At these higher dose levels, ANX005 was well-tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events or drug-related discontinuations occurred; moreover, we did not reach a maximum tolerated dose. Similarly, we observed full inhibition of C1q in serum and CSF, a reduction in NfL and trends of improvement in clinical measures when compared to placebo; however, there was no additional impact on these clinical measures beyond that seen at 75 mg/kg.
 The results of the Phase 1b dose-ranging trial in GBS showed that ANX005 was well-tolerated, fully inhibited C1q in the blood and CSF at target doses, and demonstrated an early reduction in NfL levels. Drug treatment was associated with a trend for early improvement in MRC, and early changes in MRC significantly correlated with improved clinical measures in GBS patients. An additional key learning from the study is the importance of using baseline MRC for patient stratification at the time of hospitalization and study entry. Accounting for baseline MRC strengthened the impact of ANX005 treatment in the biomarker and clinical measures, demonstrating that MRC will be an important stratification tool in future GBS trials.
 Ongoing Development of ANX005 for GBS
 A randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the safety of ANX005 and efficacy in improving disability in GBS patients is ongoing. Following a productive engagement with the FDA regarding the statistical analysis plan for the ongoing pivotal trial, we plan to increase the study population by approximately 40 patients for a total of 220 patients. Expanded enrollment is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023 with pivotal data anticipated in the first half of 2024.
 Huntington’s Disease
Overview of Huntington’s Disease
 HD is an orphan hereditary neurodegenerative disease that is fatal and for which there are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow its course of progression. HD symptoms typically begin to manifest between the ages of 30 to 50 and progress as a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements, known as chorea, spreading to all muscles, progressive dementia and psychiatric manifestations such as depression and psychosis. Ultimately, affected individuals succumb to cardio-respiratory complications. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 10 to 20 years. Some of the symptoms of HD such as chorea and depression can be managed with medications.
 Approximately 25,000 to 35,000 people in the United States have HD. Estimates project that approximately 75,000 people in the United States and other major market countries will have HD by 2025. Because HD is a genetic

disease in which an individual with a single copy of the dysfunctional gene will develop the disease, every child of a parent with HD has a 50% chance of inheriting the faulty gene and developing the disease. There are an estimated 200,000 individuals in the United States who have a 50% risk of developing HD because of their family relationship to HD patients. It is estimated that only 5-7% of these at-risk individuals have voluntarily undergone genetic testing due to the devastating nature of the disease and the lack of any effective treatments. The development of a disease-modifying therapy could encourage at-risk patients to seek out testing and thereby both provide hope to gene carriers and expand the number of patients who may benefit from treatment.
 C1q is a key driver of pathogenesis in HD
 HD is caused by a genetic mutation, specifically, by expansion of the number of cytosine-adenine-guanine, or CAG, nucleotide sequences within the DNA of the huntingtin gene, which leads to production of a mutant huntingtin protein that is thought to be neurotoxic and promote the degeneration of neurons. Above a threshold of 35 CAG repeats, the age of disease onset is inversely correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The classical complement cascade is activated in HD patients and is associated with progressive synapse loss. We hypothesize that C1q plays an important role in the degenerative process by tagging weakened synapses and triggering a neuroinflammatory response that leads to aberrant synapse loss and progressive neuronal destruction. As shown below, we observed that increased complement activation in HD patients (as measured by the complement activation marker C4a in CSF) was associated with disease progression.
 

Progressive synapse loss in HD patients
 As shown below, researchers observed in post-mortem tissue from HD patients that the number of synapses on neurons connecting specific regions of the brain (the cortex and striatum) were reduced compared to healthy controls, with patients more advanced in the disease process (Huntington’s disease stage 4) showing greater loss of synapses than earlier stage patients (Huntington’s disease stage 2). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that complement activation leads to synapse elimination and neuronal damage.

Development of ANX005 in HD
 In June 2022, we announced final data from the Phase 2 trial of ANX005 in patients with HD. The Phase 2 multi-center, open-label clinical trial evaluated ANX005 administered intravenously for a six-month dosing period in patients with, or at risk for, early manifest HD, followed by a three-month follow-up period. The primary outcome measures of the study were safety and tolerability of ANX005; the pharmacokinetics of ANX005, as measured by serum and CSF concentrations; and pharmacodynamics effects, as measured by C1q, C4a and NfL serum and CSF concentrations. The study enrolled a total of 28 patients, 23 of whom completed both six-months of treatment and the subsequent three-month follow-up period.
Final data showed that treatment with ANX005 was generally well-tolerated, with full target engagement of C1q in both serum and CSF observed throughout the six-month treatment period and well into the three-month follow-up period. Disease progression was stabilized in the overall HD patient population for the entire nine months of the study, as assessed by both Composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS) and Total Functional Capacity (TFC), the two primary clinical measurement scales for HD. Additionally, HD patients with higher baseline complement activity, as measured by elevated levels of C4a in CSF, demonstrated a rapid clinical benefit, as assessed by both cUHDRS and TFC, that was sustained over the entire nine months of the study. Improvement in cUHDRS and TFC in HD patients with higher baseline complement was evident six weeks after dosing initiation and was maintained over nine months through the on-treatment and follow-up periods. Plasma and CSF NfL levels remained generally consistent through the nine-month study and were comparable to NfL levels described in published natural history data for HD patients.



Post-hoc evaluation of two independent markers of neuroinflammation, C3 and YKL-40, showed that treatment with ANX005 led to a decrease in levels of both biomarkers.

Based on the Phase 2 trial results and a productive engagement with the FDA, we plan to advance ANX005 into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial for patients with HD in 2023.
 Geographic Atrophy
 Overview of Geographic Atrophy
 GA is an advanced, vision-threatening form of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and is a chronic, progressive disease of the macula that results in loss of central vision. The disease typically affects one eye first, with a high likelihood of it occurring in the second eye over time.
 There are two forms of AMD, “dry” AMD and “wet” AMD. Dry AMD is the most common form, representing approximately 85% to 90% of all AMD cases. Geographic atrophy represents the advanced form of dry AMD and is characterized by progressive atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial cells, overlying photoreceptors and underlying choriocapillaries. An early feature of the disease is the presence of drusen, which is comprised of extracellular yellow deposits at the back of the retina.
 GA accounts for about 10% of legal blindness related to AMD. Approximately one million individuals in the United States and five million individuals worldwide suffer from geographic atrophy. As with AMD, the prevalence

of geographic atrophy increases with age. There are no approved therapies to prevent either the onset or progression of geographic atrophy.
  Role of C1q and Complement in Geographic Atrophy
 Genome-wide association studies have strongly implicated multiple components of the complement cascade in AMD and geographic atrophy. For example, specific alleles of the gene for C3 can increase the likelihood of developing AMD by 50%. Histopathological investigations have also observed the presence of complement components in geographic atrophy. These studies largely point to a role of excessive C3 activity in disease, but do not indicate how C3 is being activated (classical, lectin or alternative pathways). We have identified a potential dual role of C1q and the classical cascade as an important complement-activating system in geographic atrophy. First, we found that C1q strongly accumulated on photoreceptor cell synapses with normal age or disease, as shown below (left panel), implicating C1q’s role in excessive synapse pruning and complement-mediated neurodegeneration. Second, C1q and C1q ligands, such as C-reactive protein, also accumulated in the retina below photoreceptor cells in association with drusen (extracellular membrane and protein debris associated with geographic atrophy; right panel). These results suggest that the photoreceptor neurons and pigmented retinal epithelial cells – cell types that are both lost in GA – are sandwiched between deposits of C1q and that the classical complement cascade may have an ongoing and pathogenic role in GA by activating C3.
 
In support of this hypothesis, we found that either deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of C1q was protective in an animal model of photoreceptor neuron loss induced by photo-oxidation, as shown below. Further, components of the classical complement cascade have been associated with photoreceptor cells in human GA tissue (C4 and C3) and implicated in photoreceptor cell targeting with an in vitro assay. Finally, C1q is locally produced within the retina during disease by infiltrating immune cells, indicating that its pathogenic role may be amenable to local inhibition of C1q. As described above, we believe inhibition of C1q would block all key components of the classical cascade, including C1q, C4, and C3 involved in immune cell attack and synapse pruning, as well as C5 involved in direct membrane damage.
 As shown below, C1q inhibition was protective of photoreceptor cells and retinal function in a model of photoreceptor cell damage induced by light.



Phase 1b Trial in Glaucoma to Support Development in GA
 We completed single-ascending dose (n=9) and sham-controlled multiple dose (n=17) studies of intravitreal ANX007 in patients with glaucoma to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and target engagement. These patients had aqueous humor taps so that ocular fluid could be analyzed for levels of ANX007 and free C1q immediately prior to first dose (day 1) and prior to second dose (day 29). The studies showed that ANX007 was well-tolerated at all doses (1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg) and achieved complete suppression of C1q at 2.5 mg and 5 mg, as illustrated below. We believe these results suggest that ANX007 can be dosed monthly or potentially less frequently in future Phase 2 efficacy trials. We are exploring further development of ANX007 that could enable patients to be dosed as infrequently as every six months.
 
Development of ANX007 for GA
 Based on our Phase 1b clinical results in glaucoma, our preclinical data showing protection in retinal neurodegeneration animal models, and C1q biology in this setting, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of ANX007 in GA. Our rationale to pursue ANX007 for GA includes:
 •The classical complement pathway is implicated in GA by human genetics, and C1q and C4 are associated with pathology in human GA tissue. C1q is produced locally in the eye by infiltrating immune cells and may be more amenable to local inhibition by intravitreal administration of ANX007.
 •The potential role of C1q in GA may be dual-purpose, resulting in both complement-mediated neurodegeneration and localized tissue damage unique to the eye. Local administration of ANX007 has 


been shown to be protective in animal photoreceptor neuron loss and achieved complete C1q inhibition in patients for 1-2 months.
 •There is a well-established clinical and regulatory path for development.
 Ongoing Phase 2 Trial in Geographic Atrophy
 A randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial in GA patients who are at a high risk of progression is ongoing. The Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate clinical effect of ANX007 on slowing of GA lesion growth over a one-year treatment period, leveraging the natural history data and patient selection criteria of prior GA trials. Enrollment in the Phase 2 trial was completed in early 2022, and initial data from the treatment-period portion of the trial are anticipated in the first half of 2023, with full data after the conclusion of the six-month off-treatment period anticipated by the end of 2023.
 ANX1502
Overview of ANX1502
 ANX1502 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of classical complement designed for oral administration in a range of chronic autoimmune diseases. ANX1502 converts to the active compound, ANX1439, on administration and delivers a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the activated form of C1s—part of the C1 complex that initiates the classical pathway. The active compound has been shown to have a high affinity to C1s and demonstrate a robust functional inhibition of the classical pathway.
 

Role of C1s in Complement-Mediated Autoimmune Diseases
 The C1 complex is responsible for the activation of the classical pathway and is comprised of C1r, C1s and C1q. As part of the disease process, once activated, C1s is responsible for cleaving C4 and C2, key amplification components of the classical cascade. We believe that by stopping C1s from cleaving C4 and C2 with ANX1502, we will be able to block the classical cascade to reduce levels of inflammation, slow disease progression and potentially impact disease outcomes for patients.



Ongoing Phase 1 SAD Trial of ANX1502
 We are evaluating ANX1502 in an ongoing Phase 1 SAD trial in healthy volunteers. In the SAD trial, a single dose of 450 mg has achieved target drug levels in plasma in patients, consistent with twice-daily dosing as of October 23, 2022. Additionally, ANX1502 has been generally well-tolerated.
 
The SAD trial is ongoing to identify the maximum tolerated dose, and in parallel we are conducting a MAD trial of ANX1502 in healthy volunteers. We believe these efforts to characterize dosing properties of ANX1502 will lead to a proof-of-concept study in patients with CAD in the second half of 2023, which is supported by positive data generated by ANX005 in CAD patients in a Phase 2 signal-finding trial. We also plan to expand development into additional autoimmune indications with strong scientific rationale, including MMN, in the first half of 2024.
 Development of ANX1502 for Autoimmune Disease
 ANX1502 for Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD)
 Autoimmune hemolytic anemias, or AIHA, are characterized by the presence of auto-antibodies that bind red blood cells and activate the classical complement pathway. The temperature at which these auto-antibodies bind to red blood cells determines whether the hemolytic anemia is labeled “cold” or “warm.” In both cases, the antibodies trigger classical complement activation, which tags red blood cells with complement components (e.g., C3d and C4d) for removal in the spleen or liver (via extra-vascular hemolysis) or, less commonly, leads to their direct lysis within blood vessels by the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (intravascular hemolysis). There are no approved treatments for AIHA in the United States; however, blood transfusions, steroids, rituximab, chemotherapies and splenectomies are currently used to treat patients with AIHA. It is estimated that up to 30% of patients require second-line treatment when treated with the standard of care treatment and approximately 11% of cases after symptom onset result in death.


CAD is a form of AIHA that affects approximately 5,000 people in the United States. We evaluated ANX005 in a Phase 2 study in patients with CAD and showed (n=3) that ANX005 was generally well tolerated for up to one year, the longest treatment duration of ANX005 to date. Additionally, ANX005 achieved full target engagement, completely inhibiting C1q and downstream complement components – consistent with ANX005 in other indications, and positive outcomes were observed in all CAD patients.
 

Based on these data, we plan to initiate a proof-of-concept study with ANX1502 in patients with CAD in 2023.
 ANX1502 for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)
 MMN is a slowly progressing motor neuropathy disease characterized by progressive asymmetric distal weakness and muscle wasting over time. There are approximately 12,000 people affected by MMN in the United States and EU, and the disease primarily affects middle-aged men. The disease is driven by complement-activating autoantibodies against GM1, a ganglioside enriched in peripheral nerves, and is most often characterized by a motor nerve conduction block. Patients are often treated with IVIg; however, progressive nerve damage continues, and patients will require life-long and time-consuming treatment.
 
There is a strong rationale for C1 inhibition as a therapy for MMN. As part of the disease process, when anti-GM-1 ganglioside antibodies bind to peripheral nerves, C1q, C4b and C3b deposit on the nerve surface and contribute to progressive nerve damage. Complement deposition can be measured in an ex vivo assay using patient serum exposed to purified GM-1 on an assay plate (Figure below, left panel), and the degree of complement deposition activity

correlates with the patients’ disease severity (middle panel). Blocking C1q activity protects against damage on cultured neurons in the presence of MMN autoantibodies (right panel).

Based on this scientific rationale, we plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind trial assessing theefficacy of ANX1502 compared to IVIg in the first half of 2024. The trial will be designed to assess the safety and tolerability of ANX1502 in the MMN patient population. We will plan to assess measures of peripheral muscle strength using Medical Research Council sum score to evaluate global muscle strength, as well as hand-held dynamometry and patient function.
Our Additional Programs
 ANX005 for ALS
 Overview of ALS
 ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no disease modifying treatment that affects about 30,000 patients worldwide. There are rare familial forms of ALS (e.g., due to DNA mutations in the SOD1 and C9ORF72 genes), but the majority of ALS cases are considered sporadic. The disease is a motor neuron disease impacting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. ALS causes progressive weakness of muscles involved in limb movement, respiratory activity, swallowing and speaking. Death typically occurs within two to five years after symptom onset. There is evidence that neurodegeneration involves both central and peripheral synapses. The NMJ is a specialized

synapse between peripheral motor nerve and muscle fiber. As illustrated below, “dying back” of the peripheral nerve in ALS is associated with C1q / classical complement deposition on the NMJ.
 


C1q involvement in ALS
 C1q and classical pathway activation is elevated in ALS patients. Specifically, C1q deposition has been noted in NMJs and C4d levels are increased in the CSF of ALS patients.
 As shown below in a third-party preclinical model of ALS, muscle levels of C1q (at NMJs) increased with age (left panel) and were observed to correlate with decline in muscle strength (right panel).
 


Our goal with our C1q inhibitor is to prevent both the central and peripheral loss of synapses. Of note, there is significant overlap in the peripheral nerve structures that are involved in both GBS and ALS; therefore, we believe our ANX005 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data in GBS patients can be extrapolated to ALS patients.
 Likewise, in an experimental model of SMA, another disease with both central and peripheral aspects of nerve damage, we found that treatment with anti-C1q antibody (mouse precursor of ANX005) protected against synapse loss and improved motor function. The same peripheral nerve pathway is involved in GBS and ALS, as illustrated below.


The same peripheral nerve pathway is involved in GBS and ALS
 

NfL is elevated in ALS patients
 ALS patients have substantial elevations of NfL in both CSF and serum compared with controls and pre-symptomatic mutation carriers. In ALS patients, serum levels of NfL have been observed to increase in the year prior to onset of disease symptoms (see below). In addition, it has been observed that NfL levels in ALS patients correlated both with current disability and future patient outcomes.
 Serum NfL Elevated in ALS Patients a Year Prior to Symptom Onset
 


ANX005 Preliminary Phase 2a Data
 We are currently conducting an open-label Phase 2 trial in ALS patients to evaluate the ability to inhibit C1q in the CSF and to reduce NfL levels in serum with ANX005. Preliminary data as of a cutoff date of December 6, 2022, from our ongoing Phase 2a trial (n=8) showed that treatment with ANX005 resulted in a reduction in NfL (left panel) and slowing of disease progression (right panel), as measured by reductions in revised ALS functional rating scores, during the initial 12-week on-treatment period, followed by an increase in disease progression while off treatment.



Enrollment in our Phase 2a trial is ongoing with full data expected in 2023.
 Lupus Nephritis
 Overview of LN and Role of C1q
 LN is one of the most serious complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the kidneys, leading to inflammation and possibly to organ damage. Inflammation of the kidneys can harm the ability of the overall renal system to properly remove waste from blood, maintain the correct amount of body fluids, and regulate hormone levels for controlling blood pressure and blood volume. LN affects approximately 60,000 people in the United States each year.
 In active disease, pathogenetic auto-antibodies against C1q (PACAs) enhance LN disease activity by enhancing C1q activity and amplifying kidney inflammation and damage.
 ANX009 for LN
 ANX009 is designed to potently bind to C1q in the circulation and selectively inhibit activation of the classical complement cascade in the blood stream. ANX009 is a Fab formulated for subcutaneous delivery with a goal of enabling chronic dosing for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases of blood and vascular structures. We believe that the inhibitory activity of ANX009 and its on/off design may benefit patients with hematological autoimmune disorders, including the glomerular inflammation associated with LN.
 We are evaluating ANX009 as a treatment option for a subset of lupus nephritis patients who are at a high risk of renal flare due to pathogenic anti-C1q antibodies in the circulation, and who we believe may respond to treatment with our anti-C1q approach. Importantly, we are taking a precision medicine approach for patients with LN who have high baseline complement activity, and we have identified a potential plasma biomarker that identifies lupus nephritis patients with ongoing early classical complement cascade activation.




We have observed that daily subcutaneous administration of ANX009 fully inhibited C1q functional activity in the serum of non-human primates. Its activity occurred rapidly after the first dose and this activity rapidly reversed after dosing was stopped.
 
A Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial was completed in 2021 and data showed that ANX009 was well-tolerated, consistent with preclinical toxicology studies, and demonstrated complete and sustained inhibition of circulating C1q, supporting potential twice-weekly subcutaneous administration.
 

Ongoing Development of ANX009 for LN
 We are evaluating ANX009 in an ongoing Phase 1b signal-finding trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of ANX009 in patients with LN, as well as explore impact on complement pharmacodynamic markers,

exploratory markers of renal tissue damage and clinical function. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing with data anticipated in the first half of 2023.
ANX105
 We are developing our next-generation product candidate, ANX105, an investigational full-length mAb formulated for intravenous administration. We designed ANX105 to have enhanced dosing and PK properties to enable its use as a chronic treatment for autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. We are evaluating ANX105 in an ongoing Phase 1 SAD trial in healthy volunteers and expect to report initial clinical data in 2023.

Our proprietary technology has been primarily developed by in-house research and development programs, and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, relationships with academic research centers and contract research organizations.
 For our product candidates, we will, in general, initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including by protecting inventions related to additional methods of use, processes of making, formulation and dosing regimens.
 We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to all of our product candidates, which allows us to strategically maximize value from our product portfolio over time. Our patent portfolio includes patent protection for our upstream complement platform and each of our product candidates.
As of January 15, 2023, our patent portfolio, including patents licensed from our partners, comprised 18 different patent families filed in various jurisdictions worldwide. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions.
 One patent family, which we exclusively license from Stanford University, includes nine granted U.S. patents covering various methods of treating neurodegeneration and related medical conditions by inhibiting the C1 complex or its components, such as by using an anti-C1q antibody. The U.S. patents in this family include claims covering uses of ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. These U.S. patents will expire between 2026 and 2030, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term. There are no pending applications or foreign patents in this family.
 Two other patent families, which we own, are directed to anti-C1q antibodies and methods of using them. These families include five granted U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, 19 granted foreign patents and 20 pending foreign patent applications. The U.S. patents in these families cover ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. These patents will expire between 2034 and 2037, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term.

Other patent families that we own include:
 •one granted U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, three granted foreign patents, and 13 pending foreign patent applications. The granted U.S. patent in this family includes claims directed to antibody fragments of anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX007 and ANX009. This patent will expire in 2037, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term;
 •one U.S. patent application and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application. The pending U.S. patent application in this family includes claims directed to anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX105. Patents that may be issued from this family would expire in 2042, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term;
 •one pending U.S. patent application. The pending U.S. patent application in this family includes claims covering a pharmaceutical formulation comprising anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. Patents that may be issued from this family would expire in 2043, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term;
 •one pending U.S. patent application, one pending PCT application, and six pending foreign patent applications. The pending U.S. patent application in this family includes claims covering certain small molecule modulators of the classical pathway, including ANX1502. Patents that may be issued from this family would expire in 2041, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term; and
 •one pending PCT application. The pending PCT patent application in this family includes claims covering certain small molecule modulators of the classical pathway. Patents that may be issued from this family would expire in 2043, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term. 
 Our patent portfolio also includes ten patent families, owned by us solely or jointly with the University of California or The J. David Gladstone Institutes or Fondazione Telthon and Universitia degla Studi di Trento, directed to the treatment of certain medical conditions using anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. These families include six pending U.S. patent applications, one granted foreign patent, 23 pending foreign patent applications, and four pending PCT applications. Patents that may be issued from these applications would expire between 2034 and 2043, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term.
 Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University
 In November 2011, we and The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, entered into an exclusive licensing agreement, or the Stanford Agreement. Under the Stanford Agreement, Stanford granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights, or the Licensed Patents, to make, use, offer for sale, sell, import and otherwise commercialize products covered by the Licensed Patents for human or animal diseases, disorders or conditions. We are required to meet certain development and funding diligence milestones for the licensed products.
 Under the Stanford Agreement, we are obligated to pay Stanford an upfront payment, license maintenance fees ranging from the single digit to tens of thousands of dollars per year, and milestone payments totaling up to $675,000. We also agreed to make royalty payments at a rate equal to a low single-digit percentage of worldwide net sales of licensed products and a portion of certain sublicensing income we receive from sublicensees at a rate in the low double digit percentages, subject to a specified maximum total payment.
Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the Stanford Agreement, upon closing our first financing event that raised at least $2.0 million, we granted Stanford $150,000 in shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock. We may also have to pay a fee to Stanford if we assign our rights under the Stanford Agreement to a third party.
 We may terminate the Stanford Agreement in its entirety, or as to a particular Licensed Patent or licensed product, for convenience on thirty days’ prior written notice. Stanford may terminate the Stanford Agreement for our breach that remains uncured for forty-five days or if we provide any false report, are delinquent on any report or payment, fail to achieve a milestone or fail to diligently develop and commercialize a licensed product.


Patent Term and Term Extensions
 The terms of individual patents are determined based primarily on the filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application to which a claim of priority is made or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application to which a claim of priority is made. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a U.S. patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval for the product covered by that patent. In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may receive the extension, and the extension applies only to coverage for the approved drug, methods for using it and methods of manufacturing it, even if the claims cover other products or product candidates. Where one patent covers multiple products or product candidates, it may only receive an extension for one of the covered products; any extension related to a second product or product candidate must be applied to a different patent. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application to which a claim of priority is made, such as a PCT application. All taxes, annuities or maintenance fees for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time.
 The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product by product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions and the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Our patents and patent applications may be subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Trademarks and Know-How
 In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees and through relationships with third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors, commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Sales and Marketing
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to our product candidates. Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. Should any of our product candidates be approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a plan to commercialize them in the United States and other key markets, through internal infrastructure and/or external partnerships in a manner that will enable us to realize the full commercial value of our programs.
Manufacturing
 Our success as a company will depend on our ability to deliver reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply. We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience. Our staff has strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements and that governs record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, and more. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and compliance is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.
 Our current supply chains for our lead drug candidates involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, specifically, raw materials manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing and drug product manufacturing. We currently operate under work order programs for our drug candidates with master services agreements in place that include specific supply timelines, volume and quality specifications. We intend to establish long-term supply agreements in the future. We believe our current manufacturers have the scale, the system, and the experience to supply our currently planned clinical trials.
 We do not currently require commercial manufacturing capabilities. Should our needs change, we will need to scale up our manufacturing processes to enable commercial launch. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative larger scale suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our executive and scientific team, research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 Guillain-Barré Syndrome
 There are currently no approved therapies for GBS in the United States. IVIg and plasma exchange are the current standards of care in the Western world and parts of Asia. Currently, two investigational products are in development. Hansa Biopharma AB is conducting an open label Phase 2 trial of imlifidase in GBS patients in Europe and the United Kingdom. AstraZeneca/Alexion completed a Phase 3 trial of SOLIRIS (eculizumab) in Japan that did not meet its primary endpoint.
Cold Agglutinin Disease, a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia
 Sanofi’s sutimlimab was approved by the FDA for CAD in February 2022. There are currently three investigational agents in clinical trials for CAD. Novartis’s iptacopan, an oral Factor B inhibitor, is currently in Phase

2. Apellis’s pegcetacoplan is in Phase 3, being conducted by Apellis’s European partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (Sobi). Sanofi is testing BIVV020 in a Phase 1 trial.
Lupus Nephritis
 There are currently two approved medicines specifically for LN: GSK’s Benlysta and Aurinia’s Lupkynis. There are four agents in development targeting the complement pathway, all in Phase 2 development: AstraZeneca’s ravulizumab, a C5 inhibitor, and also ALXN2050, an oral Factor D inhibitor. Omeros is developing narsoplimab, a MASP-2-targeting monoclonal antibody, and Novartis is developing iptacopan, an oral factor B inhibitor. Outside of the complement pathway, there are currently five agents in Phase 3 development for adults with lupus: Roche’s obinutuzumab, Novartis’s secukinumab and ianalumab, AstraZeneca’s anifrolumab and Vera Therapeutics’s ataticept. Additionally, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is planning to start a trial of voclosporin in adolescents with lupus nephritis.
Huntington’s Disease
 There are no approved disease-modifying therapies for HD. Multiple companies are developing potentially disease-modifying therapies, including Prilenia’s Pridopidine in Phase 3, PTC Therapeutics’s PTC518 in Phase 2, Sage Therapeutics’s SAGE-718 in Phase 2, and uniQure’s gene therapy candidate, AMT-130 in Phase 1/2. Roche recently initiated a Phase 2 study of tominersen in prodromal or early manifest HD patients aged 25-50. Additional early-stage products in development are AskBio’s BV-101 candidate gene therapy in Phase1/2, and Wave Life Sciences’s WVE-003 in Phase 1/2.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 The drugs riluzole and Radicava (edaravone) are currently approved for the treatment of ALS and have shown modest effects in slowing the progression of the disease. Amylyx’s Albrioza (AMX0035) was approved by the FDA in September 2022 and has shown a survival benefit among patients with ALS. Zilucoplan, a C5a inhibitor from UCB, is in a Phase 2/3 study as a part of the HEALEY ALS platform trial. Apellis has also initiated a Phase 2 study with APL-2, their C3-inhibitor. Another nine investigational agents are currently in Phase 3 development. There are a significant number of companies conducting clinical trials in ALS patients, including Ionis, NurOwn, Biohaven, Prilenia, Cytokinetics and others.
Geographic Atrophy
 One FDA-approved treatment is currently available for GA, Apellis’s Syfovre, a C3 inhibitor, which was also filed in the European Union in December 2022. Iveric Bio’s avacincaptad pegol, a C5 inhibitor, was filed by the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of October 2023. Other complement cascade-targeted agents in development are Ionis’s IONIS-FB-LR, an antisense molecule inhibitor of Complement Factor B in a Phase 2 trial; AstraZeneca’s danicopan, an oral, complement factor D inhibitor in a Phase 2 trial. A Phase I trial of JNJ 1887, Janssen’s investigational gene therapy expressing soluble CD59, has recently been completed with positive results. Complement-directed therapies in clinical development for genetically selected patient populations include GT005, a Factor I gene therapy in Phase 2 development by Gyroscope (recently acquired by Novartis). Other products that do not target the complement cascade currently in Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials are being developed by Roche, Alkeus, Allegro, and Regenerative Patch Technologies. ONL Therapeutics and Astellas each have an asset in Phase 1 of development.
Multifocal Motor Neuropathy
 Currently, Gammagard Liquid (10% Immune Globulin Infusion (Human)) is the only therapy approved by the FDA for MMN. There are few agents in development for MMN. Argenx’s ARGX-117, an IV-delivered C2 inhibitor is in Phase 2. Takeda is conducting a Japan-based Phase 3 trial of TAK-771, a 10% Immune Globulin and Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) delivered as a subcutaneous infusion.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of product candidates such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the ND, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements, or GLP requirements and other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee, or EC, at each clinical site before the trial is commenced at such site;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended purpose;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all required clinical trials;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA whether to file the application for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for specific indication(s) for use in the United States.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for the proposed clinical trial(s). The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically goes into effect 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period,

raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB or EC for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the trial until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Regulatory authorities, the IRB/ethics committee or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objective(s). There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 trials may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMPs. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be

selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Review and Approval Process
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. The BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product candidate or from a number of alternative sources, including studies and trials initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA or NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA or NDA is also subject to an annual program fee. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as Orphan Drugs, unless the application also seeks a non-orphan-designated indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the Sponsor may meet with the FDA to confirm the additional information required to resubmit the BLA or NDA. Once a BLA or NDA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the filing date. Priority review designation will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for products that, if approved, would represent significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP‑compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facilities in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene a public Advisory Committee to provide additional expert insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an Advisory Committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions regarding approval.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor’s offices to assure compliance with GCP.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of clinical trial sites and manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the BLA or NDA is not ready for approval in its present form and ends the current review cycle, and will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA or NDA. The FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA or NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA or NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Additionally, the FDA may approve

a BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post- marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-marketing studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, drugs and biologics s are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA or NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. A BLA or NDA for a Fast Track-designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA or NDA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the product candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior reviewers at FDA.
 In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drugs and biologics intended to treat serious or life threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the drug or biologic has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires sponsors of products receiving accelerated approval to conduct well-controlled confirmatory required to verify or characterize the drug or biologic’s predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct any required confirmatory studies in a timely manner, or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.


Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval requirements or process.
 If a product candidate that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA or NDA, to market the same biologic or chemical entity for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan Drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the Orphan Drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the Orphan Drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research and development activities and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application user fee.
 A designated Orphan Drug may not receive Orphan Drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received Orphan designation. In addition, Orphan Drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with Orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drugs or biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


•fines, Warning Letters, or untitled enforcement letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of so-called “off-label” uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, Warning Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.


Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including false claims, civil monetary penalties, consumer protection and transparency laws regarding drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the United States. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting obligations, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, including clinical trial data, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data

Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. No uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among U.S. third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that a product will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payor’s reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell a product profitably.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,

along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, absent additional Congressional action. In addition, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, beginning January 1, 2024.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare product candidates and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates once approved or additional pricing pressures.
