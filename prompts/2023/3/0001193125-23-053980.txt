Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

SLR Investment Corp. (the “Company”, “SLRC”, “we” or “our”), a Maryland corporation formed in November 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 
In February 2010, we completed our initial public offering and a concurrent private offering of shares to our senior management team. 
We invest primarily in privately held U.S. middle-market companies, where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are most attractive. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in leveraged middle-market companies in the form of senior secured loans, financing leases and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities. We define “middle market” to refer to companies with annual revenues typically between $50 million and $1 billion. From time to time, we may also invest directly in the debt and equity of public companies that are thinly traded and such investments will not be limited to any minimum or maximum market capitalization. In addition, we may invest in foreign markets, including emerging markets. Our business is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. Our investments generally range between $5 million and $100 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or with strategic initiatives. 
In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns. These investments may include, but are not limited to, direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States. The securities that we invest in are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as “leveraged loans,” “high yield” or “junk” securities, and may be considered “high risk” compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade. In addition, some of our debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which means that a borrower may be unable to payoff its debt due to bankruptcy or other reasons and therefore we may write-off such debt investment prior to its scheduled maturity. Upon such an occurrence, we may realize a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. 
Our investment activities are managed by SLR Capital Partners, LLC (“SLR Capital Partners” or the “Investment Adviser”) and supervised by our board of directors (the “Board” or “board of directors”), a majority of whom are non-interested, as such term is defined in section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. SLR Capital Management, LLC (“SLR Capital Management”) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio totaled $2.1 billion and our net asset value was $999.7 million. Our portfolio was comprised of debt and equity investments in 139 portfolio companies. 
SUNS Merger 
On April 1, 2022, we completed our previously announced acquisition of SLR Senior Investment Corp., a Maryland corporation (“SUNS”). Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among us, SUNS, Solstice Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Investment Adviser, dated as of December 1, 2021, Merger Sub was first merged with and into SUNS, with SUNS as the surviving corporation, and, immediately following the Merger, SUNS was then merged with and into us, with us as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of SUNS’s common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.7796 shares of our common stock (with SUNS’s stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock). As a result of the Mergers, we issued an aggregate of 12,511,825 shares of our common stock to former SUNS stockholders. 
The Mergers are accounted for as an asset acquisition of SLR Senior Investment Corp. by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50, Business Combinations – Related Issues, with the fair value of total consideration paid in conjunction with the Mergers allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of the Mergers. Generally, under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. The cost of the group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than certain “non-qualifying” assets (for example cash) and does not give rise to goodwill. The Company is the accounting survivor of the Mergers. The Mergers were considered a tax-free reorganization and the historical cost basis of the acquired SUNS investments are carried forward for tax purposes. 

1 


Letter Agreement 
On April 1, 2022, in connection with the consummation of the Mergers, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which the Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to a permanent 25 basis point reduction of the annual base management fee rate payable by us to the Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement between us and the Investment Adviser (the “Advisory Agreement”), resulting in an annual base management fee rate payable by us to the Investment Adviser of 1.50% on gross assets up to 200% of our total net assets. We retained the annual base management fee rate payable by us to the Investment Adviser of 1.00% on gross assets that exceed 200% of our total net assets. 
SLR Capital Partners 
SLR Capital Partners, our investment adviser, is controlled and led by Michael S. Gross, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Bruce Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. They are supported by a team of investment professionals. SLR Capital Partners’ investment team has extensive experience in leveraged lending and private equity, as well as significant contacts with financial sponsors. 
In addition, SLR Capital Partners currently serves as investment adviser to private funds and managed accounts as well as to SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC that primarily invests in first lien loans to upper middle market private leveraged companies, SLR HC BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC that primarily invests in first lien healthcare cash flow loans and life science loans, and SLR Private Credit BDC II LLC, an unlisted BDC focused on first lien senior secured floating rate loans. As of February 24, 2023, Mr. Gross and Mr. Spohler beneficially owned, either directly or indirectly, approximately 7.5% of our outstanding common stock. 
Mr. Gross has over 25 years of experience in the private equity, distressed debt and mezzanine (i.e., actually or structurally subordinated) lending businesses and has been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, consummating and managing private equity, distressed debt and mezzanine lending transactions. Prior to his current role as our Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Gross founded Apollo Investment Corporation, a publicly traded BDC. He served as its chairman from February 2004 to July 2006 and its chief executive officer from February 2004 to February 2006. Under his management, Apollo Investment Corporation raised approximately $930 million in gross proceeds in an initial public offering in April 2004, built a dedicated investment team and infrastructure and invested approximately $2.3 billion in over 65 companies in conjunction with 50 different private equity sponsors. Mr. Gross is also a founder and a former senior partner of Apollo Global Management, a leading private equity firm. During his tenure at Apollo Global Management, Mr. Gross was a member of the investment committee that was responsible for overseeing more than $13 billion of investments in over 150 companies. 
Mr. Gross also has served on the boards of directors of more than 20 public and private companies. As a result, Mr. Gross has developed an extensive network of private equity sponsor relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants that we believe should provide us with significant business opportunities. 
We also rely on the over 25 years of experience of Mr. Spohler, who has served as our Chief Operating Officer and a partner of SLR Capital Partners since its inception and as Co-Chief Executive Officer since June 2019. Previously, Mr. Spohler was a managing director and a former co-head of U.S. Leveraged Finance for CIBC World Markets. He held numerous senior roles at CIBC World Markets, including serving on the U.S. Management Committee, Global Executive Committee and the Deals Committee, which approves all of CIBC World Markets’ U.S. corporate finance debt capital decisions. During Mr. Spohler’s tenure, he was responsible for senior loan, high yield and mezzanine origination and execution, as well as CIBC World Markets’ below investment grade loan portfolio in the United States. As a co-head of U.S. Leveraged Finance, Mr. Spohler oversaw over 300 capital raising and merger and acquisition transactions, comprising over $40 billion in market capitalization. 
SLR Capital Partners’ senior investment professionals have been active participants in the primary and secondary leveraged credit markets throughout their careers. They have effectively managed portfolios of senior secured, distressed and mezzanine debt as well as other investment types. The depth of their prior experience and credit market experience has led them through various stages of the economic cycle as well as several market disruptions.

SLR Capital Management 
Pursuant to an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”), SLR Capital Management furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, SLR Capital Management also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders. In addition, SLR Capital Management assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. SLR Capital Management also provides managerial assistance, if any, on our behalf to those portfolio companies that request such assistance. 
License Agreement 
We have entered into a license agreement with SLR Capital Partners pursuant to which SLR Capital Partners has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “SLR” and “SOLAR”. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the SLR and SOLAR name for so long as the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with our investment adviser is in effect. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the “SLR” or “SOLAR” name. 
Market Opportunity 
The Company invests directly and indirectly in leveraged middle-market companies, including in senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities. We believe that the size of this market, coupled with leveraged companies’ need for flexible sources of capital at attractive terms and rates, creates an attractive investment environment for us. 

• | Middle-market companies continue to face increasing difficulty in accessing the capital markets. While many middle-market companies were formerly able to raise funds by issuing high-yield bonds, we believe this approach to financing has become more difficult in recent years as institutional investors have sought to invest in larger, more liquid offerings. In addition, many private finance companies that historically financed their lending and investing activities through securitization transactions have lost that source of funding and reduced lending significantly. Moreover, consolidation of lenders and market participants and the illiquid nature of investments have resulted in fewer middle-market lenders and market participants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional capital to support their investments. We believe there is more than $500 billion of uninvested private equity capital seeking debt financing to support acquisitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The significant amount of debt maturing through 2024 should provide additional demand for capital. A high volume of financings are expected to mature over the next few years. We believe that this supply of prospective lending opportunities coupled with a lack of available credit in the middle-market lending space may offer attractive risk-adjusted returns to investors. Risk-adjusted return compares returns against the amount of risk incurred. The term “risk-adjusted return” does not imply that an investment is no risk or low risk.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investing in private middle-market debt provides an attractive risk reward profile. In general, terms for illiquid, middle-market subordinated debt have been more attractive than those for larger corporations which are typically more liquid. We believe this is because fewer institutions are able to invest in illiquid asset classes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, we believe that there is an attractive opportunity to invest in leveraged middle-market companies, including in senior secured loans, unitranche loans and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities, and that we are well positioned to serve this market. 
Competitive Advantages and Strategy 
We believe that we have the following competitive advantages over other providers of financing to leveraged companies. 

3 


Management Experience 
As managing partner, Mr. Gross has principal management responsibility for SLR Capital Partners, to which he currently dedicates substantially all of his time. Mr. Gross has over 25 years of experience in leveraged finance, private equity and distressed debt investing. Mr. Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and a partner of SLR Capital Partners, has over 25 years of experience in evaluating and executing leveraged finance transactions. 
Investment Capacity 
The proceeds from our public offerings and the Concurrent Private Placement, the borrowing capacities under the senior secured credit facility led by Citibank, N.A. (the “Credit Facility”) and the SUNS SPV LLC senior secured credit facility (the “SPV Credit Facility”), our $75 million of unsecured senior notes due 2023 (the “2023 Unsecured Notes”), our $125 million of unsecured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Unsecured Notes”), our $85 million of unsecured notes due 2025 (the “2025 Unsecured Notes”), our $75 million of unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 Unsecured Notes”), our $50 million of unsecured senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Unsecured Notes”), our $135 million of unsecured notes due 2027 (the “2027 Series F Unsecured Notes”), the available capital at our significant subsidiaries and the expected repayments of existing portfolio company investments provide us with a substantial amount of capital available for deployment into new investment opportunities. We believe we are well positioned for the current marketplace. 
The Company’s Leverage 
As of December 31, 2022, we had total outstanding borrowings of approximately $1,093.2 million. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. As of December 31, 2022, our asset coverage ratio was 191.5%. We believe our relatively low level of leverage provides us with a competitive advantage as proceeds from our investments are available for reinvestment as opposed to being consumed by debt repayment. We may increase our relative level of debt in the future. However, we do not currently anticipate operating with a substantial amount of debt relative to our total assets. 
Proprietary Sourcing and Origination 
We believe that SLR Capital Partners’ senior investment professionals’ longstanding relationships with financial sponsors, commercial and investment banks, management teams and other financial intermediaries provide us with a strong pipeline of proprietary origination opportunities. We expect to continue leveraging the relationships Mr. Gross established while sourcing and originating investments at Apollo Investment Corporation as well as the financial sponsor relationships Mr. Spohler developed while he was a co-head of CIBC World Markets’ U.S. Leveraged Finance Group. 
Versatile Transaction Structuring and Flexibility of Capital 
We believe SLR Capital Partners’ senior investment team’s broad experience and ability to draw upon its extensive experience enable us to identify, assess and structure investments successfully across all levels of a company’s capital structure and to manage potential risk and return at all stages of the economic cycle. The attempt to manage risk does not imply low risk or no risk. While we are subject to significant regulation as a BDC, we are not subject to many of the regulatory limitations that govern traditional lending institutions such as banks. As a result, we believe that we can be more flexible than such lending institutions in selecting and structuring investments, adjusting investment criteria, transaction structures and, in some cases, the types of securities in which we invest. 
Emphasis on Achieving Strong Risk-Adjusted Returns 
SLR Capital Partners uses a structured investment and risk management process that emphasizes research and analysis. SLR Capital Partners seeks to build our portfolio on a “bottom-up” basis, choosing and sizing individual positions based on their relative risk/reward profiles as a function of the associated downside risk, volatility, correlation with the existing portfolio and liquidity. At the same time, SLR Capital Partners takes into consideration a variety of factors in managing our portfolio and imposes portfolio-based risk constraints promoting a more diverse portfolio of investments and limiting issuer and industry concentration. We do not pursue short-term origination targets. We believe this approach enables us to build an attractive investment portfolio that meets our return and value criteria over the long term. We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets. In evaluating new investments we, through SLR Capital Partners, conduct a rigorous due diligence process. 

4 


Dedication of Resources to Industries with Substantial Information Flow 
We dedicate our investing resources to industries characterized by strong cash flow and in which SLR Capital Partners’ investment professionals have deep investment experience. As a result of their investment experience, Messrs. Gross and Spohler, together with SLR Capital Partners’ other senior investment professionals, have long-term relationships with management consultants and management teams in the industries we target, as well as substantial information concerning those industries. 
Longer Investment Horizon 
Unlike private equity and venture capital funds, we will not be subject to standard periodic capital return requirements. Such requirements typically stipulate that the capital of these funds, together with any capital gains on such invested funds, can only be invested once and must be returned to investors after a pre-agreed time period. We believe that our flexibility to make investments with a long-term view and without the capital return requirements of traditional private investment vehicles provides us with the opportunity to generate favorable returns relative to the risks of our invested capital and enables us to be a better long-term partner for our portfolio companies. 
Investments 
The Company seeks to create a diverse portfolio that includes senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent unsecured loans and equity securities by investing approximately $5 million to $100 million of capital, on average, in the securities of leveraged companies, including middle-market companies. We expect that this investment size will vary with the size of our capital base and/or for strategic initiatives. Structurally, unsecured loans usually rank subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. However, unsecured loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrower’s capital structure. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to senior loans, unsecured loans generally earn a higher return than senior secured loans. 
In addition to senior secured loans and unsecured loans, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our returns to our investors. These investments may include direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States. The securities that we invest in are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are speculative and are often referred to as “leveraged loans,” “high yield” or “junk” securities, and may be considered “high risk” compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade. In addition, some of our debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which means that a borrower may be unable to payoff its debt due to bankruptcy or other reasons and therefore we may write-off such debt investment prior to its scheduled maturity. Upon such an occurrence, we may realize a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. We may invest up to 30% of our total assets in such opportunistic investments, including loans issued by non-U.S. issuers, subject to compliance with our regulatory obligations as a BDC under the 1940 Act. 
We have and will continue to borrow funds to make investments. As a result, we will be exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for loss on amounts invested and therefore increases the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in management fees payable to our investment adviser, SLR Capital Partners, will be borne by our common stockholders. 
Moreover, we may acquire investments in the secondary market and, in analyzing such investments, we will seek to employ a substantially similar analytical process as we use for our primary investments. 
We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. 

5 


 Our principal focus is to provide senior secured loans to leveraged companies in a variety of industries. We generally seek to target companies that generate positive cash flows and/or have substantial assets that secure our loans. We generally seek to invest in companies from the broad variety of industries in which our investment adviser has direct experience. 
The following is a representative list of the industries in which we may invest: 


• Aerospace & Defense • Air Freight & Logistics • Airlines • Asset Management • Automobiles • Auto Components • Auto Parts & Equipment • Biotechnology • Building Products • Capital Markets • Chemicals • Commercial Services & Supplies • Communications Equipment • Construction & Engineering • Consumer Finance • Containers & Packaging • Distributors • Diversified Consumer Services • Diversified Financial Services • Diversified Real Estate Activities • Diversified Telecommunications Services • Education Services • Energy Equipment & Services • Food Products • Food & Staples Retailing • Footwear • Health Care Equipment & Supplies • Health Care Facilities • Health Care Providers & Services • Health Care Technology • Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure | • Household & Personal Products • Industrial Conglomerates • Insurance • Internet & Catalog Retail • Internet Software & Services • IT Services • Leisure Equipment & Products • Life Sciences Tools & Services • Machinery • Media • Metals & Mining • Multiline Retail • Multi-Sector Holdings • Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels • Packaged Foods & Meats • Paper & Forest Products • Personal Products • Pharmaceuticals • Professional Services • Research & Consulting Services • Road & Rail • Software • Specialty Retail • Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods • Thrifts & Mortgage Finance • Trading Companies & Distributors • Transportation Infrastructure • Water Utilities • Wireless Telecommunications Services 

We may also invest in other industries if we are presented with attractive opportunities. 
We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds. We may also participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, each of whose investment adviser is SLR Capital Partners, or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with SLR Capital Partners and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the most recent exemptive order obtained from the SEC on June 13, 2017 (the “Exemptive Order”). Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. 
At December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of 139 portfolio companies and was invested 30.8% in cash flow senior secured loans, 30.0% in asset-based senior secured loans / SLR Credit Solutions (“SLR Credit”) / SLR Healthcare ABL / SLR Business Credit, 23.7% in equipment senior secured financings / SLR Equipment Finance (“SLR Equipment”) / Kingsbridge Holdings, LLC (“KBH”) and 15.5% in life science senior secured loans, in each case, measured at fair value. We expect that our portfolio will 

6 


continue to include primarily senior secured loans, financing leases and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities. In addition, we also expect to invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our risk-adjusted returns to stockholders. These investments may include, but are not limited to, securities of public companies and debt and equity securities of companies located outside of the United States. 
While our primary investment objective is to maximize current income and capital appreciation through investments in U.S. senior and subordinated loans, other debt securities and equity, we may also invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments, including foreign securities. 
Listed below are our top ten portfolio companies and industries based on their fair value and represented as a percentage of total assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Set forth below is a brief description of each portfolio company in which we have made an investment that represents greater than 5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2022. 
SLR Credit Solutions 
We invested in SLR Credit as an independent commercial finance company that provides primarily senior secured loans for both asset-based and cash flow financings to middle-market companies. Its team of experienced, responsive professionals has underwritten, closed and managed more than $20 billion in secured debt commitments across a wide range of industries. As of December 31, 2022, SLR Credit had 29 funded commitments to 25 different issuers with total funded loans of approximately $439.5 million on total assets of $460.7 million. SLR Credit’s competitors include other specialty finance companies and small banks. As with most finance companies, SLR Credit is exposed to interest rate risk, which it mostly mitigates by issuing loans with floating rates. 
SLR Equipment Finance 
On July 31, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of NEF Holdings, which conducts its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary Nations Equipment Finance, LLC. Effective February 25, 2021, Nations Equipment Finance, LLC and its related companies are doing business as SLR Equipment Finance. SLR Equipment is an independent equipment finance company that provides senior secured loans and leases primarily to U.S. based companies. The Company invested $209.9 million in cash to effect the transaction, of which $145.0 million was invested in the equity of SLR Equipment through our wholly-owned consolidated taxable subsidiary NEFCORP LLC and our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary NEFPASS LLC and $64.9 million was used to purchase certain leases and loans held by SLR Equipment through NEFPASS LLC. As of December 31, 2022, SLR Equipment had 131 funded equipment-backed leases and loans to 59 different customers with a total net investment in leases and loans of approximately $190.8 million on total assets of $241.8 million. 
Kingsbridge Holdings, LLC 
On November 3, 2020, the Company acquired 87.5% of the equity securities of Kingsbridge Holdings, LLC (“KBH”) through KBH Topco LLC (“KBHT”), a Delaware corporation. KBH is a residual focused independent mid-ticket lessor of equipment primarily to U.S. investment grade companies. The Company invested $216.6 million to effect the transaction, of which $136.6 million was invested to acquire 87.5% of KBHT’s equity and $80.0 million in KBH’s debt. The existing management team of KBH committed to continuing to lead KBH after the transaction. Post the transaction, the Company owns 87.5% of KBHT equity and the KBH management team owns the remaining 12.5% of KBHT’s equity. As of December 31, 2022, KBHT had total assets of $777.2 million.

Investment Selection Process 
SLR Capital Partners is committed to and utilizes a value-oriented investment philosophy with a focus on the preservation of capital and a commitment to managing downside exposure. 
Portfolio Company Characteristics 
We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. 
Stable Earnings and Strong Free Cash Flow. We seek to invest in companies that have demonstrated stable earnings through economic cycles. We target companies that can de-lever through consistent generation of cash flows rather than relying solely on growth to service and repay our loans. 
Value Orientation. Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis from an investor’s perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We focus on companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that are profitable at the time of investment on an operating cash flow basis. 
Value of Assets. The prospective value of the assets, if any, that collateralizes the loans in which we invest, is an important factor in our credit analysis. Our analysis emphasizes both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases. In some of our transactions the company’s fundings may be derived from a borrowing base determined by the value of the company’s assets. 
Strong Competitive Position in Industry. We seek to invest in target companies that have developed leading market positions within their respective markets and are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We seek companies that demonstrate significant competitive advantages versus their competitors, which we believe should help to protect their market position and profitability. 
Diversified Customer and Supplier Base. We seek to invest in businesses that have a diversified customer and supplier base. We believe that companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation, changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers, suppliers and competitors. 
Exit Strategy. We predominantly invest in companies that provide multiple alternatives for an eventual exit. We look for opportunities that provide an exit typically within three years of the initial capital commitment. 
We generally seek companies that we believe will have or provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans and reinvest in their respective businesses. We believe that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of our interest, and the repayment of our principal, represents a key means by which we will be able to exit from our investments over time. 
In addition, we also seek to invest in companies whose business models and expected future cash flows or cash positions offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or another capital market transaction. We underwrite our investments on a held-to-maturity basis, but expensive capital is often repaid prior to stated maturity. 
Experienced and Committed Management. We generally require that portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also require portfolio companies have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests. 
Strong Sponsorship. We generally aim to invest alongside other sophisticated investors. We typically seek to partner with successful financial sponsors who have historically generated high returns. We believe that investing in these sponsors’ portfolio companies enables us to benefit from their direct involvement and due diligence. 
SLR Capital Partners’ investment team works in concert with sponsors to proactively manage investment opportunities by acting as a partner throughout the investment process. We actively focus on the middle-market financial sponsor community, with a particular focus on the upper-end of the middle-market (sponsors with equity funds of $500 million to $5 billion). We favor such sponsors because they typically: 


• | buy larger companies with strong business franchises;
--+------------------------------------------------------


9 


 
• | invest significant amounts of equity in their portfolio companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | value flexibility and creativity in structuring their transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possess longer track records over multiple investment funds;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | have a deeper management bench;
--+--------------------------------


• | have better ability to withstand downturns; and
--+------------------------------------------------


• | possess the ability to support portfolio companies with additional capital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We divide our coverage of these sponsors among our more senior investment professionals, who are responsible for day-to-day interaction with financial sponsors. Our coverage approach aims to act proactively, consider all investments in the capital structure, provide quick feedback, deliver on commitments, and are constructive throughout the life cycle of an investment. 
Due Diligence 
Our “private equity” approach to credit investing typically incorporates extensive in-depth due diligence often alongside the private equity sponsor. In conducting due diligence, we will use publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers. We believe that our due diligence methodology allows us to screen a high volume of potential investment opportunities on a consistent and thorough basis. 
Our due diligence typically includes: 


• | review of historical and prospective financial information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | review and valuation of assets;
--+--------------------------------


• | research relating to the company’s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | on-site visits;
--+----------------


• | discussions with management, employees, customers or vendors of the potential portfolio company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of senior loan documents; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | background investigations.
--+---------------------------

We also expect to evaluate the private equity sponsor making the investment. Further, due to SLR Capital Partners’ considerable repeat business with sponsors, we have direct experience with the management teams of many sponsors. A private equity sponsor is typically the controlling stockholder upon completion of an investment and as such is considered critical to the success of the investment. The equity sponsor is evaluated along several key criteria, including: 


• | investment track record;
--+-------------------------


• | industry experience;
--+---------------------


• | capacity and willingness to provide additional financial support to the company through additional capital contributions, if necessary; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reference checks.
--+------------------

Throughout the due diligence process, a deal team is in constant dialogue with the management team of the company in which we are considering investing to ensure that any concerns are addressed as early as possible through the process and that unsuitable investments are filtered out before considerable time has been invested. 
Upon the completion of due diligence and a decision to proceed with an investment in a company, the investment professionals leading the investment present the investment opportunity to SLR Capital Partners’ investment committee, which then determines whether to pursue the potential investment. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and independent accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.

 The Investment Committee 
All new investments are required to be approved by a consensus of the investment committee of SLR Capital Partners, which is led by Messrs. Gross and Spohler. The members of SLR Capital Partners’ investment committee receive no compensation from us. Such members may be employees or partners of SLR Capital Partners and may receive compensation or profit distributions from SLR Capital Partners. 
Investment Structure 
Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure. 
The Company seeks to create a diverse portfolio that includes senior secured loans and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities by investing approximately $5 million to $100 million of capital. With respect to our senior secured loans, we seek to obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. 
We structure our unsecured loans primarily subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed or floating interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal, if any, deferred to the later years of the unsecured loans. In some cases, we may enter into loans that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases our unsecured loans may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. 
Typically, our senior secured and unsecured loans have final maturities of five to ten years. However, we expect that our portfolio companies often may repay these loans early, generally within three to four years from the date of initial investment. In some cases and when available, we seek to structure these loans with prepayment premiums to capture foregone interest. 
In the case of our senior secured and unsecured loan investments, we tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior or fulcrum position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we will seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 

• | requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential capital appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | incorporating “put” rights and call protection into the investment structure; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity securities, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights. In addition, we may from time to time make direct equity investments in portfolio companies. 
We generally seek to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but will sell our investments earlier, including if a liquidity event takes place such as the sale or recapitalization of a portfolio company. 

11 


Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies 
SLR Capital Partners monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. SLR Capital Partners monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. 
SLR Capital Partners has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which include the following: 


• | Assessment of success in adhering to each portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comparisons to other SLR invested portfolio companies in the industry, if any;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attendance at and participation in board meetings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, SLR Capital Partners also uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. 
We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 


InvestmentRating | Summary Description 
1 | Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio, the portfolio company is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable (including a potential exit) 
2 | Risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination, the portfolio company is performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable; all new investments are initially assessed a grade of 2
3 | The portfolio company is performing below expectations, may be out of compliance with debt covenants, and requires procedures for closer monitoring 
4 | The investment is performing well below expectations and is not anticipated to be repaid in full 

SLR Capital Partners monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the weighted average investment rating on the fair market value of our portfolio was a 2. In connection with our valuation process, SLR Capital Partners reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. 
Valuation Procedures 
In December 2020, the SEC adopted new Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act addressing fair valuation of fund investments. The new rule sets forth requirements for good faith determinations of fair value, as well as for the performance of fair value determinations, including related oversight and reporting obligations. The new rule also defines “readily available market quotations” for purposes of the definition of “value” under the 1940 Act, and the SEC noted that this definition will apply in all contexts under the 1940 Act. The Company will comply with Rule 2a-5’s valuation requirements. 
We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined, at all times consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 
Under procedures established by the Board, we value investments, including certain senior secured debt, subordinated debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). A market quotation is readily available for a security only when that quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that the Company can access at the measurement date, provided 

12 


that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable. If the Company anticipates using a market quotation for a security, it will also monitor for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, such as significant events that may cause concern over the reliability of a market quotation. We attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative. If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, we may utilize independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair value of material assets. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each such case, independent valuation firms, which may from time to time be engaged by the Board, consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board. Such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. 
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Board has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 


(1) | our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | independent valuation firms engaged by the Board conduct independent appraisals and review the Investment Adviser’s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment for all material assets;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | the audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuation of the Investment Adviser and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm, if any, to reflect any comments; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | the Board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firm, if any, and the audit committee.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. However, in accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946, may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation approaches to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, there has been no change to the Company’s valuation approaches or techniques and the nature of the related inputs considered in the valuation process. 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: 
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at the measurement date. 
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The exercise of judgment is based in part on our knowledge of the asset class and our prior experience. 

13 


Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements. 
Competition 
Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies can be intense. While many middle-market companies were previously able to raise senior debt financing through traditional large financial institutions, we believe this approach to financing will become more difficult as implementation of U.S. and international financial reforms limits the capacity of large financial institutions to hold non-investment grade leveraged loans on their balance sheets. We believe that many of these financial institutions have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market companies in particular. 
Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. We use the industry information available to Messrs. Gross and Spohler and the other investment professionals of SLR Capital Partners to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of Messrs. Gross and Spohler and the other investment professionals of our investment adviser enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive leveraged companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. 
Staffing 
We do not currently have any employees. Mr. Gross, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mr. Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and board member, are managing members and senior investment professionals of, and have financial and controlling interests in, SLR Capital Partners. In addition, Mr. Richard Peteka, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary serves as the Chief Financial Officer for SLR Capital Partners. Guy Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer, is a Managing Director of ACA Group, LLC, and performs his functions as our Chief Compliance Officer under the terms of an agreement between SLR Capital Management and ACA Group, LLC. SLR Capital Management has retained Mr. Talarico and ACA Group, LLC pursuant to its obligations under our Administration Agreement. 
Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by SLR Capital Partners. Based upon its needs, SLR Capital Partners may hire additional investment professionals. In addition, we will reimburse SLR Capital Management for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, and the allocable portion of the cost of the company’s chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securites Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), our co-chief executive officers and chief financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management is required to prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and to obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


14 


The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
Business Development Company Regulations 
A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to those investments that constitute qualifying assets (as discussed below). A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly-traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. 
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, reflecting the value of our total assets to our total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 150%. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 
We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share without annual stockholder approval. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if the Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. At this time, we do not have stockholder approval for such sales. 
As a BDC, we were substantially limited in our ability to co-invest in privately negotiated transactions with affiliated funds until we obtained an exemptive order from the SEC. The most recent exemptive order, received on June 13, 2017 (the “Exemptive Order”), permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, each of whose investment adviser is an investment adviser that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with SLR Capital Partners and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions to the Exemptive Order. If we are unable to rely on the Exemptive Order for a particular opportunity, such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than one entity’s investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although our investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and our common stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of our investment adviser. 
We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the federal securities laws, including the 1940 Act. 
Qualifying Assets 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 

15 


 (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC); and 
(c) satisfies any of the following: 
i. does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 
ii. has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; 
iii. is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 
iv. is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million. 
(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control, which, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. 
(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
(7) Office furniture and equipment, interests in real estate and leasehold improvements and facilities maintained to conduct the business operations of the BDC, deferred organization and operating expenses, and other noninvestment assets necessary and appropriate to its operations as a BDC, including notes of indebtedness of directors, officers, employees, and general partners held by a BDC as payment for securities of such company issued in connection with an executive compensation plan described in Section 57(j) of the 1940 Act. 
Under Section 55(b) of the 1940 Act, the value of a BDC’s assets shall be determined as of the date of the most recent financial statements filed by such company with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 of the 1934 Act, and shall be determined no less frequently than annually. 
Significant Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies that constitute qualifying assets. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may also receive fees for these services. SLR Capital Management provides such managerial assistance, if any, on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 
Temporary Investments 
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality investment grade debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. SLR Capital Partners will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

16 


Senior Securities 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while certain senior securities remain outstanding, we may be required to make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. We may borrow money, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. 
Code of Ethics 
We and SLR Capital Partners have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our codes of ethics generally do not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. Each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the codes of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following Email address: publicinfo@sec.gov. 
Compliance Policies and Procedures 
We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws. We are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and to designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for their administration. Guy Talarico currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser. A summary of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, SLR Capital Partners has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote securities held by its clients in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
Our investment adviser votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of our stockholders. SLR Capital Partners reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a proxy vote to determine its impact on our investments. Although it generally votes against proposals that may have a negative impact on our investments, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. The proxy voting decisions of our investment adviser are made by the senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to a managing member of SLR Capital Partners any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote, and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: SLR Capital Partners, LLC, 500 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. 
Privacy Principles 
We endeavor to maintain the privacy of our recordholders and to safeguard their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share such information with select other parties. 
Generally, we will not receive any non-public personal information about the recordholders of the common stock of the Company, although certain of our recordholders’ non-public information may become available to us. The non-public personal information that we may receive falls into the following categories: 

17 


 
• | Information we receive from recordholders, whether we receive it orally, in writing or electronically. This includes recordholders’ communications to us concerning their investment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Information about recordholders’ transaction history with us; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other general information that we may obtain about recordholders, such as demographic and contact information such as address.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We disclose non-public person information about recordholders: 


• | to our affiliates (such as SLR and our administrator) and their employees for everyday business purposes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to our service providers (such as our accountants, attorneys, custodians, transfer agent, underwriter and proxy solicitors) and their employees as is necessary to service recordholder accounts or otherwise provide the applicable service;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to comply with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests, or other legal or regulatory requirements; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | as allowed or required by applicable law or regulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

When the Company shares non-public recordholder personal information referred to above, the information is made available for limited business purposes and under controlled circumstances designed to protect our recordholders’ privacy. The Company does not permit use of recordholder information for any non- business or marketing purpose, nor does the Company permit third parties to rent, sell, trade or otherwise release or disclose information to any other party. 
The Company’s service providers, such as SLR, its administrator, and its transfer agent, are required to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect recordholder non-public personal information; to prevent unauthorized access or use; and to dispose of such information when it is no longer required. 
Personnel of affiliates may access recordholder information only for business purposes. The degree of access is based on the sensitivity of the information and on personnel need for the information to service a recordholder’s account or comply with legal requirements. 
If a recordholder ceases to be a recordholder, we will adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described above. We may choose to modify our privacy policies at any time. Before we do so, we will notify recordholders and provide a description of our privacy policy. 
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
As a BDC, we elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). If we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed not distributed) to our stockholders. 
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). 

18 


In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 


• | at all times during each taxable year, have in effect an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or currencies, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and (b) net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership;” and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) the securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) the securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) income or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
Because we may use debt financing, we will be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources or are otherwise limited in our ability to make distributions, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% gross income test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions. 
Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term will depend on how long we have held a particular warrant. Upon the exercise of a warrant acquired by us, our tax basis in the stock purchased under the warrant will equal the sum of the amount paid for the warrant plus the strike price paid on the exercise of the warrant. 
Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company 
If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required. Such distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as dividends and, provided certain holding period and other requirements were met, could qualify for treatment as “qualified dividend income” in the hands of non-corporate stockholders (and thus eligible for the current 20% maximum rate) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent 5 years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.

Investment Advisory Fees 
Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay SLR Capital Partners a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and a performance-based incentive fee. 
The base management fee is determined by taking the average value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% on gross assets up to 200% of the Company’s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter end and 1.00% on gross assets that exceed 200% of the Company’s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter end. For purposes of computing the base management fee, gross assets exclude temporary assets acquired at the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility in the next fiscal quarter. Temporary assets include, but are not limited to, U.S. treasury bills, other short-term U.S. government or government agency securities, repurchase agreements or cash borrowings. 
The performance-based incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to SLR Capital Management, and any interest expense and dividend paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the performance-based incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay in kind income and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.50% base management fee. We pay SLR Capital Partners an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 


• | no performance-based incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 1.75%;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.1875%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is meant to provide our investment adviser with 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to SLR Capital Partners (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to SLR Capital Partners).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the performance-based incentive fee: 
Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 



20 


 Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income 
allocated to SLR Capital Partners 
These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. 
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*): 
Alternative 1: 
Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 
Management fee(2) = 0.375% 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20% 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.675% 
Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 
Alternative 2: 
Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70% 
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 
Management fee(2) = 0.375% 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20% 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.125% 
Incentive fee = 100% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the “catch-up”(4)
= 100% × (2.125% – 1.75%) 
= 0.375% 
Alternative 3: 
Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.00% 
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 
Management fee(2) = 0.375% 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20% 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.425% 
Incentive fee = 20% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up”(4)
Incentive fee = 100% × “catch-up” + (20% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income – 2.1875%)) 
Catch-up = 2.1875% – 1.75% 

21 


= 0.4375% 
Incentive fee = (100% × 0.4375%) + (20% × (2.425% – 2.1875%)) 
= 0.4375% + (20% × 0.2375%) 
= 0.4375% + 0.0475% 
= 0.485% 



(*) | The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. 
(1) | Represents 7% annualized hurdle rate. 
(2) | Represents 1.50% annualized management fee. 
(3) | Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 
(4) | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter.

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee: 
Alternative 1: 
Assumptions 


• | Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B was determined to be $32 million
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million
--+------------------------------------------

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 


• | Year 1: None
--+-------------


• | Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on the sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 3: None
--+-------------

$5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 


• | Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000
--+------------------------------------------------

$6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains fee taken in Year 2) 
Alternative 2: 
Assumptions 


• | Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


22 


 
• | Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million
--+------------------------------------------

The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 


• | Year 1: None
--+-------------


• | Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee
--+-----------------------------------------------

20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 


• | Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee(1)
--+----------------------------------------------------

$6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains fee received in Year 2 


• | Year 4: None
--+-------------


• | Year 5: None
--+-------------

$5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 


(1) | As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 2 above, if the Company were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year, the Company may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if the Company had been wound up on December 31 of such year.
