ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Company Overview

Overview

Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Issuer Direct”, the “Company”, “We” or “Our” unless otherwise noted. Our corporate headquarters are located at One Glenwood Ave., Suite 1001, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27603.

We announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website, SEC filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls, webcasts and social media. We use these channels to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services and other related matters. It is possible that information we post on some of these channels could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media and others interested in Issuer Direct to review the information we post to all our channels, including our social media accounts.

We are a leading communications and compliance company, providing solutions for both public relations and investor relations professionals. Our comprehensive solutions are used by thousands of customers from emerging startups to multi-billion-dollar global brands, ensuring their most important moments are reaching the right audiences, via our industry leading newswire, IR website solutions, events technology and compliance solutions. Our platform efficiently and effectively helps our customers manage their events when seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. 

Our platform consists of several related but distinct Communications and Compliance modules that companies and customers utilize every quarter. As such, we disclose or revenue in the following two main categories: (i) Communications and (ii) Compliance. Set forth below is an infographic depicting the products included in each of these two main categories we provide today:


Over the next several years, we expect the Communications portion of our business to continue to increase, both in terms of overall revenue and as compared to the Compliance portion of our business as it has done in the past. Therefore, we plan to continue to invest in offerings we intend to incorporate into our Communications product lineup. Within most of our target markets, customers require several individual services and/or software providers to meet their investor relations and communications needs. We believe our platform can address all these needs in a single, secure, cloud-based platform - one that offers a customer control, increases efficiencies, demonstrates clear value and, most importantly, delivers consistent and compliant messaging from one centralized platform.

We work with a diverse customer base, which includes not only corporate issuers and private companies, but also investment banks, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms, as well as the accounting and legal communities. Our customers and their service providers utilize our platform and related solutions from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, news outlets, financial platforms, and our customers’ shareholders. Private companies primarily use our news distribution, newsroom and webcasting products and services to disseminate their message globally. 

We also work with several select stock exchanges by making available certain parts of our platform under agreements to integrate our offerings within their products. We believe such partnerships will continue to yield increased exposure to a targeted customer base that could impact our revenue and overall brand in the market.

Communications

Our Communications platform consists of our press release distribution businesses branded as ACCESSWIRE and Newswire, our webcasting and events business, professional conference and events software, as well as our investor relations website technology. We are currently in the process of integrating the ACCESSWIRE and Newswire news distribution platforms into one system that will give our customers all of the benefits of both systems combined into one. These products are sold as the leading part of our Communications subscription, as well as individually to customers around the globe and are further described below.

Acquisition of iNewswire.com LLC

On November 1, 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of iNewswire.com LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Newswire”).  Newswire is a media technology company that provides customers press release distribution, media databases, media monitoring, and newsrooms for greater brand awareness through earned media, increased online visibility through greater search engine optimization recognition, and more sales inquiries through targeted digital marketing campaigns. Through its Media Advantage Platform (“MAP”), Newswire automates media and marketing communications for large and small businesses seeking to deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time for the right purpose. 

We believe this transaction strengthens our entire communications portfolio and combined with our ACCESSWIRE business, grows our press release distribution business to now be one of North America's largest press release distribution platforms. The acquisition almost doubles our press release customer base and combines what we believe are qualified people and strong distribution, technology and brands. Newswire customers will benefit from the global footprint ACCESSWIRE has built over the last seven years, whereas Issuer Direct's customers will have access to Newswire's brand-new media database platform, analytics, as well as its MAP. Lastly, we believe the acquisition will also result in meaningful operational synergies in the combined company.

Through the MAP product, Newswire provides a media and marketing communications utility that converts customers’ owned media into earned media opportunities to accelerate business growth. The MAP Market Builder provides integrated media and marketing communications programs aimed to increase site traffic, qualified leads and lowering cost of acquisition for new accounts.

ACCESSWIRE

Our existing press release offering, which is marketed under the brand ACCESSWIRE, is a news dissemination and media outreach service. The ACCESSWIRE product offering focuses on press release distribution for both private and public companies globally. We believe ACCESSWIRE is becoming a competitive alternative in the newswire industry because we have been able to use our technological advancements to allow customers to self-edit releases or use our editorial staff as desired to edit releases. We continue to expand our distribution points, improve our targeting and enhance our analytics reporting. We also offer an e-commerce element to our ACCESSWIRE product, whereby customers can self-select their distribution, register, and then upload their press release for editorial review in minutes. We believe these enhancements have helped increase ACCESSWIRE revenues each year compared to the prior year, a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. We have also been able to maintain high gross margins while providing our customer flexible pricing, with options to pay per release or enter longer-term agreements for a designated package of releases.

Like other newswires globally, ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon several key partners for its news distribution. Disruption in any of our partnerships could have a materially adverse impact on ACCESSWIRE and our overall business.

Newsroom

A natural expansion to our ACCESSWIRE and investor relations website business is our corporate Newsroom, which we brought to market during the third quarter of 2021. This product offering can be an add-on to any customer’s ACCESSWIRE or Communications subscription account. The Newsroom suite includes a custom newsroom page builder, a brand asset manager and contact manager.

Our Newsroom suite addresses the needs of our customers looking to build connections with media, journalists, customers and if applicable the investment community. According to a survey from TekGroup, a majority of journalists and media professionals indicated the importance of newsrooms that include digital media, press kits and video. We believe our Newsroom suite accomplishes this by including the following three components:

Newsroom page – a custom URL, self-publishing system for customers that automatically adds ACCESSWIRE news to their newsroom and allows them the ability to add any other mention, article or post from the web to their newsroom. Customers can self-manage this platform to customize colors, font, logo, images, social integration, and contact and customer URLs.

Brand Asset Manager – a customizable library of images, video and press kits, which can be shared both privately and publicly, as well as integrated into the ACCESSWIRE editor for easy access of customers’ high- resolution images. All assets are tagged to give our customers analytics for both views and downloads. Subsequent versions of this feature will allow for greater analytics as engagement occurs with our customers’ assets.
Contact Manager – a technology that allows our customers to provide their audiences the ability to quickly subscribe to alerts or notifications of a particular brand. Customers have the ability to deliver their stories automatically or time based. Engagement and delivery reports are also available to customers directly from their dashboard.
Webcasting & Events

Our webcasting and events business is comprised of our earnings call webcasting solutions and our virtual meeting and events software (such as annual meetings, deal/non-deal road shows, analyst days and shareholder days). The demand for these products with a virtual component was at an all-time high for us in 2020, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry overall has begun to see a reduction in the number of virtual events, specifically annual meetings and deal/non-deal roadshows, as customers are relying on internal enterprise solutions or are returning to pre-pandemic travel and in-person meetings, reducing the need for a virtual component. This has contributed to a decline in demand for our virtual components since prior years.  

Traditional earnings calls and webcasts are a highly competitive market with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in investor relations and communications firms. We estimate there are approximately 5,000 companies in North America conducting earnings events each quarter that include a teleconference, webcast or both as part of their events. Our platform incorporates other elements of the earnings event, including earnings date/call announcement, earnings press release and SEC Form 8-K filings. There are a handful of our competitors that can offer this integrated full-service solution today, however, we believe our real-time event setup and integrated approach offers a more effective way to manage the process.

Additionally, as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform, we broadcast live additional companies’ earnings events, whether they are conducted on our platform or not, within our shareholder outreach module, which helps drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event. During the first half of 2021, we released the first version of this real-time engagement and analytics dashboard to our customers.

Our VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”) is a cloud-based webcast, webinar and virtual meeting platform that delivers live and on-demand streaming of events to audiences of all sizes. VWP allows customers to create, produce and deliver events, which we feel has significantly strengthened our webcasting product and Communications offering. The VWP technology gives us the ability to host thousands of webcasts each year, expanding and diversifying our webcast business from our historical earnings-based events to include any type of virtual event. As we expand our platform, it is vital for us to have solutions that service both our core public companies but also a growing segment of private customers. 

Professional Conference and Events Software

Our professional conference and events software is a subscription offering we currently license to investor conference organizers, which in the aggregate we believe held an estimated 1,000 plus events a year prior to 2020. This number significantly decreased in 2020 and is expected to remain at decreased levels in the near future, however in-person events began to increase throughout 2022. This software, which is also available as a native mobile app, offers organizers, issuers and investors the ability to register, request and approve one-on-one meetings, manage schedules, perform event promotion and sponsorship, print attendee badges and manage lodging. This cloud-based product can be used in a virtual or in person conference setting and is integrated within our Communications subscription offerings of newswire, newsrooms, webcasting and shareholder targeting. We believe this integration gives us a unique offering for professional conference organizers that is not available elsewhere in the market. We believe this software helps make our platform a platform of choice for investment banks, issuers and investors. 
Investor Relations Websites

Our investor relations content network is another component of our Communications offering, which is used to create the investor relations’ tab of a company’s website. This investor relations content network is a robust series of data feeds including news feeds, stock feeds, fundamentals, regulatory filings, corporate governance and many other components which are aggregated from most of the major exchanges and news distribution outlets around the world. Customers can subscribe to one or more of these data feeds or as a component of a fully designed and hosted website for pre-IPO companies, SEC reporting companies and partners seeking to display our content on their corporate sites. The clear benefit to our investor relations content network is its integration with our other Communications offerings. As such, companies can produce content for public distribution and it is automatically linked to their corporate website, distributed to targeted groups and placed into our data feed partners.
Compliance

Our Compliance offerings consist of our disclosure software for financial reporting, stock transfer services, and related annual meeting, print and shareholder distribution services. Some of these products are sold as part of a Compliance subscription as well as individually to customers around the globe.
Disclosure Software and Services

Our disclosure reporting module is a document conversion, editing and filing offering which is designed for reporting companies and professionals seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filing processes to the SEC’s EDGAR system. Our disclosure business also offers companies the ability to use our in-house staff to assist in the conversion, tagging and filing of their documents. We generate revenues in disclosure both from software and services and, in most cases, customers have both components within their annual agreements, while others pay for services as they are completed.

Our Inline XBRL (Inline Extensible Business Reporting Language or “iXBRL”) product now includes upgrades that meet newly mandated SEC disclosure requirements which became effective in 2021.

Whistleblower Hotline

Our whistleblower hotline is an add-on product within our platform. This system delivers secure notifications and basic incident workflow management processes that align with a company’s corporate governance whistleblower policy. As a supported and subsidized bundle product of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) offerings, we are introduced to new IPO customers and other larger cap customers listed on the NYSE. Since 2014, we have been a named NYSE subsidy provider of this Whistleblower solution. In 2020, NYSE renewed and extended the initial subsidy term to four years from two years, whereby the first two years are provided under subsidy and the added two years are at our standard subscription rates. Recently, we have been working on upgrading the incident response and management component of the workflow, which is expected to be completed in 2023.

Stock Transfer Module

A valued subscription add-on in our Compliance offering is the ability for our customers to gain access to real-time information about their shareholders, stock ledgers and reports and to issue new shares from our cloud-based stock transfer module. Managing the capitalization table of a public company or pre-IPO company is a cornerstone of corporate governance and transparency, and as such companies and community banks have chosen us to assist with their stock transfer needs, including bond offerings and dividend management. This is an industry which has experienced declining overall revenues as it was affected by the replacement of paper certificates with digital certificates. However, we have been focused on selling subscriptions of the stock transfer component of our platform, allowing customers to gain access to our cloud-based system in order to move shares or query shareholders, which we believe has resulted in a more efficient process for both our customers and us.
Annual Meeting / Proxy Voting Platform

Our proxy module is marketed as a fully integrated, real-time voting platform for our customers and their shareholders of record. This module is utilized for every annual meeting or special meeting we manage for our customers and offers both full-set mailing and notice of internet availability options.

This module has been incorporated within our webcasting offering to enable our customers the ability to conduct their annual meetings in-person or fully virtual, which has often been required since the COVID-19 pandemic. Our solution incorporates shareholder and guest registration, voting integration, real-time statistics on attendance, audio video and presentation features as well as fully managed meeting managers and inspector of elections. Although we believe a virtual component to an annual meeting is both a benefit to all shareholders and a corporate governance advantage, there can be no assurances this product has longevity in the market.

Shareholder Distribution

Over the past few years, we have worked on refining the model of digital distribution of our customers’ message to the investment community and beyond. This was accomplished by integrating our shareholder outreach module, Investor Network, into and with our Compliance offerings. Most of the customers subscribing to this module today are historical PrecisionIR (“PIR”) – Annual Report Service (“ARS”) users, as well as new customers purchasing the entire platform subscription. We migrated some of the customers from the traditional ARS business into this new digital subscription business, however, we continue to operate a portion of this legacy physical hard copy delivery of annual reports and prospectuses for customers who opt to take advantage of it. We continue to see customer attrition for customers who subscribe to both the electronic and physical distribution of reports as a stand-alone product.

Our overall strategy includes:

Expansion of Customer Base

We expect to continue to see demand for our products within our customer base and in the industries we serve. We continue to focus on migrating customer contracts to subscription-based contracts that are typically with terms of one year or greater. We believe this will help us move from a transaction-based revenue model to a recurring subscription-based revenue model, which may give us more consistent, predictable revenue patterns and hopefully create longer lasting customer relationships.

 Additionally, as part of our customer expansion efforts, we are committed to working beyond the single point of contact and into the entire C suite (CEO, CFO, IRO, CMO, Corporate Communications Director, Corporate Secretary, etc.) of an organization which we believe will help drive subscription revenues per customer.

Our primary growth strategy continues to be selling our communications solutions to new customers under a subscription arrangement, whereas in the past we were inclined to sell a single point solution. Selling a subscription to our Communications platform allows us to provide our customers with a competitively priced, complete solution for their communications needs. Our strategy of selling our cloud-based offerings via our platform to all customers under a subscription agreement should benefit us by moving away from selling individual solutions within highly commoditized markets that are experiencing pricing pressures.

New Offerings

During 2023 and going forward, we plan to continue to innovate, improve and build new applications into and with our platform, with the objective of developing integrated application solutions that are typically not offered by our competitors. As a company focused on technology offerings, we understand the importance of advancements and fully appreciate the risks and consequences of losing our market position if our product offerings become obsolete. 

Each year we bring to market certain platform upgrades, add-ons, and new offerings that we believe will complement our overall platform solutions. We believe our innovation and platform technology efficiencies continue to be a competitive advantage and focus for us.

We have a slate of product platform enhancements coming this fiscal year as we have had in the past, that will help our customers stay connected with their customers, shareholders and constituent base. Specifically, these advancements will be centered around our communications business, whereby we will be adding analytical components and databases to aid in the discovery of a company’s brand. Additionally, we have other strategic upgrades to our platform that we believe will both increase customer retention and annual revenue per customer.

Our acquisition of Newswire provides us the opportunity to offer MAP and our media database platform to existing ACCESSWIRE customers. MAP is a media and marketing communications utility that converts customers’ owned media into earned media opportunities to accelerate business growth. The MAP Market Builder provides integrated media and marketing communications programs aimed to increase site traffic, qualified leads and lowering cost of acquisition for new accounts. The media database platform offers customers access to over a million journalists, broadcasters, and other publishers to target and compose their customized campaign to disseminate to a specific audience. The database also allows customers access to recently published articles by the media contacts to find relevant points to include their messages.

Acquisition Strategy

We will continue to evaluate complimentary verticals and businesses that we can integrate into our communications platform. While we typically focus on accretive acquisition opportunities, we will also evaluate technology acquisitions that we believe would be strategic to our overall business. Specifically, we will look for communications products and businesses that have recurring revenues, customers and technologies that will further enhance our overall market position.
Sales and Marketing

During 2022, we continued to strengthen our brands in the market by working aggressively to expand our customer footprint and continue to cross sell to increase average revenue per customer. Since our platform, systems and operations are built to handle growth, we can leverage them to produce consistently high margins and increased cash flows without a proportional increase in our capital or operating expenses.

Our sales organization is responsible for generating new customer opportunities and expanding our current customers. We ended 2022 with a multi-tier organization of sales personnel, consisting of Business Development Managers and Customer Service Managers. We believe this approach is the most efficient and effective way to reach new customers and grow our current install base. The total compensation packages for these teams are heavily weighted with commission compensation to incent sales and retention. All members of the sales team have quotas. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 40 full-time equivalent sales and marketing personnel compared to 30 as of December 31, 2021. The increase is driven by additional sales and marketing personnel associated with Newswire.

Our marketing organization has been focused on both new customer acquisition as well as campaigns to educate current customers on the advantages of using our platform. Additionally, our marketing team has expanded their focus on investor conferences, strategic partnerships and private company marketing activities in order to continue to scale our business long term.

Cybersecurity

In all our offerings, quality, support, and scalability as well as the need to preserve the confidential content of our customers are of utmost importance and part of our core values. We continue to maintain agreements with security software and hardware providers and consulting firms to identify, address and create policies and plans which enable us to mitigate our cybersecurity and information vulnerabilities on both a short-term and long-term basis. We believe having a solid cyber and information security policy is not only necessary to maintain our current business model but also is important to attract new customers. During the latter half of 2021, we spent considerable amounts of time building processes, internal controls and systems requirements to adhere to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) criteria for a Service Organization Control 2 (“SOC 2”) report. As a result, we were issued our SOC 2 with a favorable opinion for the period ended November 30, 2022. We plan to continue to work closely with these firms, as well as our audit partner, to maintain our service commitments and system related to the elected trust services criteria.
Industry Overview

According to a 2022 Burton-Taylor Media Intelligence report, the global communications technology market is more than $5.5 billion in annual revenue. This total includes spending on social media solutions, media monitoring, press release targeting and distribution, and investor relations platforms globally. A key driver of growth in our industry is the introduction of new innovative technologies and solutions. We believe our technology and workflow automation solutions will help us gain market share within the industry.

Initially, the webcasting and virtual event side of the communications industry was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as demand significantly increased for virtual events due to cancelled live, in-person events, meetings and conferences. Toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, we began enhancing our products by adding virtual components, as well as focusing our selling efforts on our webcasting technologies. However, the heightened demand for these virtual events began to ease as restrictions began to be lifted in 2021 and returned to in-person events in 2022.

The communications industry also benefits from increased regulatory requirements and the need for platforms and systems to manage these new regulations. Additionally, the industry, along with cloud-based technologies, have matured considerably over the past several years, whereby corporate issuers and communication professionals are seeking platforms and systems to do some, if not all the work themselves. We believe we are well positioned in this new environment to benefit from subscriptions and further advancements of our platform.

The compliance industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of independent service companies that provide a range of financial reporting and document management services. There is also a wide range of printing and technology software providers. The demands for many of our services historically have been cyclical and reliant on capital market activity. Over the past few years, we have been offering subscriptions which combine both compliance software and service in one annual contract. We believe this offering affords us the ability to reduce our revenue seasonality and provide a new baseline of recurring annualized revenue.

Competition

Despite some significant consolidation in recent years, the communications and compliance industries remain both highly fragmented and extremely competitive. The success of our products and services are generally based on price, quality, and the ability to service customer demands. Management has been focused on offsetting the risks relating to competition as well as the seasonality by introducing our cloud-based subscription platform, with higher margins, clear competitive advantages, higher customer stickiness and scalability to withstand market and pricing pressures.

We also review our operations on a regular basis to balance growth with opportunities to maximize efficiencies and support our long-term strategic goals. We believe by blending our workflow technologies with our legacy service offerings we can offer a comprehensive set of products and solutions to each of our customers within one platform that most competitors cannot offer today.

We believe we are positioned to be the communications platform of choice as a cost-effective alternative to both small regional providers and global providers. We also believe we benefit from our location in Raleigh, North Carolina, as we can hire and retain sales, customer service or production personnel in the area at a reasonable cost. However, there are positions where we have strong competition in hiring, such as research and development and qualified sales individuals with communications industry experience.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of public and private companies, mutual funds, law firms, brokerage firms, investment banks, individuals, and other institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we worked with 8,218 customers, compared to 8,045 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This amount includes 1,196 customers from Newswire for the months of November and December. The decrease in customers on the ISDR side is primarily related to a reduction in private customers and customers from agencies we no longer partner with to reduce low margin business and have a direct relationship with our customers. We did not have any customers during the year ended December 31, 2022 that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue or more than 10% of our year end accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022.
Human Capital and Culture

As of December 31, 2022, we employed 137 employees and independent contractors, none of which are represented by a union. Our employees work in our corporate offices in North Carolina or their home offices throughout North America. The increase in headcount over the prior year us primarily related to the acquisition of Newswire.

We recognize and value our people as our most important asset in achieving our strategic goals and growing an industry leading communications and compliance company. We are continually working on a human resources strategy that helps drive the right culture, leadership, talent management, performance, reward and recognition, personal development, and ways of working to ensure we achieve our strategic goals while our people benefit from an exceptional experience. Our focus areas in creating a working environment that draws out the best in our employees and allows them to fulfil their potential and support our goals are as follows:


· | Attract, identify, develop and retain high-performing employees across all areas. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Develop and support the growth of management and leadership. 
· | Enable the development of a high-performance culture in which staff performance can be supported, rewarded, enhanced and managed effectively. 
· | Foster a values-based culture focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, well-being, and positive staff engagement. 
· | Develop a total reward approach which is valued by staff and facilitates company objectives. 
· | Provide excellent core human resources, professional development and health and safety services across all departments to enable the effective operation of the Company.


Our recruitment strategy is based on identifying top talent, predominantly via existing networks and referrals, and offering competitive compensation packages that combine salary, benefits, equity, and a bonus plan. We apply a wide range of retention initiatives that include rewarding high-performance and opening opportunities for progression and career development. Identification of high-performing talent is linked to succession planning and development of the future-workforce is embedded in employee professional development plans. 

We attempt to set clear standards with respect to generating an open and transparent working environment in which everyone has a voice. We believe this invokes effective personal development discussions and provides the opportunity to conduct performance reviews supported by transparent data and open conversation.

We are dedicated to embedding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) as an important part of developing our culture through delivery of innovative initiatives and internal workshops, ensuring that DEI policies touch on all aspects of the Company from recruitment practices to company behavior/operating frameworks. These policies will also be reviewed periodically as required and updated accordingly.  

We strive to deliver a total reward strategy which appropriately supports achievement of our goals and will help position us as an employer of choice which employees value and understand. This will undergo periodic review to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent in a financially sustainable way.

All our human resource initiatives are supported by key performance indicators to monitor their effectiveness and gain insight into gaps that can be addressed quickly and ensure our overall human resource strategy is adapted as required and maintained to a high degree.

Facilities

Our headquarters are located in Raleigh, North Carolina. In October 2019, we began a new lease for 9,766 square feet of office space, which expires December 31, 2027.

As part of our acquisition of VWP in 2019, we assumed a three-year lease in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, which expired on January 3, 2022 and we did not renew. Additionally, we had an office in Salt Lake City, Utah, which we vacated in 2022. We did not assume any leases associated with the Newswire acquisition. We continue to monitor the needs of our employees both in a remote and on-site basis and make necessary adjustments to our locations as needed.
Insurance

We maintain both a general business liability, cyber-security and an errors and omissions policies specific to our industry and operations. We believe that our insurance policies provide adequate coverage for all reasonable risks associated with operating our business. Additionally, we maintain a Directors and Officers insurance policy, which is standard for our industry and size. We also maintain key person life insurance on our C level executives, and one other key individual. 

We obtained a representation and warranty insurance policy in connection with our acquisition of Newswire relating to potential indemnification claims under the purchase agreement up to an aggregate amount of $12.9 million subject to a retention of $0.4 million.

Regulations

The securities and financial services industries generally are subject to regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Regulatory policies in the United States and the rest of the world are tasked with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial markets and with protecting the interests of both issuers and shareholders.

In the United States, corporate issuers are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws, which often require public disclosure and regulatory filings. At the federal level, the SEC regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, formally known as NASD, and NYSE market regulations, various stock exchanges, and other self-regulatory organizations (“SRO”).

We operate our filing agent business and transfer agent business under the supervision and regulations of the SEC. Our transfer agency business, Direct Transfer, LLC, is registered with the SEC and is subject to SEC regulations relating to, among other things, annual reporting, examination, internal controls, tax reporting and escheatment services. Our transfer agency is currently approved to handle the securities of NYSE, NASDAQ and OTC Markets.

Our objective is to assist corporate issuers with these regulations, communication and compliance of rules imposed by regulatory bodies. The majority of our business involves the distribution of content, either electronically or on paper, to governing bodies and shareholders alike. We are recognized under these regulations to disseminate, communicate and or solicit on behalf of our customers, the issuers.
