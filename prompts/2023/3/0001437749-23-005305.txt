General
 
For more than 40 years, NRC Health has led the charge to humanize healthcare and support organizations in their understanding of each unique individual. NRC Health’s commitment to Human Understanding® helps leading healthcare systems get to know each person they serve not as point-in-time insights, but as an ongoing relationship. Guided by its uniquely empathic heritage, NRC Health’s patient-focused approach, unmatched market research, and emphasis on consumer preferences are transforming the healthcare experience, creating strong outcomes for patients and entire healthcare systems.
 
Our end-to-end solutions enable our clients to understand what matters most to each person they serve – before, during, after, and beyond clinical encounters – to gain a longitudinal understanding of how life and health intersect, with the goal of developing lasting, trusting relationships. Our ability to measure what matters most and systematically capture, analyze, and deliver insights based on self-reported information from patients, families, and consumers is critical in today’s healthcare market. We believe access to and analysis of our extensive consumer-driven information is increasingly valuable as healthcare providers need to better understand and engage the people they serve to create long-term relationships and build loyalty.
 
Our expertise includes the efficient capture, transmittal, analysis, and interpretation of critical data elements from millions of healthcare consumers. Using our solutions, our partners gain insights into what people think and feel about their organizations in real-time, allowing them to build on their strengths and implement service recovery with greater speed and personalization. We also provide legacy experience-based solutions and shared intelligence from industry thought leaders and the nation’s largest member network focused on healthcare governance and strategy to member boards and executives.
 
Our portfolio of subscription-based solutions provides actionable information and analysis to healthcare organizations across a range of mission-critical, constituent-related elements, including patient experience, service recovery, care transitions, employee engagement, reputation management, and brand loyalty. We partner with clients across the continuum of healthcare services and believe this cross-continuum positioning is a unique and an increasingly important capability as evolving payment models drive healthcare providers and payers towards a more collaborative and integrated service model. 
 
We have a broad and diversified client base that is distributed primarily across the United States. Our ten largest clients collectively accounted for 15%, 14%, and 14% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 1%, 2% and 2% of our revenue was derived from foreign customers in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
 
We have achieved a market leadership position through our more than 40 years of industry innovation and experience, as well as our long-term, recurring revenue relationships (solutions that are used or required by a client each year) with many of the healthcare industry’s largest organizations. Since our founding in 1981, we have focused on meeting the evolving information needs of the healthcare industry through internal product development, as well as select acquisitions. We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska.
 
Human Understanding Solutions
 
NRC Health recognizes that behind every person is a story. We help our partners get to know each person they serve - their behaviors, preferences, wants, and needs—not as point-in-time insights, but as an ongoing relationship.
 
With the complexity and demands associated with healthcare delivery today, seeing the whole picture is now more important than ever. The end-to-end Human Understanding solutions are designed to help capture and act on what matters most to patients and their families.
 
The Human Understanding solutions deliver the capabilities needed to turn strategic aspiration into action in critical focus areas. Each set of capabilities unlocks Human Understanding at the right time and place to improve care, enhance performance, and catalyze growth.
 
Our digital solutions consist of three primary solution categories which can be implemented both collectively as an enterprise solution or individually to meet specific needs within the organization. The primary solution categories include Marketing, Reputation, and Experience.
 
  2 

  

Marketing Solutions – Our Marketing solutions are subscription-based services that allow for improved tracking of awareness, perception, and consistency of healthcare brands; real-time assessment of competitive differentiators; and enhanced segmentation tools to evaluate the needs, wants, and behaviors of communities through real-time competitive assessments and enhanced segmentation tools. Market Insights is the largest U.S. healthcare consumer database of its kind, measuring the opinions and behaviors of approximately 300,000 healthcare consumers across the contiguous United States annually. Market Insights is a syndicated survey that provides clients with an independent third-party source of information that is used to understand consumer perception and preferences and optimize marketing strategies. Our Marketing solutions provide clients with on-demand tools to measure brand value and build brand equity in their markets, evaluate and optimize advertising efficacy and consumer recall, and tailor research to obtain the real time voice of customer feedback to support branding and loyalty initiatives.
Experience Solutions – Our Experience solutions are provided on a subscription basis via a cross-continuum multi-mode digital platform that collects and measures data and then delivers business intelligence that our clients utilize to improve patient experience, engagement and loyalty. Patient experience data can also be collected on a periodic basis using Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (“CAHPS”) compliant mail and telephone survey methods for regulatory compliance purposes and to monitor and measure improvement in CAHPS survey scores. CAHPS survey data can be collected and measured as an integrated service within our digital platform or independently as a legacy service offering. Our Experience solutions provide healthcare systems with the ability to receive and act on customer and employee feedback across all care settings in real-time. Experience solutions include patient experience, workforce engagement, health risk assessments, care transition, and improvement tools. These solutions enable clients to comply with regulatory requirements and to improve their reimbursement under value-based purchasing models. More importantly, our Experience solutions provide quantitative and qualitative real-time feedback, improvement plans, and coaching insights.   By illuminating the complete care journey in real time, our clients can ensure each individual receives the care, respect, and experience they deserve. Developing a longitudinal profile of what healthcare customers want and need allows for organizational improvement and increased customer loyalty.
 
Our Experience solutions also include tools to drive effective communication between healthcare providers and patients in the critical 24-72 hours post discharge using an automated discharge call workflow supported by our digital platform. Through preference-based communications and real-time alerts, these solutions enable organizations to identify and manage high-risk patients to reduce readmissions, increase patient satisfaction and support safe care transitions. Tracking, trending and benchmarking tools isolate the key areas for process improvement allowing organizations to implement changes and reduce future readmissions.
 
Reputation Solutions – Our Reputation solutions allow healthcare organizations to share a picture of their organization and ensure that timely and relevant content informs better consumer decision-making. Our star ratings tools enable our partners to publish a five-star rating metric and verified patient feedback derived from actual patient survey data to complement their online physician information. Sharing this feedback not only results in better-informed consumer decision-making but also has the ability to drive new patient acquisition and grow online physician reputation. Our reputation monitoring tool alerts our partners to ratings and reviews on third-party websites and provides workflows for response and service recovery. These solutions raise physician awareness of survey results and provide access to improvement resources and educational development opportunities designed to improve the way care is delivered.
The Governance Institute
 
Our Governance solutions, branded as The Governance Institute (“TGI”), serves not-for-profit health system boards of directors, executives, and physician leadership. TGI’s subscription-based, value-driven membership services are provided through national conferences, publications, advisory services, and an online portal designed to improve the effectiveness of hospital and healthcare systems by continually strengthening their board governance, strategic planning, medical leadership, management performance and customer loyalty. TGI also conducts research studies and tracks industry trends showcasing emerging healthcare trends and best practice solutions of healthcare system boards across the country. TGI thought leadership helps our client board members and executives inform and guide their organization’s strategic priorities in alignment with the rapidly changing healthcare market.

Markets
 
Growth Strategy
 
We believe that the value proposition of our current solutions, combined with the favorable alignment of our solutions with emerging market demand, positions us to benefit from multiple growth opportunities. We believe that we can accelerate our growth through (1) increasing scope of services and sales of our existing solutions to our existing clients (or cross-selling), (2) winning additional new clients through market share growth in existing market segments, (3) developing and introducing new solutions to new and existing clients, and (4) pursuing acquisitions of, or investments in, firms providing products, solutions or technologies which complement ours.
 
Increasing contract value with existing clients. Our growth team actively identifies and pursues cross-sell opportunities for clients to add additional solutions in order to accelerate our growth. Organic contract value growth is also realized by the increased scope of solution adoption as the size of client organizations increase from market expansion and consolidation.
 
Adding new clients. We believe that there is an opportunity to add new clients across all solutions. Our sales organization is actively identifying and engaging new client prospects with a focus on demonstrating the economic value derived from adopting the portfolio of solutions in alignment with the prospect’s strategic objectives.
 
Adding new solutions. The need for effective solutions in the market segments that we serve is evolving to align with emerging healthcare consumerism trends. The evolving market creates an opportunity for us to introduce new solutions that leverage and extend our existing core competencies. We believe that there is an opportunity to drive sales growth with both existing and new clients, across all of the market segments that we serve, through the introduction of new solutions.
 
Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments. We have historically complemented our organic growth with strategic acquisitions, having completed eight such transactions over the past nineteen years. These transactions have added new capabilities and access to market segments that are adjacent and complementary to our existing solutions and market segments. We believe that additional strategic acquisition and/or investment opportunities will exist from time to time to complement our organic growth by further expanding our service capabilities, technology offerings and end markets.
 
We generate the majority of our revenue from the renewal of subscription-based client service agreements, supplemented by sales of additional solutions to existing clients and the addition of new clients. Our sales activities are carried out by our growth team staffed with professional, trained sales associates.
 
We engage in marketing activities that enhance our brand visibility in the marketplace, generate demand for our solutions and engage existing clients. Strategic campaigns and programs focus on (1) ensuring coverage of prospective clients via targeted advertising and account-based campaigns, (2) elevating client value evidence and success stories to an executive level profile, (3) engaging key stakeholders with content, programming and events and (4) amplifying thought leadership through public and media relations programs that include earning placement in national media and trade publications, securing podium presentations at key industry events and winning awards on behalf of us and our executives.
 
Competition
 
The healthcare information and market research services industry is highly competitive. We have traditionally competed with healthcare organizations’ internal marketing, market research, and/or quality improvement departments which create their own performance measurement tools, and with relatively small specialty research firms which provide survey-based healthcare market research and/or performance assessment. Our primary competitors among such specialty firms include Press Ganey, which we believe has significantly higher annual revenue than us, and several other organizations that we believe have less annual revenue than us. We also compete with market research firms and technology solutions which provide survey-based, general market research or voice of the customer feedback capabilities and firms that provide services or products that complement healthcare performance assessments such as healthcare software or information systems.
 
We believe the primary competitive factors within our market include quality of service, timeliness of delivery, unique service capabilities, credibility of provider, industry experience, and price. We believe that our industry leadership position, exclusive focus on the healthcare industry, cross-continuum presence, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and relationships with leading healthcare providers position us to compete in this market.
 
    4 

  

Although only a few of these competitors have offered specific services that compete directly with our solutions, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, information gathering, and marketing resources than us and could decide to increase their resource commitments to our market. There are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and we expect increased competition in our market which could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure, increased marketing expenditures, and market share losses, among other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.
 
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
 
A leading provider of patient experience solutions for healthcare providers and other healthcare organizations. Our history is based on capturing the voice of the consumer in healthcare markets. Our solutions build on the “Eight Dimensions of Patient-Centered Care,” a philosophy developed by noted patient advocate Harvey Picker, who believed patients’ experiences are integral to quality healthcare. This foundation has been enhanced through our digital platform offering that provides the delivery of data and insights on a real time basis to understand what matters most to each individual. Based on our more than 40 years of experience, we are able to deliver unique and relevant healthcare domain expertise to the clients we serve.
 
Established client base of leading healthcare organizations. Our client portfolio encompasses a majority of the leading healthcare systems across the United States. Over 270 of the top 400 healthcare systems based on net patient revenue are currently using one or more of our solutions. Our client base provides a unique network effect to share best practices among existing clients and to attract new clients. Our existing client base also provides a significant organic growth opportunity to upsell and cross sell additional solutions.
 
Highly scalable and visible revenue model. Our solutions are offered primarily through fixed price, subscription-based service agreements. The solutions we provide are also recurring in nature, which enables an ongoing relationship with our clients and favorable retention. This combination of subscription-based revenue, a base of ongoing client renewals and automated platforms creates a highly visible and scalable revenue model.
 
Comprehensive portfolio of solutions. Our portfolio of subscription-based solutions provides actionable information and analysis to healthcare organizations across a range of mission-critical, constituent-related elements, including patient experience, service recovery, care transitions, employee engagement, reputation management, and brand loyalty. Our end-to-end solutions enable our clients to understand what matters most to each person they serve – before, during, after, and beyond clinical encounters – to gain a longitudinal understanding of each individual. We partner with clients across the continuum of healthcare services and believe this cross-continuum positioning is a unique and an increasingly important capability as evolving payment models drive healthcare providers and payers towards a more collaborative and integrated service model.
 
Exclusive focus on healthcare. We focus exclusively on healthcare and serving the unique needs of healthcare organizations across the continuum, which we believe gives us a distinct competitive advantage compared to other survey and analytics software providers. Our value proposition incorporates the benefits to clients derived from our deep subject matter expertise that has been built from helping healthcare organizations over the past 40 years. Our platform includes features and capabilities built specifically for healthcare providers, including a library of performance improvement content which can be tailored to the provider based on their specific customer feedback profile.
 
Experienced senior management team led by our founder. Our senior management team has extensive industry and leadership experience. Michael D. Hays, our Chief Executive Officer and President, founded NRC Health in 1981. Prior to launching the Company, Mr. Hays served as Vice President and as a Director of SRI Research Center, Inc. (now known as the Gallup Organization). Our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Karas, CPA, has extensive financial experience having served as CFO at two previous companies, along with healthcare experience at Rehab Designs of America, Inc. and NovaCare, Inc. Jona Raasch has served as our Chief Operating Officer for most of the last 31 years and as Chief Executive Officer of the Governance Institute for more than 15 years.  Helen Hrdy was appointed as our Chief Growth Officer in 2020.  Prior to this position Ms. Hrdy served as our Senior Vice President, Customer Success, for eight years.

Resources
 
Our success depends in part upon our data collection processes, research methods, data analysis techniques and internal systems, and procedures that we have developed specifically to serve clients in the healthcare industry. We have no patents for most of our intellectual property. Consequently, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and associate nondisclosure agreements to protect our systems, survey instruments and procedures. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior systems or procedures. We believe that our systems and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future or that any such claims will not result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims or whether we are ultimately successful in defending against such claims.
Government Regulation
 
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), health expenditures in the United States were approximately $4.3 trillion in 2021, or $12,914 per person. In total, health spending accounted for 18.3% of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 2021. Addressing this growing expenditure burden continues to be a major policy priority at both federal and state levels. In addition, increased co-pays and deductibles in healthcare plans have focused even more consumer attention on health spending and affordability. In the public sector, Medicare provides health coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, while Medicaid provides coverage for low-income families and other individuals in need. Both programs are administered by the CMS. With the aging of the U.S. population, Medicare enrollment has increased significantly.  In addition, longer life spans and greater prevalence of chronic illnesses among both the Medicare and Medicaid populations have placed tremendous demands on the health care system.
 
An increasing percentage of Medicare reimbursement and reimbursement from commercial payers has been determined under value payment models, based on factors such as patient readmission rates and provider adherence to certain quality-related protocols. At the same time, many hospitals and other providers are creating new models of care delivery to improve patient experience, reduce cost and provide better clinical outcomes. These new models are based on sharing financial risk and managing the health and behaviors of large populations of patients and consumers. This transformation towards value-based payment models and increased engagement of healthcare consumers is resulting in a greater need for existing healthcare providers to deliver more customer-centric healthcare. At the same time, organizations that have successfully developed effective customer service models and brand loyalty in other industry verticals are entering the healthcare services market.
 
We believe that our current portfolio of solutions is uniquely aligned to address these healthcare market trends and related business opportunity. We provide tools and solutions to capture, interpret and improve the CAHPS data required by CMS as well as real time feedback that enables clients to better understand what matters most to people at key moments in their relationship with a health organization. Our solutions enable our clients to both satisfy patient survey compliance requirements and design experiences to build loyalty and improve the wellbeing of the people and communities they care for.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 491 associates. None of our associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit. The majority of our associates work remotely. We attract a passionate team of associates who care deeply about making a difference in advancing “Human Understanding” in healthcare. We consider our relationships with our associates to be good.
 
We are committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, genetic information, ancestry, veteran status, or disability. We are an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.
