ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General

Atrion Corporation and its subsidiaries (”we,” “our,” “us,” “Atrion,” or the “Company”) develop and manufacture products, primarily for medical applications. Our medical products are used in a number of fields including fluid delivery, cardiovascular, and ophthalmic applications.

Our fluid delivery products accounted for 46 percent of net revenues for 2022, 47 percent for 2021, and 51 percent for 2020. We have developed a wide variety of proprietary valves designed to precisely fill, hold, and release controlled amounts of fluids or gasses on demand for use in various intubation, intravenous, catheter, and other applications in fields such as anesthesia and oncology. We manufacture products that deliver fluids as well as promote infection control in hospital and home healthcare environments.

Our cardiovascular products accounted for 37 percent of net revenues for 2022, 34 percent for 2021, and 33 percent for 2020. At the core of our cardiovascular products is our Myocardial Protection System, a proprietary technology that is the only open-heart surgery system that delivers to the heart essential fluids and medications, mixes critical drugs, and controls temperature, pressure, and other important variables. This system indicates improved outcomes offering an integrated, flexible set of choices during surgery without diluting the blood. In late 2020, we launched a latest generation of our system, the MPS®3, which features even greater levels of performance, safety, and flexibility. We also develop and manufacture other cardiovascular products such as cardiac surgery vacuum relief valves; silicone vessel loops for retracting and occluding vessels in minimally invasive surgical procedures; inflation devices for balloon catheter dilation, stent deployment, and fluid dispensing; as well as products used in heart bypass surgery to make a precision opening in the heart for attachment of the bypass vessels.

Our ophthalmic products accounted for 3 percent of net revenues for 2022, 4 percent for 2021, and 3 percent for 2020. We are a leading manufacturer of specialized medical devices that disinfect contact lenses. We also manufacture a proprietary line of balloon catheters used in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children and adults.

Our other medical and non-medical products accounted for 14 percent of net revenues for 2022, 15 percent for 2021, and 13 percent for 2020. Within this area, we manufacture and sell a line of products designed for safe needle and scalpel blade containment. We are also the leading manufacturer of inflation systems and valves used in marine and aviation safety products. We manufacture components used in inflatable survival products and structures. We also produce one-way and two-way pressure relief valves that protect sensitive electronics and other products during transport in medical and non-medical applications.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to provide hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers with the tools they need to improve the lives of the patients they serve. To do so, we provide a broad selection of products in our areas of expertise in the medical device industry. We focus on meeting customer needs with existing products and expanding current product lines. We seek to develop new products for our current customers and to develop new customers in niche markets. We reach a broad base of customers through our direct sales force, independent sales representatives, and distributors in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries. We have diverse product lines serving primarily the fluid delivery, cardiovascular, and ophthalmic markets, and this diversity has served us well as we encounter changing market conditions. Our manufacturing operations are conducted at three geographically separate facilities, thereby lessening the risk that a singular event in any one location could cripple our manufacturing operations. Furthermore, all of our manufacturing activities are conducted in the United States, thus lessening the risk that offshore events could interfere with our manufacturing operations. We make significant investments in research and development, or R&D, at all three of our facilities in order to maintain and enhance our position in the medical device industry.

We have created and maintained a culture of controlling costs, and we regularly invest in modern manufacturing technologies. We have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations, thus enabling us to expand our operations. Over the past 22 years, we have grown our existing businesses and, in doing so, we have succeeded in increasing revenues from $51.4 million in 2000 to $183.5 million in 2022 and increasing net income from $2.8 million in 2000 to $35.0 million in 2022. We plan to continue focusing on internal growth and are significantly expanding one of our manufacturing facilities to support that growth. During this 22-year period, we have explored various acquisition opportunities but have elected not to proceed with them, focusing instead on internal growth. However, we believe that we can continue growing internally and, at the same time, make acquisitions that will enhance our growth, and we are continuing to seek such opportunities.

Marketing 

We market components to other equipment manufacturers for incorporation in their products and sell finished devices to physicians, hospitals, clinics, and other treatment centers. We sell our products through a sales force which consists of direct sales personnel, independent sales representatives, and distributors. Our sales managers also work closely with major customers in designing and developing products to meet customer requirements.

We offer customer service, training and education, and technical support such as field service, spare parts, maintenance, and repair for certain of our products. We periodically advertise our products in trade journals, routinely attend and participate in industry trade shows throughout the United States and internationally, and sponsor scientific symposia as a means of disseminating product information. We also have supportive literature on the benefits of our products.

Manufacturing

Our medical and non-medical products are manufactured at facilities in Florida, Alabama, and Texas. The facilities in Alabama and Florida both utilize plastic injection molding and specialized assembly as their primary manufacturing processes. Our other manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of standard and custom component parts, including the assembly of electronic components, and the testing of completed products.

Our Quality Management System complies with US FDA Quality System Regulations, Medical Device Single Audit Program requirements, and the European Medical Device Directives, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain design testing, quality control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during and after the manufacturing process. Our devices comply with all regulations applicable to the countries where they are registered. We devote significant attention to quality assurance and regulatory compliance. Our quality assurance measures begin with the suppliers which participate in our supplier quality assurance program. These measures continue at the manufacturing level where many components are assembled in a clean room environment designed and maintained to reduce product exposure to particulate matter. Products are tested throughout the manufacturing process for adherence to specifications. Most finished products are then shipped to outside processors for sterilization by radiation or ethylene oxide gas. After sterilization, the products are quarantined and tested before they are shipped to customers.

Our medical device operations are EN ISO13485:2016 certified and are subject to FDA jurisdiction.

Research and Development

A well-targeted R&D program is an essential part of our activities, and we are currently engaged in a number of R&D projects. The objective of this program is to develop new products in our current product lines, improve current products, and develop new product lines. The Company expects to continue additional R&D in 2023 in all aspects of this program.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials that we use in our products are resins. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in part, on the availability and pricing of these resins. The resins we use are derived from petroleum and natural gas, and the prices fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in petroleum and natural gas prices, demand, and the capacity of the companies that produce these resins to meet market needs. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the availability and pricing of these resins.

We contract with various suppliers to provide the component parts necessary to assemble our products. Substantially all of these components are available from a number of different suppliers, although certain components are purchased from single sources that manufacture these components using our tooling. We believe that we have satisfactory backup plans for single-sourced components, although a sudden disruption in supply from one or more of these suppliers could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished products on time. We own the molds used for production of substantially all our components. Consequently, in the event of supply disruption, we believe we would be able to fabricate our own components or contract with another supplier, albeit after a possible delay in the production process.

Intellectual Property

We have developed, and our business depends in part on, significant know-how and proprietary technology. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, trademarks, patents, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other contracts. We own 481 patents and patent applications pending on products that are currently being sold by us or which we intend to sell in the future, 110 of which relate to fluid delivery products, 114 of which relate to cardiovascular products, 59 of which relate to ophthalmic products, and 198 of which relate to other products. We pay royalties to an outside party under a license agreement for one patent. Our patents expire at various times over the next 18 years. In assessing the importance of patents to our business and the impact of the expirations of our patents, we believe it is appropriate to take into account a number of factors, including the following: We have contractual commitments for certain products that extend beyond the expiration dates of our patents. Additionally, many of our products are components in other medical devices, and the cost of those components is generally very small compared to the cost of those medical devices. As a result, substituting alternative components would likely result in the manufacturers of those medical devices and their customers experiencing an elaborate technical and regulatory process that could add significant costs and delays and may not be cost effective, thus making it difficult for our potential competitors to replace our components in those medical devices. We manufacture our own products, and that experience has been and is expected to continue to be, beneficial to us beyond the expiration of our patents. During the life of a patent, we frequently invest in automation to increase quality and reduce cost, and we allocate resources to improving and developing enhancements to our products. Our experience has been that these steps increase the likelihood that we will be able to compete effectively if others try to duplicate our products after our patents expire. We have often been able to sell our products for many years beyond their patent expirations and expect that to continue in the future. However, we recognize that our future growth depends, in part, on our success in continuing to expand our patent portfolio as older patents expire. Much of our R&D effort is aimed at developing new products that will eventually take the place of our current products. We also have a number of trademark registrations that are generally for fixed but renewable terms. For the above reasons, as well as others, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset, or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.

We have developed technical knowledge which, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. We have entered into agreements with key employees prohibiting them from disclosing any of our trade secrets or other confidential information. In addition, generally these agreements also provide that inventions or discoveries relating to our business by these individuals will be assigned to us and become our sole property.

The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, and companies in this industry sometimes use intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is often complex and expensive, and the outcome of this litigation is generally difficult to predict.

Competition

Depending on the product and the nature of the project, we compete on the basis of our ability to provide engineering and design expertise, quality, service, product, and price. As such, successful competitors must have technical strength, responsiveness, and scale. We believe that our expertise and reputation for quality medical products have allowed us to compete favorably with respect to each such factor and to maintain long-term relationships with our customers.

In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources, and larger marketing and R&D staffs and facilities than ours. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques, product design or functions, or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

For some customers or prospective customers, we design products for a customer or potential customer prior to entering into long-term development and manufacturing agreements with those customers or prospective customers. Because these products are somewhat limited in number and normally are only a component of the ultimate product sold by our customers, we are dependent on our ability to meet the quality requirements of our customers and must continually be attentive to the need to manufacture such products at competitive prices and in compliance with strict manufacturing standards. Additionally, we are dependent on our customers’ success in the marketing of the ultimate products sold. We also compete in the market for inflation devices used in marine and aviation equipment.

Government Regulation

Medical Device Regulation in the United States

In the United States, medical devices are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution, and import and export of medical devices. All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. Our medical device subsidiaries and certain of our customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and our medical device manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA.

6


The FDA has traditionally pursued a rigorous enforcement program to ensure that regulated entities comply with the FDCA. A company not in compliance may face a variety of regulatory actions, including warning letters, product detentions, device alerts, mandatory recalls or field corrections, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, injunctive actions or civil penalties, and criminal prosecutions of the company or responsible employees, officers, and directors.

The FDA promulgates rules, which are available to the public, for the approval of medical devices. The process of obtaining FDA approval for new devices can take several months to several years depending on the type of application required for a particular device. Furthermore, the process of obtaining FDA approval can be expensive and uncertain. Even if granted, FDA approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. FDA enforcement policy strictly regulates the promotion of approved medical devices. Product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing. In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations requiring that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations requiring that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that scientific data substantiates the claims, and that our advertising is not false or misleading. We are permitted to promote and advertise our products solely for uses within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances and cannot make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for off-label uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on off-label promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the United States government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs. Many jurisdictions outside the United States have similar regulations.

Certain of our aviation and marine safety products are subject to regulation by the United States Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration and similar organizations in foreign countries which regulate the safety of marine and aviation equipment.

Medical Device Regulation Outside the United States

In order for our devices to be marketed in countries outside the United States, regulatory approvals must be obtained, and extensive product and quality system regulations must be complied with, in those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary significantly from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than similar processes in the United States. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we would like for our products to be sold could prevent our products from being marketed in those countries. The regulatory regime in the European Union requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose. Although some of the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated were substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive in 1993, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions. The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark. Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.

7


In May 2017, the European Union implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, which became fully effective on May 26, 2021 and replaced the European Union Medical Devices Directive. The MDR brought significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance. Compliance with the MDR requires re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards and has resulted, and will continue to result, in substantial additional expense.

In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards and specifications, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, and quality system requirements.

Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs. In many countries, our products may have to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Similar Anti-Corruption Laws

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, broadly prohibit businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.

We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Compliance with the FCPA and these other laws may be expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, anti-corruption laws present particular challenges in the medical device industry because in many countries hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. There is no assurance that our policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors in violation of those laws. Noncompliance with the FCPA or any other anti-corruption law could result in fines, penalties, or other adverse consequences and negatively affect our reputation.

Healthcare and Environmental Regulations

In the United States, healthcare providers, including hospitals and physicians, that purchase medical products for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance plans, to reimburse all or a part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed using these products.

Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. Market acceptance of our products in international markets depends, in part, on the availability and level of reimbursement.

Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals is generally based on a fixed amount for a patient based upon that patient’s specific diagnosis. Because of this fixed reimbursement method, hospitals may seek to reduce the costs they incur in treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Frequently, reimbursement is reduced to reflect the availability of a new procedure or technique, and as a result hospitals are generally willing to implement new cost saving technologies before these downward adjustments take effect. Likewise, because the rate of reimbursement for physicians who perform certain procedures has been and may in the future be reduced, physicians may seek greater cost efficiency in treatment to minimize any negative impact of reduced reimbursement. Third-party payors may challenge the prices charged for medical products and services and may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, was experimental, or was used for an unapproved application.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively known as the “Affordable Care Act”) were enacted. The Affordable Care Act made changes that have had a significant impact on healthcare providers, medical device and pharmaceutical companies, and insurers. The Affordable Care Act also established a payment transparency program, sometimes referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that requires medical device and drug manufacturers, including the Company, to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain other providers. The program is intended to provide patients with enhanced transparency as to the financial relationships that physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain other providers have with medical device and drug manufacturers. There have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions, of the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict with certainty what affect further changes to the Affordable Care Act would have on our business. Various legislation has been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including certain reductions in payments to Medicare providers. Future legislation and regulations may impact the health insurance marketplaces, essential health benefits requirements, reimbursement rates, and Medicaid marketplace waivers for state flexibilities. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, we anticipate that state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess healthcare reform, including alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. We cannot predict with certainty what impact the adoption or modification of any such reform measures or market forces may have on our business.

We are, directly or indirectly, subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as “safe harbors,” setting forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.

The Federal False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the United States government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, on behalf of the government, has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of medical device and drug manufacturers that included the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts, and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward.

We are also subject to various local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, hazardous substances, and health and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, matters such as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and, if any, the associated cleanup of properties affected by discharges, releases, or exposure to pollutants, air emissions, wastewater, and occupational and human health and safety. We believe we have been, and we are, in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations laws and regulations.

Product Liability and Insurance

The design, manufacture, and marketing of products of the types we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. A problem with one of our products could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert, or advisory notice relating to, the product. We have product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate.
Clinical Advisors

Several physicians and other healthcare professionals serve as our clinical advisors. These clinical advisors have assisted in the identification of the market need for some of our products. Members of our management and scientific and technical staff from time to time consult with these clinical advisors to better understand the technical and clinical requirements of current and future products. We anticipate that these clinical advisors will continue to play a role in our development activities.

Certain of the clinical advisors are employed by academic institutions and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to advise us. The clinical advisors may also serve as consultants to other medical device companies. Our clinical advisors are not expected to devote more than a small portion of their time in providing services to us.

Human Capital

Our Employees

As of December 31, 2022, we had 722 employees, all of whom were employed in the United States. Our highly qualified and experienced team, including employees responsible for our sales, marketing, manufacturing, regulatory, finance, and other important functions is critical to our success. During 2022, the number of employees increased by approximately 55. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business needs. As we grow our business over the next several years, we expect to add additional employees. We continually evaluate our business needs and opportunities and balance in house expertise and capacity with external expertise and capacity. Currently, we manufacture all of our products.

10

Our Culture

The success of our human capital management is evidenced by our typically low employee turnover, which is regularly reviewed by our senior management as part of its oversight of our human capital strategy. We have a strong commitment to our communities and are proud to offer jobs with excellent benefits to people often overlooked by too many businesses. We pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive, and positive culture based on our shared mission and values.
Employee Engagement and Benefits.
We believe that our continued success largely depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, certain opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that foster continued learning and growth, and an employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning, and paid time off. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
Diversity and Inclusion.
The tenets of diversity and inclusion have long been baked into the DNA of our Company. We have always operated our business in the United States, with a highly diverse workforce. We laud the popular focus on diversity in the boardroom—our Board had its first female director 21 years ago, and today, one of our four independent directors is a person of color. We believe that the focus on diversity and inclusion should be present at all levels of every company. Companies that do not offer opportunities to those who are struggling are failing in this mission. Over half of our employees have at most a high school degree. We proudly employ individuals who have come from difficult circumstances that all too often have the effect of disqualifying them from being hired at many companies, and we believe that businesses that ignore them often are losing out on exceptional talent. Additionally, we do not have a mandatory retirement age, and many of our employees have tenures with us ranging from 10 to 40 years. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings us.
