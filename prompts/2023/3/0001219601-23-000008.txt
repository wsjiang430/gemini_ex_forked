ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Crown Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or the "Registrant") (where the context requires, the "Company" shall include reference to the Company and its consolidated subsidiary companies) is a Pennsylvania corporation.
The Company, through its subsidiaries, is a leading global supplier of rigid packaging products to consumer marketing companies, as well as transit and protective packaging products, equipment and services to a broad range of end markets. The Company's consumer packaging solutions primarily support the beverage and food industries, along with the personal care and household industries, through the development and sale of aluminum and steel cans. The Company's transit and protective packaging products include steel and plastic consumables and equipment, paper-based protective packaging, and plastic film consumables and equipment, which are sold into the metals, food and beverage, construction, agricultural, corrugated and general industries.
At December 31, 2022, the Company operated 199 plants along with sales and service facilities throughout 40 countries and had approximately 26,000 employees. In 2022, consolidated net sales for the Company were $12.9 billion with 63% derived from operations outside the United States ("U.S.") 
The Company's strategy is to deploy capital into its global beverage can operations to expand production capacity to support growing customer demand in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink categories. Beverage cans are the world’s most sustainable and recycled beverage packaging and continue to gain market share in new beverage product launches. The Company continues to drive brand differentiation by increasing its ability to offer multiple specialty can sizes. Size variations include slim and sleek cans, as well as larger sizes to help customers differentiate their products. It also continues to deliver new printing and decorating capabilities, as well as value-add services that aid customers throughout the entire production cycle, from consultation and development to line implementation and quality assurance
The Company is guided by commitments to its stakeholders and its own goals to foster a resilient business with longevity, which requires an emphasis on both financial performance and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") performance. The Company’s Twentyby30 program, which is a comprehensive sustainability strategy that outlines 20 measurable goals to be achieved by 2030, has accelerated critical initiatives and progress around carbon footprint management and social impact. 
The Company continues to leverage the inherent ecofriendly benefits of its primary product, metal packaging, to advance toward its targets. Aluminum cans, which are infinitely recyclable and remain the world’s most recycled beverage packaging, exemplify sustainability and are a strong contributor to the circular economy. The Company is working in conjunction with industry partners to drive higher recycling rates and increase recycled content to ensure infinitely recycled aluminum cans are available for generations of future use. 
Approximately 66% of the Company's consolidated net sales were derived from the Company's global beverage can operations. The Company’s beverage can business is built around local, regional and global markets, which has served to develop the Company’s understanding of global customer and consumer expectations. The Company expects to continue to responsibly add beverage can capacity to meet customer needs, as necessary.

Additional financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments is set forth within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report and under Note Y to the consolidated financial statements.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Global marketers qualify suppliers on the basis of their ability to provide global service, innovative designs and technologies in a cost-effective manner. With its global reach, the Company primarily markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staff. In some instances, contracts with customers are centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by the Company’s local facilities. The Company’s facilities are generally located in proximity to their respective major customers. The Company works closely with customers in order to develop new business and to extend the duration of existing contracts.
Many customers provide the Company with quarterly or annual estimates of product requirements along with related quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. Such estimates assist the Company in managing production and controlling use of working capital. The Company schedules its production to meet customer requirements. Because the production time for the Company’s rigid packaging products is short, any backlog of customer orders in relation to overall sales is not significant. The standard backlog in Transit Packaging’s automation, equipment and tools business, is typically not significant, however, supply chain constraints may increase the backlog from time to time. 
COMPETITION
Most of the Company’s packaging products for consumer goods are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on price, quality, service and performance. The Company competes with other packaging manufacturers as well as with fillers, food processors and packers, some of whom manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. The Company’s 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

competitors include, but are not limited to, Ardagh Metal Packaging, Ball Corporation, Mauser Packaging Solutions, Can-Pack S.A., Metal Container Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco, and Trivium Packaging.
Transit Packaging also faces substantial competition from many regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products. Transit Packaging differentiates itself from the competition by leveraging its global scale, broad product portfolio and established brand reputation. Transit Packaging products compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including other products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal.
CUSTOMERS
The Company’s largest beverage can customers consist of many of the leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products in the world, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Keurig Dr Pepper, Molson Coors, Pepsi-Cola and Refresco, among others. Consolidation trends among beverage marketers have led to a concentrated customer base. The Company’s top ten global customers represented in the aggregate approximately 49% of its 2022 consolidated net sales. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, two customers each accounted for 12% and 11%, of the Company's consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020 the same two customers accounted for 11% and 10%, of the Company's consolidated net sales. These customers are global beverage companies served by the Company's beverage operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia. 
Each reportable segment, with the exception of Transit Packaging, has major customers and the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on an individual segment or the Company as a whole. In addition to sales to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, the Company also supplies independent licensees of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. 
MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
The Company uses various raw materials, primarily aluminum and steel, in its manufacturing operations. Transit Packaging also uses materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. In general, these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.
The Company has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations.
In 2022, consumption of aluminum and steel represented 44% and 9%, respectively, of consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of these raw materials to the overall cost of products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations, changes in ownership, government regulations, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and other industries, among other risk factors, could cause uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Company might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the prices of aluminum and steel can be subject to significant volatility. The Company’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs and steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices or set repricing dates. 
The Company generally attempts to mitigate its aluminum and steel price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully mitigate that risk. The Company also uses commodity and foreign currency forwards in an attempt to manage its exposure to aluminum price volatility.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of aluminum and steel price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Company’s exposure to price volatility. In addition, if the Company were unable to purchase aluminum and steel for a significant period of time, its operations would be disrupted, and if the Company were unable to fully recover the higher cost of aluminum and steel, its financial results may be adversely affected. 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

As a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company’s business may increase as well, including utility and freight-related costs. The Company attempts to increase prices on its products accordingly in order to recover these costs. Certain of the Company's sales contracts contain non-metal pass-through provisions that include annual selling price adjustments based on a producer price index. In certain years the referenced index may be negative, requiring the Company to reduce its selling price while its actual costs may have increased.
In response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on improving raw material cost management. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or impossible to obtain on acceptable terms due to external factors, which could increase the Company’s costs or interrupt its business.
In addition to mitigating risks around pricing, the Company maintains its commitment to upholding and evolving standards for ethics and compliance as it sources materials. Regular engagement with suppliers is ongoing to manage materials and the impact on environments and communities. The Company strives to ensure all partners meet standards for responsible supply and adhere to the formal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Through the Twentyby30 program, the Company has committed to sourcing standards that by 2030 require 100% of core raw materials and service suppliers, by spend, to be assessed and comply with Crown Responsible and Ethical Sourcing policies and requirements. 
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability remains a core focus of the Company’s business strategy and commitments, as the Company recognizes its critical role in corporate social responsibility and the impact of sustainability performance on economic opportunity and stakeholder relationships, including customers and employees. As a major manufacturer with operations worldwide, the Company can significantly impact industry progress by supporting important environmental and social initiatives and adopting practices that create change both within the organization and within partner relationships.
In 2020, Crown established its comprehensive Twentyby30 program, setting 20 measurable goals to be reached by 2030 or sooner. These objectives encompass all aspects of sustainability and reflect areas considered material to the Company’s business as well as areas where it can create notable impact. Structured within five core program pillars of Climate Action, Resource Efficiency, Optimum Circularity, Working Together and Never Compromise, these initiatives include efforts such as making operational improvements in energy, water and waste and elevating our focus on material use efficiency, recycling, responsible and ethical sourcing and food contact and safety. 
The Company maintains a Corporate Environmental Sustainability Policy; a Human Rights Policy; a Responsible and Ethical Sourcing Policy; a Conflict Minerals Policy; and an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy. These policies serve as guidelines for all employees to adhere to as the Company works to advance its sustainability strategy.
Across Twentyby30 program pillars, the Company works toward continuous improvement in product design and manufacturing practices to provide the best outcome for the environment, communities, employees and consumers, both now and in the future. 
Aluminum and steel contribute to these improvements as, by nature, they are infinitely recyclable without loss of properties, meaning they can be repeatedly reused to form new consumer packaging with no degradation in performance, quality or safety. Recycling these metals offers significant savings in energy and water consumption, as well as carbon dioxide emissions. As such, the Company is collaborating with industry partners to improve recycling rates and recycled content rates. In addition, the Company is making strides in its energy and water usage on a global level, working to implement more renewable energy sources, minimize wastewater and execute water replenishment programs. 
A few key, recent efforts the Company has made to be a more proactive sustainability leader include:
•In 2022, the Company co-hosted the beverage can industry’s first Global Aluminum Can Sustainability Summit, bringing together over 100 global attendees from various parts of the aluminum supply chain and facilitating important discussions aimed at driving actionable progress toward the industry’s sustainability goals.
•The Company committed to The Climate Pledge, targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, a full 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement goals. 
•In 2022, Crown signed on to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, a voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles and take steps to support UN goals. 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

Socially, the Company is continuing to elevate its commitments to community engagement through more volunteer opportunities and by establishing a charitable giving program, which donates to various non-profit organizations across the regions in which it operates. Within its own workforce, the Company is prioritizing employee welfare and striving to more regularly engage its professionals to foster a more connected global team dedicated to individual and collective improvement as an organization. 
As a result of its collective efforts, the Company has recently received the following recognition:
•In 2022, ESG ratings provider Sustainalytics ranked the Company as a Low ESG Risk Rating for managing ESG risk within the metal and glass packaging sub-industry. 
•The Company was named to the America's Most Responsible Companies 2023 list by Newsweek. 
•The Company was ranked in the top 100 companies included in Forbes’ 2021 inaugural “World’s Top Female-Friendly Companies” list.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company’s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, disposal of waste, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere and the protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental requirements on the packaging industry and may require additional capital investment. Anticipated future restrictions in some jurisdictions on the use of certain coatings may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. There can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Discussion of the Company’s environmental matters is contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Environmental Matters,” and under Note P to the consolidated financial statements.

At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 26,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 6,000 employed by the Americas Beverage segment, 3,500 employed by the European Beverage segment, 5,000 employed by the Asia Pacific segment, 8,000 employed by the Transit Packaging segment and 3,500 employed by Other. 
A significant portion of the Company’s workforce is unionized. Collective bargaining agreements with varying terms and expiration dates cover approximately 11,400 employees. The Company did not experience any significant union-initiated work stoppages during the 2022 fiscal year and believes that its employee relations remain good. The Company does not expect that renegotiation of any collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2023 will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
The Company believes that its employees are key to achieving the Company’s business goals and growth strategy. Attracting, developing and retaining the most skilled and engaged people globally is crucial to all aspects of the Company’s activities.

The portfolio broadly covers about 340 customized technologies and spans diverse business platforms, as well as the different countries in which it operates. 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

The Company spent $34 million in 2022, $47 million in 2021, and $48 million in 2020 in its RD&E activities. Certain of these activities are expected to improve and expand the Company's product lines in the future. These expenditures include projects to improve manufacturing efficiencies, reduce unit costs, and develop new and improved value-added packaging systems. 
WORKING CAPITAL
The Company generally uses cash during the first nine months of the year to finance seasonal working capital needs. Beverage products are generally consumed in greater amounts during the warmer months and the food packaging business is somewhat seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The Company’s working capital requirements are funded by cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization and factoring programs.
