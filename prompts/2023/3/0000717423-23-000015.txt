Summary
Murphy Oil Corporation is a global oil and natural gas exploration and production company, with both onshore and offshore operations and properties. As used in this report, the terms Murphy, Murphy Oil, we, our, its and Company may refer to Murphy Oil Corporation or any one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Company was originally incorporated in Louisiana in 1950 as Murphy Corporation. It was reincorporated in Delaware in 1964, at which time it adopted the name Murphy Oil Corporation and was reorganized in 1983 to operate primarily as a holding company of its various businesses. In 2013, the U.S. downstream business was separated from Murphy Oil Corporation’s oil and natural gas exploration and production business. For reporting purposes, Murphy’s exploration and production activities are subdivided into three geographic segments, including the United States, Canada and all other countries. Additionally, the Corporate segment includes interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange effects, corporate risk management activities and administrative costs not allocated to the exploration and production segments. The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Houston, Texas following relocation from El Dorado, Arkansas in 2020. 
As part of the Company’s underlying operations, the Company is continually monitoring its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and impact on the environment as well as other social and environmental aspects of its business. See Sustainability on page 10.
In addition to the following information about each business activity, data about Murphy’s operations, properties and business segments, including revenues by class of products and financial information by geographic area, are provided on pages 32 through 47, 80 through 81, 104 through 106, 110 through 125 and 127 of this Form 10-K report.

Murphy Oil’s 2022 total proved reserves and proved undeveloped reserves are reconciled from 2021 as presented in the table below:

(Millions of oil equivalent barrels) | TotalProved Reserves | Total ProvedUndevelopedReserves
Beginning of year | 716.9 | | 297.7

End of year | 715.4 | | 279.4 

  For purposes of these computations, natural gas sales volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six MCF of natural gas to one barrel of oil.
  Includes 18.2 MMBOE and 3.2 MMBOE for total proved and proved undeveloped reserves, respectively, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.
During 2022, Murphy’s total proved reserves decreased by 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). The decrease in reserves principally relates to production of 63.9 MMBOE in 2022 and negative price revisions in Tupper Montney from higher commodity prices resulting in increased royalty rates and accelerated royalty incentive payouts. These revisions were offset by extensions of 58.5 MMBOE in onshore Canada, 15.8 MMBOE in offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada, and 5.8 MMBOE in the Eagle Ford Shale; improved recovery in the Gulf of Mexico; as well as acquisitions of increased working interest in two producing fields in the Gulf of Mexico and offsetting dispositions in the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford Shale. 
Murphy’s total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022 decreased 18.3 MMBOE from a year earlier. The proved undeveloped reserves reported in the table as extensions and discoveries during 2022 were predominantly attributable to four areas: the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, onshore Canada areas of Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay, and offshore Canada. Each of these areas had active development work ongoing during the year. The majority of proved undeveloped reserves associated with revisions of previous estimates was the result of negative price revisions in Tupper Montney from higher commodity prices resulting in increased royalty rates and accelerated royalty incentive payouts. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves migration to the proved developed category are attributable to drilling in the Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eagle Ford Shale. Other proved undeveloped increases resulted from improved recovery as well as an acquisition of increased working interest in two producing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The Company spent approximately $770 million in 2022 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. In the next three years, the Company expects to spend a range of approximately $350 million to $650 million per year to move current undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The anticipated level of spending in 2023 primarily includes drilling and development in the Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney areas.
At December 31, 2022, proved reserves are included for several development projects, including oil developments at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and Kaybob Duvernay in onshore Canada; as well as natural gas developments at Tupper Montney in onshore Canada. Total proved undeveloped reserves associated with various development projects at December 31, 2022 were approximately 279.4 MMBOE, which represent 39% of the Company’s total proved reserves.
Certain development projects have proved undeveloped reserves that will take more than five years to bring to production. The Company currently operates deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico that have four undeveloped locations that exceed this five-year window. Total reserves associated with the four locations amount to approximately 1% of the Company’s total proved reserves at year-end 2022. The development of certain 
PART I

reserves extends beyond five years due to limited well slot availability, thus making it necessary to wait for depletion of other wells prior to initiating further development of these locations or behind-pipe completions with significant capital costs that categorize them as undeveloped.
Murphy Oil’s Reserves Processes and Policies
As per the SEC, proved oil and natural gas reserves are “those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward.” The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
Murphy has established both internal and external controls for estimating proved reserves that follow the guidelines set forth by the SEC for oil and natural gas reporting. Certain qualified technical personnel of Murphy from the various exploration and production business units are responsible for the preparation of proved reserve estimates and these technical representatives provide the necessary information and maintain the data as well as the documentation for all properties.
Proved reserves are then consolidated and reported through the Corporate Reserves group. Murphy’s General Manager Corporate Reserves (Reserves General Manager) leads the Corporate Reserves group that also includes Corporate reserve engineers and support staff, all of which are independent of the Company’s oil and natural gas operational management and technical personnel. The Reserves General Manager joined Murphy in 2020 and has more than 31 years of industry experience. He has a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and is a also a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. The Reserves General Manager reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and makes annual presentations to the Board of Directors about the Company’s reserves. The Reserves Manager and the Corporate reserve engineers review and discuss reserves estimates directly with the Company’s technical staff in order to make every effort to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Reserves General Manager coordinates and oversees the third-party audits which are performed annually and under Company policy generally target coverage of at least one-third of the barrel oil-equivalent volume of the Company’s proved reserves.
The estimated proved reserves reported in this Form 10-K are prepared by Murphy’s employees. Internal audits may also be performed by the Reserves General Manager and qualified engineering staff from areas of the Company other than the area being audited by third parties. In 2022, 98.0% of the Proved reserves were audited by third-party auditors and they were found to be within the acceptable 10.0% tolerance by each of the third-party firms. Murphy engaged both Ryder Scott Company, L.P. and McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. to perform a reserves audit of 49.9% and 48.1% of the Company’s total proved reserves, respectively.
Each significant exploration and production business unit also maintains one or more Qualified Reserve Estimators (QRE) on staff. The QRE is responsible for estimating and evaluating reserves and other reserves information for his or her assigned area. The QRE may personally make the estimates and evaluations of reserves or may supervise and approve the estimation and evaluation thereof by others. A QRE is professionally qualified to perform these reserves estimates as a result of having sufficient educational background, professional training and professional experience to enable him or her to exercise prudent professional judgment. Larger business units of the Company also employ a Regional Reserves Coordinator (RRC) who supervises the local QREs. The RRC is usually a senior QRE who has the primary responsibility for coordinating and submitting reserves information to senior management.
QRE qualification requires a minimum of five years of practical experience in petroleum engineering or petroleum production geology, with at least three years of such experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, and either a bachelors or advanced degree in petroleum engineering, geology or other discipline of engineering or physical science from a college or university of recognized stature, or the equivalent thereof from an appropriate government authority or professional organization. Murphy provides annual training to all Company reserves estimators to ensure SEC requirements associated with reserves estimation and Form 10-K reporting are fulfilled. The training includes materials provided to each participant that outlines the latest 
PART I
Item 1. Business - Continued

guidance from the SEC as well as best practices for many engineering and geologic matters related to reserves estimation.
The Company’s QREs maintain files containing pertinent data regarding each significant reservoir. Each file includes sufficient data to support the calculations or analogies used to develop the values. Examples of data included in the file, as appropriate, include: production histories; pertinent drilling and workover histories; bottom hole pressure data; volumetric, material balance, analogy, or other pertinent reserve estimation data; production performance curves; narrative descriptions of the methods and logic used to determine reserves values; maps and logs; and a signed copy of the documentation stating that, in their opinion, the reserves have been calculated, reviewed, documented and reported in compliance with SEC regulations. Reserves calculations are completed by technical personnel with the support of the QREs and appropriately reviewed by RRCs, the Corporate reserves engineers and the Reserves General Manager. Summaries are reviewed and approved with the heads of the Company’s exploration and production business units and other senior management on an annual basis. The Company’s Controller’s department is responsible for preparing and filing reserves schedules within the Form 10-K report.
To ensure accuracy and security of reported reserves, the proved reserves estimates are coordinated in industry-standard software with access controls for approved users. In addition, Murphy complies with internal controls concerning the various business processes related to reserves.
More information regarding Murphy’s estimated quantities of proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas for the last three years are presented by geographic area on pages 112 through 119 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy currently has no oil and natural gas reserves from non-traditional sources. Murphy has not filed and is not required to file any estimates of its total proved oil or natural gas reserves on a recurring basis with any federal or foreign governmental regulatory authority or agency other than the SEC. Annually, Murphy reports gross reserves of properties operated in the United States to the U.S. Department of Energy; such reserves are derived from the same data from which estimated proved reserves of such properties are determined.
Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production and sales, and natural gas sales by geographic area with weighted average sales prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022 are shown on pages 41 through 43 of this Form 10-K report.

As used in the three tables that follow, “gross” wells are the total wells in which all or part of the working interest is owned by Murphy, and “net” wells are the total of the Company’s fractional working interests in gross wells expressed as the equivalent number of wholly-owned wells. An “exploratory” well is drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area and includes delineation wells which target a new reservoir in a field known to be productive or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area. A “development” well is drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir that is known to be productive.
The following table shows the number of oil and natural gas wells producing or capable of producing at December 31, 2022.

Sustainability 
Environment and Climate Change
We understand that our industry, and the use of our products, create emissions – which raise climate change concerns. At the same time, access to affordable, reliable energy is essential to improving the world’s quality of life and the functioning of the global economy. We believe that as the energy economy transitions, oil and natural gas will continue to play a vital role in the long-term energy mix.
We are committed to reducing our GHG emissions and are focused on understanding and mitigating our climate change risks. To guide our climate change strategy, Murphy has adopted a climate change position, and we are setting meaningful emissions reduction goals. In 2021, we endorsed the goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030, under the current World Bank definition of routine flaring. This adds to the Company’s previously established GHG emissions intensity reduction target of 15% to 20% by 2030 from our 2019 level, excluding our discontinued and divested Malaysia operations. 
Murphy recognizes that emissions are only one element of our total environmental footprint. Protecting natural resources is also an important factor in our overall sustainability efforts. See our discussion of Climate Change and Emissions on page 48.
Further, we are subject to various international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including GHG emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located.
U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA and similar state statutes impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the conduct, on current and past owners or operators of a site where a release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from regulation, in the course of our operations, we may and could generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others.
Water discharges. The U.S. Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and gas wastes, into regulated waters. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act (OPA) imposes certain duties and liabilities on the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of or that poses the substantial threat of an oil discharge, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging offshore facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. OPA also requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill.
U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) requirements. BOEM and BSEE have regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters that impose various safety, permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration, development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico and also require lessees to have substantial U.S. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met.
These include, in the Gulf of Mexico, well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment, among other items. Under applicable requirements, BOEM evaluates the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico. If the BOEM determines that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. 
Air emissions and climate change. The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations govern emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and other authorization requirements. Since 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been monitoring and regulating GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, from certain sources in the oil and gas sector due to their association

with climate change. In addition, international climate efforts, including the 2015 “Paris Agreement” and the 2021 and 2022 Conferences of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26 and COP27, respectively), have resulted in commitments from many countries to reduce GHG emissions and have called for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. 
Murphy is currently required to report GHG emissions from its U.S. operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in south Texas and in its Canadian onshore business in British Columbia and Alberta. In British Columbia and Alberta, Murphy is subject to a carbon tax on the purchase or use of many carbon-based fuels. Additionally, starting in 2017, a carbon tax began to be applied to certain operations in Alberta. Any limitations or further regulation of GHG, such as a cap and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, or expanded reporting requirements, could cause the Company to restrict operations, curtail demand for hydrocarbons generally, and/or cause costs to increase. Examples of cost increases include costs to operate and maintain facilities, install pollution emission controls and administer and manage emissions trading programs.
Endangered and threatened species. The U.S. Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. If a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds, under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and marine mammals under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
As noted above, Murphy is subject to various laws and regulatory regimes governing similar matters in other jurisdictions in which it operates. More specifically, Murphy’s operations in Canada are subject to and conducted under Canadian laws and regulations that address many of the same environmental, health and safety issues as those in the U.S., including, without limitation, pollution and contamination, air quality and emissions, water discharges and other health and safety concerns.
Health and Safety
Murphy’s commitment to safety is strong, and so are our actions to protect our workforce and communities. Our employees are our most valuable asset. Murphy strives to achieve incident-free operations through continuous improvement processes managed by the Company’s Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) Management System (HSE-MS), which engages all personnel, contractors and partners associated with Murphy operations and facilities, and provides a consistent method for integrating HSE concepts into our procedures and programs. We work hard to build a culture of safety across our organization, with regular training, exercise drills and key targeted safety initiatives.
Response to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a proactive approach was taken by Murphy and we adopted strict protocols to protect our employees and their families, contractors and the communities in which we work from the virus. Our response program was led by our Incident Management Team (IMT), under the guidance of our Crisis Management Team (CMT), leveraging the advice and recommendations of infectious disease experts and establishing safety protocols for all workers. 
Safety. The Company is subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable foreign and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information regarding hazardous materials used or produced in Murphy’s operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. In Canada, the Company is subject to Federal Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Legislation, the provincially-administered Occupational Health and Safety Act (Alberta), the Workers Compensation Act (British Columbia) and the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS).

Human Capital Management
At Murphy, we believe in providing energy that empowers people, and that is what our 691 employees do every day. As of December 31, 2022, we had 400 office-based employees and 291 field employees, all of whom are guided by our mission, vision, values and behaviors. Together with the Executive Leadership Team, the Vice President of Human Resources and Administration, who reports directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for developing and executing our human capital management strategy. This includes the attraction, recruitment, development and engagement of talent to deliver on our strategy, the design of employee compensation, health and welfare benefits, and talent programs. We focus on the following factors in order to implement and develop our human capital strategy:
•Employee Compensation Programs
•Employee Performance and Feedback
•Talent Development and Training
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
•Health and Welfare Benefits
The Board of Directors receives related updates from management on a regular basis including the review of compensation, benefits, succession and talent development and diversity, equity and inclusion.
Employee Compensation Programs 
Our purpose, to empower people, includes tying a portion of our employees’ pay to performance in a variety of ways, including incentive compensation and performance-based bonus programs, while maintaining the best interest of stockholders. We benchmark for market practices, and regularly review our compensation against the market to ensure it remains competitive to attract and retain the best talent. We believe our current practices align our employees’ compensation with the interests of our stockholders, and support our focus on cash flow generation, capital return and environmental stewardship. For further detail on the Company’s compensation framework please see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the forthcoming Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 10, 2023.
Employee Performance and Feedback
We are committed to efforts to enhance our employees’ professional growth and development through feedback that utilizes our internal performance management system (Murphy Performance Management - MPM). The purpose of the MPM process is to show our commitment to the development of all employees and to better align rewards with Company and individual performance. The goals of the MPM process are the following:
•Drive behavior to align with the Company’s mission, vision, values and behaviors
•Develop employee capabilities through effective feedback and coaching
•Maintain a process that is consistent throughout the organization to measure employee performance and is tied to Company and stockholder interests
All employees’ performance is evaluated at least annually through self-assessments that are reviewed in discussions with supervisors. Employees’ performance is evaluated on various key performance indicators set annually, including behaviors that support our mission, vision, values and contributions toward executing our company’s goals/business strategy.
Talent Development and Training
Employees are able to participate in continuous training and development, with the goal of equipping them for success and providing increased opportunities for growth at Murphy. Through our digital platform, My Murphy Learning, employees can access self-directed courses, external articles and videos that cover topics such as business, technology and productivity. We also administer mandatory compliance training for our employees through My Murphy Learning, with a 100% utilization. Further, we strive to empower our leadership, so we sponsor several programs to address career advancement for emerging leaders. Plus, we provide a tuition reimbursement program for those who choose to acquire additional knowledge to increase their effectiveness in their present position or to prepare for career advancement. Murphy holds internal technical ideas forums each year designed to share best practice and technical advances across the Company, including safety and environmental topics.

We encourage employee engagement and solicit feedback through internal surveys and our employee driven Ambassador program to gain insights into workplace experiences. Employees are provided opportunities to raise suggestions and collaborate with leadership to improve programs and increase their alignment with Murphy’s mission, vision, values and behaviors.
To monitor the effectiveness of our human capital investment and development programs, we track voluntary turnover. This data is shared on a regular basis with our Executive Leadership Team, who use it in addition to other pertinent data to develop our human capital strategy. In 2022, our voluntary employee turnover rate was 10.5%.
Health and Welfare Benefits
We believe that doing our part to aid in maintaining the health and welfare of our employees is a critical element in Murphy achieving success. As such, we provide our employees and their families with a comprehensive set of subsidized benefits that are competitive and aligned to Murphy’s mission, vision, values and behaviors. We also believe that the well-being of our employees is enhanced when they can give back to their local communities or charities either through the Company “Impact – Murphy Makes a Difference” program or on their own and receive a Company match for donations. 
In addition, we offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that provides confidential assistance to employees and their immediate family members for mental and physical well-being, as well as legal and financial issues. We also maintain an Ethics Hotline that is available to all our employees to report, anonymously if desired, any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline, which is facilitated by an independent third party, are routed to appropriate functions, Human Resources, Law or Compliance, for investigation and resolution. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering work environments that value diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). This commitment includes providing equal access to and participation in programs and services without regard to race, creed, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, age or stereotypes or assumptions based thereon. We also support interest-based groups such as sports, hobbies and charity volunteering. We welcome our employees’ differences, experiences and beliefs and we are investing in a more productive, engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. The Board of Directors receives DE&I updates on Demographic Data, Strategic Partnerships, Recruiting Strategies and Programs from management on a regular cadence. 
We seek input and program recommendations from our DE&I Committee with the support of the Executive Leadership team and through the sponsorship of our Vice President, Human Resources and Administration. Our DE&I Committee consists of diverse employees at various levels from across the organization that share a passion for DE&I. Our Board currently includes three women directors with at least one female director on each committee. Our Nominating and Governance Committee is actively focused on DE&I issues as part of its overall mandate.
