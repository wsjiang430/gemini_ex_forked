 Item 1. Business.
Overview
Wish brings an affordable and entertaining shopping experience to millions of consumers around the world. Since our founding in San Francisco in 2010, we have become one of the largest global ecommerce platforms, connecting millions of value-conscious consumers to hundreds of thousands of merchants globally. Wish combines technology and data science capabilities and an innovative discovery-based mobile shopping experience to create a highly-visual, entertaining, and personalized shopping experience for its users.
Wish’s mission “Bargains Made Fun, Discovery Made Easy” represents the company’s commitment to a unique, discovery-based shopping experience, where consumers can scroll through a varied product selection that is driven by personalization technology and complemented by robust merchandising. Wish users engage with our app in a similar manner to how they engage with social media, which is scrolling through visually-rich and interactive content. To enhance user engagement, we incorporate fresh gamified features, rich user-generated content including photos, videos, and reviews, and a wide range of relevant products to make shopping more entertaining.
We also built Wish to empower merchants around the world. While the majority of the merchants on our platform are currently based in China, we are continuing to expand our merchant base around the world. Through our diversified and global merchant base, we are able to offer greater depth and breadth of categories and products. We provide our merchants with immediate access to our global base of monthly active users (“MAUs”) and a comprehensive suite of merchant services, including demand generation and engagement, data intelligence, promotional and logistics capabilities, integration partnerships, as well as business operations support, all in a cost-efficient manner.
We launched Wish Local in 2019 to help local retailers increase their online reach and discovery, drive foot traffic, and generate additional sales by leveraging the Wish marketplace platform. Our Wish Local partners also serve as Wish Pickup locations for online Wish orders, which enables us to efficiently expand our fulfillment footprint around the world.
 Our data science capabilities provide us with a unique competitive advantage. Our proprietary algorithms analyze a rich and growing data set of transactions and historical behaviors of both users and merchants to drive continuous optimization on the platform and inform key business decisions on a daily basis. Our machine learning technology enables personalization at the individual user level at a massive scale and drives significant advantages across all aspects of our business operations, including user acquisition, user experience, user-generated content, merchant insights, and user and merchant support.
Our proprietary data and technology also create powerful network effects. The scale of our user base and active global merchants means we accumulate significant data across user and merchant activities, which we believe strengthens our data advantage, and creates an even better experience for everyone on our platform, which in turn can attract more users and merchants. As more users come to Wish, driven by the affordable value proposition and differentiated shopping experience, we can drive more sales to our merchants. Our large user base also drives our user-generated feedback loop of ratings, reviews, photos, and videos, which results in greater user engagement. As more merchants succeed on Wish, more merchants join the platform to grow their businesses, broadening our product selection which, in turn, improves the user experience. This flywheel effect has driven tremendous value to both users and merchants and has made Wish one of the largest ecommerce marketplaces in the world.
 The Wish Platform
 Our global ecommerce platform connects over 24 million MAUs in over 60 countries to approximately 170,000 active global merchants. We define MAUs as the number of unique users that visited the Wish platform, either on our mobile app, mobile web, or on a desktop, during the month. An active user is identified by a unique email-address; a single person can have multiple user accounts via multiple email addresses. We determine our number of active global merchants by counting the total number of merchants who have sold at least one order on the Wish platform, either on our mobile app, mobile web, or on a desktop, during the preceding 12 months.


Our vision is to unlock the vast potential of ecommerce for the underserved, value-oriented consumer by making the Wish platform affordable, open, and accessible to all users and merchants in many countries around the world. We do this through our relentless focus on product, technology, data science, and logistics. For our users, we are revolutionizing the mobile shopping experience by making it affordable, relevant, personalized, and entertaining. For our merchants, we offer immediate, cost-efficient access to our global user base, scaled data, and technology platform, as well as a comprehensive suite of merchant services to help run their businesses and drive sales. To serve our global and diversified user and merchant base, we approach our platform development with a specific geographic focus, enabling an authentic, localized experience.
 Value Proposition to Wish Users
We have democratized ecommerce by making it:
•Affordable. Price is the single most important determinant when making a purchase for a substantial portion of the global population, and we aim to serve the affordability needs of these value-conscious consumers. The merchants on our platform offer primarily unbranded products that can be deeply discounted as compared to branded alternatives across several categories. Our Wish Standards program, which measures the performance of merchants in areas that matter to consumers the most, promote higher quality merchants and products on our platform. This allows us to offer a vast selection of high-quality items at competitive prices, a value proposition that attracts our millions of MAUs to our platform. 
 •Accessible. We built Wish to be mobile-first so any consumer around the world can easily access our shopping platform on a mobile device. Over 90% of our user activity and purchases occur on our mobile app.
 •Everywhere. To better serve our global user base, we localize various features on our online platform and tailor our experience to each respective market through, for example, making it accessible in different languages and providing country-specific payment methods. This localization is designed to improve the engagement of our large, diverse user base, in addition to connecting our users with approximately 25,000 local brick-and-mortar Wish Local stores. 
 We have re-invented the online shopping experience to be:
•Mobile-First. Wish was built for mobile. Our application is image-rich, with minimal search input or text-based interactions. Over 90% of our user activity and purchases occur on our mobile app.
 •Discovery-Based. Our platform is designed to make it easy to navigate a vast selection of products when users do not have a specific item or brand in mind. Unlike other ecommerce platforms where consumers often visit with a predetermined purchase intent for specific items, our navigational and entertaining shopping experience gives us the ability to create purchase intent in our users across a diverse set of products and categories. Approximately 70% of the sales on our platform do not involve a search query and instead come from personalized browsing. 
 •Personalized. Personalized shopping experience is powered by machine learning technology. The more users that engage with the Wish platform, the smarter and more intuitive their product feed gets, so no two interfaces are ever the same. We deliver personalized and curated products to our users and help them discover desired products quickly.
 •Entertaining. We have transformed the user experience to make shopping on Wish as engaging and entertaining as browsing on social media. We utilize highly-personalized feeds with a wide range of relevant products as well as gamified, interactive, and social features to increase the length and frequency of a user’s sessions and drive increased engagement. 


Value Proposition to Wish Merchants
Accessible and Cost-Efficient Ecommerce Platform. We give our merchants immediate access to our global base of millions of MAUs and a comprehensive suite of merchant services in a cost-efficient manner to help them run their businesses and grow sales. We empower these highly capable merchants offering quality products at compelling values and unlock this supply of goods to consumers globally.
In addition, we give our merchants the following merchant services:
 Demand Generation and Engagement
 •Global Reach for Online Merchants. Wish gives merchants immediate access to millions of MAUs across more than 60 countries, with a significant user footprint in the United States ("U.S.") and Europe. We help our merchants reach these users in a highly targeted and cost-efficient manner.
 •Promotion. Wish merchants can amplify their reach and sales by utilizing our native advertising tool, ProductBoost. We utilize data science to optimize ad placement, target users, and maximize the merchant’s return on ad spend. 
 
User-Generated Content Creation. User-generated content that is particular, authentic, and localized can meaningfully improve user engagement and increase the purchases of products on our platform. Our value-conscious users rely on user-generated content such as reviews, ratings, photos, and videos, rather than brand recognition, when making purchase decisions. Our data science technology prioritizes items with favorable reviews, higher ratings and shipping history, connecting buyers with high-quality merchants and enhancing both the user and merchant experience.
 Data Intelligence
•Data Insight. We provide our merchants with a comprehensive data set to run their businesses through the Wish Merchant Dashboard. This dashboard helps our merchants improve their performance in terms of total impressions, overall sales, product assortment, service quality, fulfillment, shipping needs, and refunds, among others. 
 •Revenue Impact. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art data science capabilities are designed to display products to users who are most likely to buy them, in turn driving more revenue to merchants. 
 Logistics
•Shipping Logistics. With ongoing changes to global postal regulations and increases in cross-border sales volume, logistics has become paramount for small merchants to succeed in ecommerce. We have developed a number of logistics programs to provide a set of reliable cross-border logistics solutions at competitive costs for our merchants. We believe that ensuring a consistent delivery experience for our users increases value to our merchants by boosting sales volumes and minimizing returns.
 •Wish Local Partners. Through our Wish Local partnerships, our Wish Local partners also serve as Wish Pickup locations for online Wish orders. These Wish Local stores effectively give us a fulfillment footprint around the world without owning any real estate.
Business Operations
 •Optimization Tools, Services, and Education. We provide tools, services, and ongoing education to our merchant base to help them improve their business operations and drive greater success.
 •Merchant Support. Wish assists merchants with international trade compliance, payment processing, user support, and certain other services. 
 Data Science
Our machine learning and data science capabilities drive all aspects of our business. Our data advantage comes from our rich and growing data set of historical and recent user and merchant behaviors and transactions, and deep understanding of our millions of MAUs and approximately 170,000 active global merchants. All of this feeds into a proprietary data science algorithm that we continuously optimize for more intelligent insights and decision making.

Key examples of how we use data science to drive our business include:
 •User Acquisition: We leverage the power of our proprietary data to make decisions on what to show to whom, when, and through which acquisition channel, with a focus on maximizing our return on marketing investment and conversion.
 •Lifetime Value Maximization: Data science plays a critical role in maximizing lifetime value (“LTV”) of our users and optimizing the initial user acquisition investment. We use data science to determine the allocation of marketing investment across different users, marketing channels, and user acquisition and re-engagement strategies.
 •User Personalization: Our proprietary algorithms utilize a rich and growing data set of historical and recent user behaviors that includes browsing data, past transactions, reviews, and preferences noted on Wish, to display the most relevant and personalized content. This data-driven approach enables efficient and enjoyable navigation and discovery on a mobile screen, creates purchase intent across a diverse set of products, and increases conversion to sales.
 •User-Generated Content: Our platform offers mostly unbranded goods. Our value-conscious users rely on user-generated content such as reviews, ratings, photos, and videos, rather than brand recognition, when making purchase decisions. This makes the user-generated content on our platform an important source of trust and quality for our largely unbranded product selection. 
 •Merchant Insights: Our platform includes a merchant dashboard with built-in analytics to help merchants sell more products and track their performance. Our data capabilities help merchants better understand user behavior and preferences, enabling them to operate more intelligently and efficiently. 
 •ProductBoost: ProductBoost is our native advertising tool for merchants, which helps them promote their products on our platform. We utilize data science to improve the performance of ProductBoost and help maximize the merchants’ return on their ad spend. 
 •Logistics: We leverage data science to improve transparency and logistics operational efficiency for our merchants, while also reducing shipping time and improving delivery reliability for our buyers. 
 •User and Merchant Support: We use data to understand what a user or merchant is likely to need help with in order to improve the quality of support and maximize cost efficiency of providing such support.
 Our Customers
 We generate revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to our customers. We consider both the merchant and the user to be our customers. We provide a mix of marketplace services to merchants. We provide merchants access to our marketplace where merchants display and sell their products to users. We also provide a range of merchandising services including ProductBoost to help merchants promote their products within our marketplace. Our logistics offering for merchants, introduced in 2018, is designed for direct end-to-end single order shipment from a merchant’s location to the user. Logistics services include transportation and delivery of the merchant’s products to the user. Merchants are required to prepay for logistics services on a per order basis.
Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing capabilities represent a core competency that is essential to the success of the Wish platform. We are focused on continuing to acquire and retain new users and build brand awareness efficiently. Our advertising costs to acquire new users constituted 77% of our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses constituted 35% of our operating expenses, in 2022. We have extensive experience in cost-effective, data-driven digital marketing and user acquisition. We also design innovative marketing programs that help increase brand awareness by targeting people who we believe have a higher propensity to engage with our platform and buy from our merchants. We continue to partner with various social-media platforms to ensure we gain exposure with broader audiences.
 As discussed below under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Financial and Performance Metrics,” our MAUs and last-twelve-months active buyers were negatively impacted by our decision to significantly reduce our digital advertising expenditures in 2021 to focus our resources on other strategic initiatives that we believe will improve the user experience and increase retention, including (i) enhancing our product quality and selection, (ii) providing an unmatched fun and entertaining shopping experience, and (iii) improving the performance of the app. We believe our continued strategy to improve users’ experience in our marketplace and provide a more differentiated and engaging user experience will position us for long-term sustainable growth.

We currently acquire new users through a variety of marketing channels including social media, search engine optimization, affiliate marketing, and brand-oriented marketing campaigns. We rely on our data to understand consumer behavior and long term value of the consumer which guide our acquisition strategy. We also utilize data in determining how best to engage our users and seek to optimize the mode, timing and frequency of interactions across our mobile app, push notifications, and emails.
 We have invested heavily in building a talented in-house marketing team, while also developing proprietary technologies that enable us to build data-driven and highly-personalized campaigns that can scale globally on digital platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and various Google properties. Our marketing efforts also focus on re-targeting of existing users, building our brand, generating awareness, and cultivating the Wish community.
Additionally, our user base has created additional opportunities for us to reach existing and new customers organically, a venue of demand generation that supplements our paid market efforts.
 Finally, we also invest in efficient sales and marketing activities to identify and onboard high potential merchants around the world both for our online marketplace as well as Wish Local. Similar to our user acquisition strategies, we deploy digital performance marketing campaigns on social media and other channels to acquire new merchants. We supplement this effort with offline marketing activities that include attending trade shows and conducting seminars. We also leverage partnerships with third-party platforms for merchant referrals.
 Research and Development
 We have a technology and data-driven research and development culture that allows us to deliver a high-quality experience for our users and merchants. Our research and development talent is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of our platform and user experience. The vast majority of our research and development talent is located in San Francisco and Toronto. We strive to create an environment that utilizes our employees’ talents and satisfies their intellectual curiosities while promoting the development of impactful and transformative technologies.
 As a company, we invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. As of December 31, 2022, 50% of our total headcount was involved in research and development and related activities.
 Our Competition
 We compete for both users and merchants. For users, we compete on the basis of affordability and user experience. For merchants, we compete on the basis of providing profitable distribution, an end to end platform and global reach.
 Our online competitors include large, global ecommerce platforms such as Amazon, Alibaba, Pinduoduo, Shein, and Shopify as well as more traditional discount retailers such as Walmart and Target. Our offline competitors also include scaled discount retailers that offer heavily discounted and off-season products, such as Dollar General and TJ Maxx. We are able to compete for users based on our massive product selection, low prices and daily discounts, deeply-personalized and differentiated shopping experience powered by our data science and optimized for the mobile device, and entertainment derived from various engaging and interactive features of our platform.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, patents, and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names in the U.S. and in certain locations outside the U.S. Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and, to a lesser extent, patent laws, as well as confidentiality protection procedures to protect our intellectual property rights.
See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property.


Government Regulations
As with any company operating on the Internet, we are subject to a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently still evolving. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, U.S. federal and state laws, European Union Directives and Regulations, and other national laws govern the processing of payments, consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. The growing regulation of ecommerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on Wish merchants, and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and export control laws. Recent trends globally toward increased protectionism and trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that may be disruptive to our businesses.
See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to government regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, information security, and consumer protection.
Legal Proceedings
 We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, actual and threatened legal proceedings, claims, investigations and government inquiries arising in the ordinary course of our business, including legal proceedings, claims, investigations and government inquiries involving intellectual property, data privacy and data protection, torts, consumer protection, securities, employment, contractual rights or false or misleading advertising. We are also regularly subject to proceedings, claims, investigations and government inquiries seeking to hold us liable for the actions of merchants on our platform.
 Although the results of the actual and threatened legal proceedings, claims, investigations and government inquiries in which we currently are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. Regardless of the final outcome, however, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, harm to our reputation and brand, and other factors.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further discussion of risks related to legal proceedings. See also, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies, “Legal Contingencies and Proceedings,” for further discussion of current litigation.
Cyber Security
 As a data-driven company, we may be a potential target for cyber-attacks and may be exposed to a number of cybersecurity risks in the normal course of operations. Our success as a business may depend upon our ability to address these risks, and to keep our platform and internal systems secure for the benefit of our merchants, users, business partners, employees, and other stakeholders.
In order to protect our customers’ data - and any other data we manage or handle - we have adopted a number of safeguards and security measures. Among these strategies is our development and maintenance of a robust Incident Response Plan (“IRP”), which equips our employees and managers with the necessary tools to detect, respond to, and ultimately prevent cybersecurity incidents affecting the platform.
 Our IRP contains detailed processes and procedures to assist employees in managing cybersecurity incidents when they happen, including techniques for detecting/identifying suspicious activity in our data environment, response and escalation protocols to defend against intrusions and contain any potential data leakage, data preservation measures to ensure data integrity going forward, and remediation steps to diagnose root causes and secure gaps to prevent future attacks.
 The IRP is supported by a multi-tier incident response team comprised of security, technical, and legal experts across our business who are responsible for coordinating and managing data security efforts, including incident response. This cross-functional team of specialists operates under the supervision of our executive management team and holds briefings to ensure the executive group is attuned to matters of data security impacting the Company.


Finally, the IRP is also supported by a full curriculum of training for engineering and non-engineering employees that is drafted and administered under the supervision of our Director of Security. Importantly, these training sessions include several modules and quizzes for both technical and non-technical employees to assist our employees in comprehensively understanding the importance of data security to our stakeholders and our business and the various ways they can promote a security environment throughout our Company.
 For further discussion of risks related to data protection, cyber security, and intellectual property, please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” below.
 Human Capital
 We are continually investing in the engagement and retention of our global workforce by creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, providing market-competitive benefits to support our employees’ health and well-being, and fostering an environment of learning and growth in support of employee development.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 886 full-time employees worldwide, of which 490 are located in the U.S. Our team includes employees in 10 countries, spread across 4 continents, reflecting various cultures, backgrounds and ethnicities. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. On January 31, 2023, we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by up to 150 employees, representing 17% of our then global workforce. This plan is intended to refocus our operations to support our ongoing business prioritization efforts, better align resources, and improve operational efficiencies. See the sections titled Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—January 2023 Reduction in Workforce” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13. Subsequent Events”, for further discussion of our reduction in workforce.
 None of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In certain countries in which we operate, we may be subject to, and need to comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We may be required to comply with the terms of these collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Fostering Organizational Diversity
 As a global business with users and merchants in more than 60 countries, we understand that our ability to harness the power of diverse perspectives within our organization is crucial to our success in serving those customers effectively. Wish is committed to organizational diversity in all areas of our workforce and will continue to pursue meaningful diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. As of December 31, 2022, our employee base was 57% male and 42% female, and our Board of Directors was 60% male and 40% female.
Promoting an Inclusive Workplace
 
In addition to fostering diversity in all categories and across all levels of our organization, we are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive workplace free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, citizenship, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability, medical condition, or any other status protected by applicable law.
 As a part of this effort, we deploy a variety of different tools to ensure a welcoming workplace for employees and business partners of all backgrounds, including:
 •Robust policies and a Company code of conduct prohibiting discrimination and harassment in the workplace;
 •A clearly communicated and routinely reinforced policy that management and employees alike are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace;.
 •The establishment of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) targeted at building community and fostering communication across cultural, ethnic, and religious lines, including those focused on people of color, LGBTQ+, and gender communities; and
 •Recognition and celebration of various ethnic, religious, and cultural awareness holidays and other observances.
 We have also established various training programs to promote a welcoming workplace, including:
 •Annual training for employees and managers relating to topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as training to counteract bias in the workplace; and


•In 2022, we incorporated elements of bias identification and approaches to reject biases in our performance evaluations such as writing feedback using the Situation-Behavior-Impact (“SBI”) framework. 
 Employee Development and Training
 Our employees are critical to the success of our company and we strive to create a supportive environment where all can contribute, learn, and grow in their careers. We prioritize employee development and training, and seek to foster both formal and informal learning opportunities inside and outside of the Company.
 We provide an annual professional development stipend, which employees and managers can use for reimbursement of professional development expenses including seminars, courses, books, and training programs. We believe our investment in employee development has a direct impact on employee growth, engagement, and retention and is critical to our Company’s success.
 To further support managers and individual contributors at Wish, most of whom work remotely due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, we also provide virtual training and development opportunities, including:
 •Writing Effective Feedback Review (offered to all employees);
 •Performance Management Training (offered to all managers);
 •Amazon Web Service Training for Engineering Teams; and
 •Manager Handbook for Managers in Technology Organization.
 Employee Benefits and Retention Strategies
 We provide employees competitive benefits and additional perks to support the health and well-being of all, including:
 •Comprehensive Health, Dental, and Vision Care - We offer an array of healthcare, financial, and Wellness Benefits, to employees and their dependents at no cost to employees. Employees can choose from a variety of two different healthcare providers (three medical plan offerings total), including supplemental health voluntary coverage that fits the needs of our employees and their families.
 •Mental Health and Well-Being Support - Our Wellness services include access to services from various providers. We provide an annual allotment to employees to access these services and annual education reimbursements for career development.
 •Competitive Parental Leave Policies - 16 weeks of parental leave for birthing parents and 10 weeks for non-birthing parents.
 Flexibility and Decentralization
 In the first quarter of 2022, we made a decision to shift towards a primarily remote working environment in which most employees will have the option to work from home even after we reopen our offices.
 In 2023, we expect to begin rolling-out a more formalized “return to office” protocol for our workforce located in the San Francisco metropolitan area, while still providing a flexible working environment.
 We believe the above flexible working policy will unlock further opportunities to source, connect, hire, and retain talent in more locations while also enabling us to cultivate a vibrant, collaborative office environment at our San Francisco headquarters and beyond.
