ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General
CompX International Inc. (NYSE American: CIX), incorporated in Delaware in 1993, is a leading manufacturer of security products used in the postal, recreational transportation, office and institutional furniture, cabinetry, tool storage, healthcare and a variety of other industries. We are also a leading manufacturer of wake enhancement systems, stainless steel exhaust systems, gauges, throttle controls and trim tabs for the recreational marine industry. Our products are principally designed for use in medium to high-end product applications where design, quality and durability are valued by our customers.
At December 31, 2022, NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL) owns approximately 87% of our outstanding common stock, Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) owns approximately 83% of NL’s outstanding common stock and a subsidiary of Contran Corporation owns approximately 92% of Valhi’s outstanding common stock. As discussed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, a majority of Contran’s outstanding voting stock is held directly by Lisa K. Simmons and various family trusts established for the benefit of Ms. Simmons, Thomas C. Connelly (the husband of Ms. Simmons’ late sister) and their children and for which Ms. Simmons or Mr. Connelly, as applicable, serve as trustee (collectively, the “Other Trusts”). With respect to the Other Trusts for which Mr. Connelly serves as trustee, he is required to vote the shares of Contran voting stock held in such trusts in the same manner as Ms. Simmons. Such voting rights of Ms. Simmons last through April 22, 2030 and are personal to Ms. Simmons. The remainder of Contran’s outstanding voting stock is held by another trust (the “Family Trust”), which was established for the benefit of Ms. Simmons and her late sister and their children and for which a third-party financial institution serves as trustee. Consequently, at December 31, 2022, Ms. Simmons and the Family Trust may be deemed to control Contran, and therefore may be deemed to indirectly control the wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran, Valhi, NL and us.
Our corporate offices are located at Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas 75240. Our telephone number is (972) 448-1400. We maintain a website at www.compxinternational.com.
Unless otherwise indicated, references in this report to “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to CompX International Inc. and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Industry Overview
We manufacture engineered components utilized in a variety of applications and industries. We manufacture mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in postal, recreational transportation, office and institutional furniture, cabinetry, tool storage and healthcare applications. We also manufacture wake enhancement systems, stainless steel exhaust systems, gauges, throttle controls, trim tabs and related hardware and accessories for the recreational marine and other industries. We continuously seek to diversify into new markets and identify new applications and features for our products, which we believe provide a greater potential for higher rates of earnings growth as well as diversification of risk. See also Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Business Segments
We have two operating business segments – Security Products and Marine Components. For additional information regarding our segments, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Manufacturing, Operations and Products
Security Products. Our Security Products segment manufactures mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in a variety of applications including mailboxes, ignition systems, file cabinets, desk drawers, tool storage cabinets, high security medical cabinetry, integrated inventory and access control secured narcotics boxes, electronic circuit panels, storage compartments, gas station security, vending and cash containment machines. Our Security Products segment has one manufacturing facility in Mauldin, South Carolina and one in Grayslake, Illinois which is shared with Marine Components. We believe we are a North American market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms. These products include:

● | disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock we produce;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​


● | pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security, including KeSet® and System 64® (which each allow the user to change the keying on a single lock 64 times without removing the lock from its enclosure), TuBar® and Turbine™; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our innovative CompX eLock® and StealthLock® electronic locks which provide stand-alone or networked security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card, magnetic stripe, radio frequency or other keypad credential.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A substantial portion of our Security Products’ sales consist of products with specialized adaptations to an individual customer’s specifications, some of which are listed above. We also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers, which is offered through a North American distribution network to locksmith and smaller original equipment manufacturer distributors via our STOCK LOCKS® distribution program.
Marine Components. Our Marine Components segment manufactures and distributes wake enhancement systems, stainless steel exhaust components, gauges, throttle controls, trim tabs and related hardware and accessories primarily for ski/wakeboard boats (tow boats) and performance boats.

--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | grab handles, pin cleats and other accessories.
--+------------------------------------------------

For information regarding our three principal manufacturing facilities, see “Item 2 – Properties.”
Raw Materials
Our primary raw materials are:

● | Security Products - zinc and brass (for the manufacture of locking mechanisms).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marine Components - stainless steel (for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and wake enhancement systems), aluminum (for the manufacture of throttles and trim tabs) and other components.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers, are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately 17% of our total cost of sales for 2022. Total material costs, including purchased components, represented approximately 47% of our cost of sales in 2022.
We occasionally enter into short-term commodity-related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future price increases in commodity-related raw materials, including zinc, brass and stainless steel. These arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes, which help us to stabilize our commodity-related raw material costs to a certain extent. At other times we may make spot market buys of larger quantities of raw materials to take advantage of favorable pricing or volume-based discounts. Prices for the primary commodity-related raw materials used in the manufacture of our locking mechanisms, primarily zinc and brass, generally increased throughout 2021 and the first half of 2022. Prices began to stabilize in the latter half of 2022, although at elevated levels. The prices for stainless steel, the primary raw material used for the manufacture of marine exhaust headers and pipes and wake enhancement systems, experienced significant volatility during 2021 and 2022. Based on current economic conditions, we expect the prices for zinc, brass, stainless steel and other manufacturing materials in 2023 to be relatively stable, although at the elevated levels we experienced in the second half of 2022. When purchased on the spot market,

​

each of these raw materials may be subject to sudden and unanticipated price increases. When possible, we seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions. In the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions, it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets in which we compete. Consequently, overall operating margins can be affected by commodity-related raw material cost pressures. Commodity market prices are cyclical, reflecting overall economic trends, specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities.
Patents and Trademarks
We hold a number of patents relating to our component products, certain of which we believe to be important to us and our continuing business activity. Patents generally have a term of 20 years, and our patents have remaining terms ranging from 1 year to 18 years at December 31, 2022.
Our major trademarks and brand names in addition to CompX® include:

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
A majority of our component sales are direct to large OEM customers through our factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer’s representatives. We select manufacturer’s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers.
In addition to sales to large OEM customers, a substantial portion of our Security Products sales are made through distributors. We have a significant North American market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel. We support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace. These products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users.
We sell to a diverse customer base with only two customers representing 10% or more of our sales in 2022 (United States Postal Service representing 14% and Malibu Boats, LLC representing 12%). Our largest ten customers accounted for approximately 52% of our sales in 2022.
Competition
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product design, including space utilization and aesthetic factors, product quality and durability, price, on-time delivery, service and technical support. We focus our efforts on the middle and high-end segments of the market, where product design, quality, durability and service are valued by the customer. Our Security Products segment competes against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. Our Marine Components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
We seek to operate our business in line with sound ESG principles that include corporate governance, social responsibility, sustainability and cybersecurity. We believe ESG means conducting operations with high standards of environmental and social responsibility, practicing exemplary ethical standards, focusing on safety as a top priority, respecting human rights and supporting our local communities, and continuously developing our employees. At our facilities, we undertake various environmental sustainability programs, and we promote social responsibility and volunteerism through programs designed to support and give back to the local communities in which we operate. Each of our locations maintains site-specific safety programs and disaster response and business continuity plans. All manufacturing facilities have detailed, site-specific emergency response procedures that we believe adequately address regulatory compliance, vulnerability to potential hazards, emergency response and action plans, employee training, alarms and warning systems and crisis communication.
At a corporate level, we engage in periodic reviews of our cybersecurity programs, including cybersecurity risk and threats. Our cybersecurity programs are built on operations and compliance foundations. Operations focus on continuous detection, prevention, measurement, analysis, and response to cybersecurity alerts and incidents and on emerging threats. Compliance establishes oversight of our cybersecurity programs by creating risk-based controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, accessibility, and availability of company data stored, processed, or transferred. We periodically update our board of directors on our cyber-related risks and cybersecurity programs. 
In an effort to align our non-employee directors’ financial interests with those of our stockholders, our Board established share ownership guidelines for our non-management directors. 
Regulatory and Environmental Matters
We have a history of incorporating environmental management and compliance in our operations and decision making. We operate three low-emission manufacturing facilities and our production processes requiring waste-water discharge are consolidated at our Mauldin, South Carolina facility. This facility has received a ReWa Gold Award multiple years for its exemplary performance from Renewable Water Resources, an organization which sets regulatory and water policies for the Mauldin facility’s geographic region. In addition, we operate extensive scrap metal recycling programs to reduce landfill waste.
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations. To date, the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results. We currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters; however, it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures.
Human Capital Resources
Employees – Our operating results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. We have a well-trained labor force with a substantial number of long-tenured employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits to our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs can include annual bonuses, defined contribution plans with employer matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 609 people, all in the United States. We believe our labor relations are good.
Health and Safety – Protecting the health and safety of our workforce, our customers, our business partners and the natural environment is one of our core values. We are committed to maintaining a strong safety culture where all workers meet or exceed required industry performance standards and continuously seek to improve occupational and process safety performance. We are conducting our business in ways that provide all personnel with a safe and healthy work environment and have established safety and environmental programs and goals to achieve such results. We expect

​

our manufacturing facilities to produce our products safely and in compliance with local regulations, policies, standards and practices intended to protect the environment and people, and we have established policies designed to promote such compliance. We require our employees to comply with such requirements. We provide our workers with the tools and training necessary to make the appropriate decisions to prevent accidents and injuries. Each of our operating facilities develops, maintains, and implements safety programs encompassing key aspects of their operations. In addition, management reviews and evaluates safety performance throughout the year. We monitor conditions that could lead to a safety incident and keep track of injuries through reporting systems in accordance with laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We track this data to assess the quality of our safety performance. We use lost time incidents as a key measure of worker safety. We define lost time incidents as work-related accidents where a worker sustains an injury that results in time away from work. We had lost time incidents of nil in 2020, one in 2021 and three in 2022.
Diversity and Inclusion – We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment. We embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce and our business initiatives. We are an equal opportunity employer and we base employment decisions on merit, competence and qualifications, without regard to race, color, national origin, gender, age, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation or other characteristics protected by applicable law in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We promote a respectful, diverse and inclusive workplace in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
