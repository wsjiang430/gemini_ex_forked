ITEM 1.    Business 
Our History 
On January 3, 2017, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (“Hilton”) completed a tax-free spin-off of each of HGV and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park”). As a result of the spin-off, HGV became an independent publicly traded company with common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HGV.” Following the spin-off, Hilton did not retain any ownership in our company. In connection with the spinoff, we entered into agreements with Hilton and other third parties, including licenses to use the Hilton Grand Vacations brand. For more information regarding these agreements, see “—Business—Key Agreements with Hilton Worldwide Holdings.” 
On August 2, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Dakota Holdings, Inc. (“Diamond”), the parent of Diamond Resorts International (the “Diamond Acquisition”), by exchanging 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Diamond for shares of HGV common stock. Pre-existing HGV shareholders owned approximately 72% of the combined company immediately after giving effect to the Diamond Acquisition, with certain funds controlled by Apollo Global Management Inc. (“Apollo”) and other minority shareholders, which previously owned 100% of Diamond, holding the remaining approximately 28% at the time the Diamond Acquisition was completed.
The acquired portfolio of resort properties are included in Diamond's single- and multi-use trusts (collectively, the “Diamond Collections” or “Collections”), or are stand-alone Diamond branded resorts in which we own inventory. In addition, there are affiliated resorts and hotels, which we do not manage, and which do not carry the Diamond brand but are a part of Diamond's network and, through THE Club® and other Club offerings (collectively the “Diamond Clubs”), are available for its members to use as vacation destinations.
Our Business
We are a global timeshare company engaged in developing, marketing, selling, managing and operating timeshare resorts, timeshare plans and ancillary reservation services, primarily under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand. Our Company also owns and operates Legacy-Diamond resorts and sales centers that have been acquired through the Diamond Acquisition, which are undergoing rebranding. Our operations primarily consist of: selling vacation ownership intervals and vacation ownership interests (collectively, “VOIs”, “VOI”) for us and third parties; financing and servicing loans provided to consumers for their timeshare purchases; operating resorts and timeshare plans; and managing both our points-based Hilton Grand Vacations Club and Hilton Club exchange program (collectively the “Legacy-HGV Club”) and the Diamond points-based multi-resort timeshare plans and exchange programs (the “Legacy-Diamond Clubs”). 
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 150 properties located in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe, Mexico, the Caribbean, Canada, and Japan. A significant number of our properties and VOIs are concentrated in Florida, Europe, Hawaii, California, Arizona, Nevada and Virginia. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 519,000 members across our club offerings. Legacy-HGV Club members have the flexibility to exchange their VOIs for stays at any Hilton Grand Vacations Club resort or any property in the Hilton system of 19 industry-leading brands across approximately 7,000 properties, as well as numerous experiential vacation options, such as cruises and guided tours, or they have the option to exchange their VOI for various other timeshare resorts throughout the world through an external exchange program. Legacy-Diamond Club members are able to utilize their points across the Diamond resorts, affiliated properties and alternative experiential options.
During 2022, we began offering a new club membership called HGV Max across certain of our sales centers. For any customer who purchases a VOI, this membership provides the ability to use points across all properties within our network. The membership provides new destinations for both Legacy-HGV and Legacy-Diamond club owners and broader vacation opportunities for new buyers. It also combines the best benefits from both Club programs, making Hilton hotel benefits available to Legacy-Diamond Club owners and new travel benefits, Hilton hotel discounts and alternative experiential options available to Legacy-HGV Club owners. The Legacy-HGV Club, Legacy-Diamond Clubs and HGV Max are collectively referred to as “Clubs”.
Our compelling VOI product allows customers to advance purchase a lifetime of vacations. Because our VOI owners generally purchase only the vacation time they intend to use each year, they are able to efficiently split the full cost of owning and maintaining a vacation residence with other owners. Our customers also benefit from the amenities and service at our Hilton-branded resorts and Diamond resorts. Furthermore, our points-based platform offers members tremendous flexibility, enabling us to more effectively adapt to their changing vacation needs over time. Building on the strength of that platform, we continuously seek new ways to add value to our Legacy-HGV Club membership and Legacy-Diamond Club membership, including enhanced product offerings, greater geographic distribution, broader exchange networks and further technological innovation, all of which drive better, more personalized vacation experiences and guest satisfaction. 
As innovators in the timeshare business, we enhance our inventory strategy by developing an inventory mix focused on developed properties as well as fee-for-service and just-in-time agreements to sell VOIs on behalf of or acquired from third-party developers.
Our Reportable Segments 
We operate our business across two segments: (1) real estate sales and financing and (2) resort operations and club management. For more information regarding our segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in Item 7, and Note 22: Business Segments in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our real estate sales and financing segment primarily generates revenue from: 
•VOI Sales—We sell our owned inventory and interests directly and, through our fee-for-service agreements, we sell VOIs on behalf of third-party developers using the Hilton Grand Vacations brand in exchange for sales, marketing and brand fees. Under these fee-for-service agreements, we earn commission fees based on a percentage of total interval sales. See “—Inventory and Development Activities” and “—Marketing and Sales Activities” below for further information. 
•Financing—We provide consumer financing, which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to members to finance their purchase of VOIs owned by us. We also generate fee revenue from servicing the loans provided by third-party developers to purchasers of their VOIs. See “—Financing Activities” below for information regarding our consumer financing activities. 
Our resort operations and club management segment primarily generates revenue from: 
•Resort Management—Our resort management services primarily consist of operating properties under management agreements for the benefit of homeowners’ associations (“HOA”s) of VOI owners at both our resorts and those developed by third parties. Our management agreements with HOAs provide for a cost-plus management fee, which means we generally earn a fee equal to 10% to 15% of the costs to operate the applicable resort. See “—Resort and Club Management Activities” below for information regarding our resort management activities. 
•Club Management—We operate and manage the Clubs and receive annual membership fees as well as incremental fees depending on exchanges and transactions members choose for other vacation products and services within the Club system. 
•Rental of Available Inventory—We generate rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges through our Clubs programs. This allows us to utilize otherwise unoccupied inventory to generate additional revenues. We also earn fee revenue from the rental of inventory owned by third parties as well as revenue from retail, spa and other outlets at our timeshare properties. See “—Resort and Club Management Activities” below for further information. 
Other than the United States, there were no countries that individually represented more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Our VOI and Club Products 
Each property provides a distinctive setting, while signature elements remain consistent, such as high-quality guest service, spacious units and extensive on-property amenities. Most resorts feature studio to three-bedroom condominium-style accommodations and amenities such as full kitchens, in-unit washers and dryers, spas and kids’ clubs. Our timeshare properties are relatively concentrated in significant tourist markets, including Florida, Europe, Hawaii, California, Arizona, Nevada and Virginia. 
Our primary Legacy-HGV VOI product that we market and sell is fee-simple, deeded in perpetuity and right to use real estate interests, developed either by us or by third parties. This ownership interest is generally equivalent to one week on an annual or biennial basis, at the timeshare resort in which the VOI is located. Purchasers of a Legacy-HGV VOI also become members of a Legacy-HGV Club which allows the member to exchange their points for a number of vacation options. In addition to an annual membership fee, members pay incremental fees depending on exchange or services they choose.
Our primary Legacy-Diamond VOI product, which we acquired in the Diamond Acquisition, that we market and sell is a beneficial interest in one of our Collections, which are represented by an annual or biennial allotment of points that can be utilized for vacations at any of the resorts in that Collection. In general, purchasers of VOI in a Collection do not acquire a direct ownership interest in the resort properties in the Collection. Rather, for each Collection, one or more 
trustees hold legal title to the deeded fee simple real estate interests or the functional equivalent, or, in some cases, leasehold real estate interests for the benefit of the respective Collection’s association members in accordance with the applicable agreements. Purchasers of a Legacy-Diamond VOI are also offered the opportunity to become members of a Legacy-Diamond Club through which they can exchange their points for a number of vacation options. In addition to an annual membership fee, members pay transaction fees depending upon the exchange or service options they choose.
Persons who become members of the Legacy-HGV Club or Legacy-Diamond’s The Club through the purchase of a qualifying VOI from an authorized HGV sales center become HGV Max members in their respective Club through which such members have access to more properties in more destinations and discounts across the Hilton portfolio of hotels and resorts. Specifically, along with other benefits, HGV Max members of a Legacy-HGV Club have access to resorts available in The Club. Likewise, HGV Max members of The Club have access to resorts available within the Legacy-HGV Club. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 519,000 members across our various club offerings.
Inventory and Development Activities 
We secure VOI inventory by developing or acquiring resorts in strategic markets, building additional phases at our existing resorts, re-acquiring inventory from owners in default and in the open market and sourcing inventory from third-party developers through fee-for-service and just-in-time transactions.
Our development activities involving the acquisition of real estate are followed by construction or renovation to create individual vacation ownership units. These development activities, and the related management of construction activities, are performed either by us or third-party developers. The development and construction of the units require a large upfront investment of capital and can take several years to complete in the case of a ground-up project. Additionally, the VOIs must be legally registered prior to sale to our end customers. This investment cannot be recovered until the individual VOIs are sold to purchasers which can take several years. Traditionally, timeshare operators have funded 100% of the investment necessary to acquire land and construct timeshare properties.
We also source VOIs through fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers. These agreements enable us to generate fees from the marketing and sale of Hilton-branded VOIs and Legacy-HGV Club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund up-front acquisition and construction costs or incur unsold inventory maintenance costs. The capital investment we make in connection with these projects is typically limited to the cost of constructing our on-site sales centers. In just-in-time transactions, we acquire and sell inventory in transactions that are designed to closely correlate the timing of our acquisition of inventory with our sale of that inventory to purchasers. We refer to fee-for-service transactions and just-in-time sales as “capital-efficient transactions.” Over time, these capital-efficient transactions have evolved from sourcing inventory from distressed properties to sourcing from new construction projects. For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales from fee-for-service and just-in-time inventory were 29% and 15% of contract sales, respectively. The estimated contract sales value related to our inventory that is currently available for sale at open or soon-to-be open projects and inventory at new or existing projects that will become available for sale in the future upon registration, delivery or construction is approximately $11 billion at current pricing. Capital-efficient arrangements represent approximately 39% of that supply. Our fee-for-service sales generally improve returns on invested capital and liquidity, while sales of owned inventory, including just-in-time inventory, typically result in a greater contribution to the profitability of our real estate sales and financing segment.
Owners can generally offer their VOIs for resale on the secondary market, which can create pricing pressure on the sale of developer inventory. Given the structure of our Legacy-HGV products, purchasers of Legacy-HGV VOIs on the secondary market will generally become a Legacy-HGV Club member. Purchasers of a Legacy-Diamond VOI on the secondary market may elect to join a Legacy-Diamond Club. Once a member of the Clubs, the member will be responsible for paying annual fees. All purchasers will be responsible for paying applicable maintenance fees, property taxes and any assessments that are levied by the relevant HOA. While we do not have an obligation to repurchase intervals previously sold, most of our VOIs provide us with a right of first refusal on secondary market sales. We monitor sales that occur in the secondary market and exercise our right of first refusal in certain cases. 
Marketing and Sales Activities 
Our marketing and sales activities are based on targeted direct marketing and a highly personalized sales approach. We use targeted direct marketing to reach potential members who are identified as having the financial ability to pay for our products, are frequent leisure travelers and have an affinity with our brands. Tour flow quality impacts key metrics such as close rate and VPG, defined in “Key Business and Financial Metrics and Terms Used by Management—Real Estate Sales Metrics.” Additionally, the quality of tour flows impacts sales revenue and the collectability of our timeshare financing receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 71% of our contract sales were to our existing owners.
We sell our vacation ownership products through our distribution network of both in-market and off-site sales centers. Our products are currently marketed for sale throughout the United States, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Japan. We operate sales distribution centers in major markets and popular leisure destinations with year-round demand and a history of being a friendly environment for vacation ownership. We have approximately 50 sales distribution centers in various domestic and international locations. A phased rebranding of the Legacy-Diamond acquired sales centers began in late 2021. 
Our sales tours are designed to provide potential members with an overview of our company and our products, as well as a customized presentation to explain how our products can meet their vacationing needs. Our sales centers use proprietary sales technology to deliver a highly transparent and customized sales approach. Consumers place a great deal of trust in the Hilton brand, and we believe that preserving that trust is essential. We hire our sales associates using an assessment-based, candidate screening system, which is a proprietary tool we use to uphold our selection criteria. Once hired, we emphasize training, professionalism and product knowledge, and our sales associates receive significant product and sales training before interacting with potential members. Most U.S.-based sales associates are licensed real estate agents and a real estate broker is involved with each sales center. We manage consistency of sales presentation and team member professionalism using a variety of sales tools and technology and through a post-presentation survey of our tour guests. Our focus is on treating members and guests with the highest degree of respect. 
Financing Activities 
We originate loans for members purchasing our developed and acquired VOIs who qualify according to our underwriting criteria. We generate interest income from the spread between the revenue generated on loans originated less our costs to fund and service those loans. We also earn fee revenue from servicing our own portfolio and the loans provided by third-party developers of our fee-for-service projects to purchasers of their VOIs. 
Our timeshare financing receivables are collateralized by the underlying VOIs and are generally structured as 10-year, fully-amortizing loans that bear a fixed interest rate ranging from 2.5% to 25% per annum. The interest rate on our loans is determined by, among other factors, the amount of the down payment, the borrower’s credit profile and the loan term. As of December 31, 2022, the average loan outstanding was approximately $23,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 14.7%.
Prepayment is permitted without penalty. When a member defaults, we ultimately return their VOI to inventory for resale and that member no longer participates in our Clubs. 
We have a revolving timeshare receivable credit facility (“Timeshare Facility”). We periodically securitize timeshare financing receivables we originate in connection with the sale of VOIs to monetize receivables and achieve an efficient return on capital and manage our working capital needs. 
Timeshare Financing Receivables Origination 
In underwriting each loan, we obtain a credit application and a minimum down payment of 10% of the purchase price on the majority of sales of VOIs. For U.S. and Canadian purchasers seeking financing, which represented approximately 90% of the individuals we provided financing to over the last three years, we apply the credit evaluation score methodology developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) to credit files compiled and maintained by Experian and Equifax. Higher credit scores equate to lower collection risk and lower credit scores equate to higher collection risk. Over the last three years, the weighted-average FICO score for loans to U.S. and Canadian borrowers at the time of origination was 736 (out of a maximum potential score of 850). For non-North American purchasers seeking financing, consisting principally of purchasers in Japan, we generally observe that these borrowers have experienced default rates comparable to U.S. and Canadian borrowers within the 750 to 774 FICO score band. 
Our underwriting standards are influenced by the changing economic and financial market conditions. We have the ability to modify our down payment requirements and credit thresholds in the face of stronger or weaker market conditions. Our underwriting standards have resulted in a strong, well-seasoned consumer loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, our entire portfolio consists of originated loans and loans that were acquired as part of the Diamond Acquisition, which are referred to as acquired loans. As of December 31, 2022, the entire portfolio had a gross balance of approximately $2,468 million derived from approximately 107,000 loans. The portfolio had a weighted average length of loan of 10 years and the weighted average remaining length of loan of 8 years. 
We also finance our working capital needs in part by borrowing against timeshare financing receivables. In general, we seek to use the majority of our financed VOI sales as collateral to borrow against the Timeshare Facility and subsequently transfer those loans into a term securitization after the loans have seasoned and an appropriately sized portfolio has been assembled. We target securitizations that range in size from $250 million to $350 million and we expect the timing of future securitizations will depend on our anticipated sales volume, financing propensity and capital needs. 
The strong performance of our outstanding loan securitizations demonstrates that loans originated by us are well regarded for their performance in the securitization market. In the future, we expect to regularly access the term securitization market, replenishing capacity on our Timeshare Facility in the process. 
Loan Portfolio Servicing 
We have a skilled, integrated consumer finance team. This team is responsible for payment processing and loan servicing, collections, default recovery and portfolio reporting and analytics. Accounts more than 30 days past due are deemed delinquent. We reserve for all loans based on our static pool method. When a loan associated with a product is more than 120 days past due, it is reserved at 100%. Arrangements are then made to recover the interval through various processes depending on the type of inventory and regulatory requirements which could include a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure. 
We monitor numerous metrics including collection rates, defaults and bankruptcies. Our consumer finance team is also responsible for selecting and processing loans pledged or to be pledged in our securitizations and preparing monthly servicing reports. 
Resort and Club Management Activities 
Resort Management 
Prior to the initiation of VOI sales at a timeshare resort owned by us or by a third party with whom we have entered into a fee-for-service agreement, we enter into a management agreement with the relevant HOA. Each of the HOAs are governed by a board of directors comprised of owner or developer representatives that are charged with ensuring that the resorts are well-maintained and financially stable. Our services include day-to-day operations of the resorts, maintenance of the resorts, preparation of books and financial records including, reports, budgets and projections, arranging for annual audits and maintenance fee billing and collections and personal employment training and oversight. Our HOA management agreements provide for a cost-plus management fee, which means we generally earn a fee between 10% and 15% of the costs to operate the applicable resort. As a result, the fees we earn are highly predictable, unlike traditional revenue-based hotel management fees, and our management fees generally are unaffected by changes in rental rate or occupancy. Further, because maintenance fees are paid annually by owners, our management fees are recurring and less volatile than hotel management fees. We are also reimbursed for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. The original term of our management agreements is typically governed by state timeshare laws and ranges from three to five years. The agreements generally are subject to automatic renewal for one- to three-year periods unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term. Since our inception, none of the management agreements relating to our developed or fee-for-service properties have been terminated or lapsed, including management agreements obtained as part of the Diamond Acquisition.
To fund resort operations, owners are assessed an annual maintenance fee, which includes our management fee. In 2022, HOAs collected approximately $1,016 million in maintenance fees, including our applicable management fees, which is net of our contributions to the HOAs for unsold VOIs that we own. Because these funds are collected early in the year, we have substantial visibility of collection. These fees represent each owner’s allocable share of the management fee and the costs of operating and maintaining the resorts, which generally includes personnel, property taxes, insurance, a capital asset reserve to fund refurbishment and other related costs. If a VOI owner defaults on payment of its maintenance fees and there is no lien against the mortgage note or contract, the HOA has the right to recover the defaulting owner’s VOI. As a service to HOAs at certain owned resorts, subject to our inventory needs, we have the ability to reduce the bad debt expense at the HOAs by assuming the defaulted owner’s obligations in exchange for an agreed purchase price. We are then able to resell those VOIs through our normal distribution channels. 
A portion of the annual maintenance fees collected from owners each year is set aside as a capital asset reserve for property renovations. The renovations funded by these fees enable HOAs to keep properties modern, which helps our branded properties consistently receive among the highest quality assurance scores within the Hilton portfolio of brands. HOAs engage an independent consulting firm to compile a reserve study. Typically, HOAs budget the reserve study to target property renovations on a 6- and 12-year cycle. HOAs generally replace soft goods every six years and hard goods every 12 years. These reserves also benefit our members by limiting the risk of special assessments and steep increases in maintenance fees due to deferred capital expenditures. 
Club Management 
We also manage and operate our Clubs providing exclusive exchange, leisure travel and reservation services to our Club members. When owners purchase a VOI, they are generally enrolled in a Club which allows the member to exchange their points for a number of vacation options. In addition to an annual membership fee, Club members pay incremental fees depending on exchanges they choose within the Club system.
Rental of Available Inventory 
We rent unsold VOI inventory, third-party inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges through our Clubs programs. By using our websites, Hilton’s websites and other direct booking channels to rent available inventory, we are able to reach potential new members that may already have an affinity for and loyalty to the Hilton brands and introduce them to our products. Inventory rentals allow us to utilize otherwise unoccupied inventory to generate additional revenues and provision of ancillary services. We earn a fee from rentals of third-party inventory. Additionally, we provide ancillary offerings including food and beverage, retail and spa offerings at these timeshare properties. 
Competition 
The timeshare industry has historically been highly competitive and comprised of a number of national and regional companies that develop, finance and operate timeshare properties. 
Our timeshare business competes with other timeshare developers for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility for members to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards, including access to hotel loyalty programs, as well as brand name recognition and reputation. We also compete for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment objectives as us. We own certain other trademarks and trade names for various properties. In the competitive industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important to the marketing and sales of our products. There is also significant competition for talent at all levels within the industry, in particular for sales and management. Our primary competitors in the timeshare space include Marriott Vacations Worldwide, Travel + Leisure Co., Disney Vacation Club, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, Westgate Resorts and Bluegreen Vacations. 
In addition, our timeshare business competes with other entities engaged in the leisure and vacation industry, including resorts, hotels, cruises and other accommodation alternatives, such as condominium and single-family home rentals. We also compete with home and apartment sharing services that operate websites that market available privately-owned residential properties that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. In certain markets, we compete with established independent timeshare operators, and it is possible that other potential competitors may develop properties near our current resort locations. In addition, we face competition from other timeshare management companies in the management of resorts on behalf of owners on the basis of quality, cost, types of services offered and relationship. We compete with other timeshare companies for off-site sales centers, through which we market our products to potential members, including in locations like high-traffic shopping centers and tourist attractions in leisure destinations.
Recent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented timeshare industry may increase competition. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 
We generally do not face competition in our consumer financing business to finance sales of our VOIs. However, we do face competition from financial institutions providing other forms of consumer credit, which may lead to full or partial prepayment of our timeshare financing receivables. 
Seasonality and Cyclicality 
We experience modest seasonality in timeshare sales at certain resorts, with stronger revenue generation during traditional vacation periods for those locations. Our business is moderately cyclical as the demand for VOIs is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of VOIs, as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the travel industry. 
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to various international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions in which we operate. Some laws, regulations and policies impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations under the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions outside the U.S. generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect one of our areas of business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; consumer financing, lending and related activities; and resort and club management activities. We will continue to be subject to applicable new legislation, rules and regulations that have been proposed, or may be proposed, by federal, state and local authorities relating to the origination, servicing and securitization of mortgage loans.
Real Estate Development Regulation 
Our real estate development activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance and taxation. In the United States, these include the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder, which we refer to collectively as (the “ADA”). In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer. 
Marketing and Sales Regulation 
Our marketing and sales activities are highly regulated in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition to regulations implementing laws enacted specifically for the timeshare industry, a wide variety of laws and regulations govern our marketing and sales activities, including regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state “Little FTC Acts” and other regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, real estate, title agency or insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security, breach notification, information sharing and telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate and seller of travel laws and other consumer protection laws. 
We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our marketing and sales activities. Changes in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. In addition, many jurisdictions, including many jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and Mexico, require that we file detailed registration or offering statements with regulatory authorities disclosing information regarding our VOIs, such as information concerning the intervals being offered, the project, resort or program to which the intervals relate, applicable timeshare plans, evidence of title, details regarding our business, the purchaser’s rights and obligations with respect to such intervals, and a description of the manner in which we intend to offer and advertise such intervals. 
When we sell VOIs, including non-U.S. jurisdictions such as Mexico and Canada, local law grants the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period following the later of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us. 
In recent years, regulators in many jurisdictions have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring adherence to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and “do not call” legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing, in particular with respect to telemarketing to mobile numbers. While we continue to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, we believe that our exposure to adverse effects from telemarketing legislation and enforcement is mitigated in some instances by the use of permission-based marketing in which we obtain permission to contact prospective purchasers in the future. We have also implemented procedures to comply with federal and state “do not call” regulations including subscribing to the federal do not call registry and certain state “do not call” registries as well as maintaining an internal “do not call” list. 
Lending Regulation 
Our lending and related activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations including those of applicable supervisory agencies such as, in the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and, in the case of our international operations, the Financial Conduct Authority (in the United Kingdom) and other similar or equivalent agencies in other countries and regions in which we operate. These laws and regulations, some of which contain exceptions applicable to the timeshare industry, may include, among others, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and the Credit Practices rules, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. Our lending and related activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, loan servicing, consumer debt collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender or mortgage loan originator licensing and registration and anti-money laundering. 
Resort and Club Management Regulation 
Our resort management activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming and the environment (including climate change). In addition, many jurisdictions in which we manage our resorts have statutory provisions that limit the duration of the initial and renewal terms of our management agreements for HOAs. 
Environmental Matters 
We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements. The costs of complying with these requirements are generally covered by the HOAs that operate the affected resort property and are our responsibility for assets owned by us. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our properties include, and some of our future properties may include, older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have, from time to time, been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management, construction or renovation agreements, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may also be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. We have implemented an on-going operations and maintenance plan at each of our properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Key Agreements with Hilton Worldwide Holdings
On January 3, 2017, in connection with the completion of the spin-off, each of us, Hilton and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. became a separate and independently traded company. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into various agreements with Hilton and Park. Certain of such agreements have been fully performed. However, several agreements continue to govern certain key transactions and arrangements between the parties, in particular between us and Hilton, including our license agreement. The following is a summary of the terms of such agreements. 
Amended and Restated License Agreement
General 
In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a long-term license agreement with Hilton granting us (i) the right to use certain trademarks, including, without limitation, “Hilton Grand Vacations,” “HGV,” and “Hilton Club” (collectively, the “Hilton Marks”), in connection with the current and future operation of a Hilton branded vacation ownership business (the “Licensed Business”), (ii) a license or right to use certain other Hilton-owned intellectual property, including promotional content and access to Hilton’s reservation system and property management software (collectively with the Hilton Marks, the “Hilton IP”), (iii) the right to use Hilton’s loyalty program data and other customer information (“Hilton Data”) to promote the Licensed Business and for other internal business purposes, and (iv) certain other rights. In exchange for these rights, we have agreed to pay Hilton license and other fees, and have agreed to certain restrictions on the operation of our business. In most cases, such rights are exclusive to us, but there are certain exceptions, many of which are described below. While the license agreement permits us to operate certain businesses that do not conflict with Hilton’s business, including non-Hilton branded vacation ownership business, we are not permitted to use any Hilton IP or Hilton Data for such non-Hilton branded portions of our businesses without Hilton’s prior consent.
In March 2021, in connection with entering into a definitive agreement to complete, and in anticipation of consummating, the Diamond Acquisition, we amended and restated the license agreement to account for integrating the Diamond business and properties. In April 2022, we and Hilton further amended the license agreement to define, among other things, (a) a 5-year plan for rebranding and integrating a majority of the Diamond properties into our branded properties, along with minimum room conversion requirements, (b) converting all of the Diamond sales centers into our branded sales centers, and (c) the new licensed marks, “HGV Max” and “Hilton Vacation Club” (which new licensed marks are part of the Hilton Marks). 
Initial Term and Renewal Terms
The initial term of the license agreement will expire on December 31, 2116. After the initial term ends, we may continue to use the Hilton IP and Hilton Data on a non-exclusive basis for a “tail period” of 30 years in connection with our then existing licensed timeshare business and properties, provided that we continue to comply with the terms of the license agreement, including the payment of license and other fees.
Subject to certain exceptions, Hilton is not permitted to compete or use the Hilton IP or Hilton Data in the vacation ownership business (or license others to do so), and we generally have the exclusive right to use the Hilton IP and Hilton Data for our vacation ownership business (subject to certain limited exceptions) until December 31, 2051. Such “exclusivity” and “non-competition” period may be extended for additional 10-year terms if we achieve certain revenue targets in the last year of the exclusivity term or any subsequent renewal term, as applicable, or, if we do not achieve such 
applicable revenue target, by making a payment equal to 5% of the difference between certain revenue actually achieved and the applicable certain revenue target to cover such shortfall. Our ability to elect to make such additional payment to cover any shortfall is subject to a maximum of five payments during the renewal terms. 
License Fee and Other Fees
In exchange for the license and various rights granted to us by Hilton, we pay a license fee of 5% of gross revenues to Hilton quarterly in arrears, as well as specified additional fees. Gross revenues include our gross sales for the initial sale or re-sale of interests in the Licensed Business (subject to certain limited exceptions), property operations revenue, transient rental revenue and other certain revenues earned all with respect to the Licensed Business. 
To account for the integration of the Diamond business into our operations, Hilton agreed to a reduced license fee for the initial five (5) years following the closing of the Diamond Acquisition for gross revenue arising from properties and sales centers that are rebranded and become part of the Licensed Business. The reduced license fee ranges from 2% to 4% of the applicable gross revenue, increasing annually until it reaches 5% during the fifth year and beyond. This reduced license fee structure is contingent upon us achieving certain minimum rebranding milestones related to room conversions with respect to the Diamond business and properties on an annual and cumulative basis over the five-year rebranding plan. If we do not achieve such minimum milestones, we will be subject to an escalated license fee of up to an additional 1%, plus the original fee percentage, of the applicable gross revenue. The escalated license fee is subject to being readjusted to the original fee percentage if we achieve the applicable cumulative rebranding target milestone in subsequent years. If we fail to achieve the final cumulative target by September 30, 2031, Hilton has the election, by notice to us, to prohibit our future offering of HGV Max. 
The license agreement also provides for a reduced license fee, ranging from 0% to 1.5%, over the initial five (5) years following the closing of the Diamond Acquisition for certain property level revenues (such as retail, food and beverage and transient rental at properties operating under the new Hilton Vacations Club brand) related to Diamond properties that are converted into our branded properties and become part of the Licensed Business. 
Pending the rebranding, and so long as they remain non-Hilton licensed branded properties, the Diamond properties are required to be operated as a separate operation in accordance with the license agreement. As discussed above, we are not permitted to use any Hilton IP or Hilton Data for such non-Hilton branded properties, and, accordingly, no license fees are owed to Hilton in connection with revenues associated with such properties and unbranded operations. The license agreement sets forth specific parameters and requirements for any separation operations, including, without limitation, requirements for separate sales centers and personnel for sales related to such non-Hilton branded properties and operating such properties in completely separate physical locations as our Hilton-branded properties, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred license fee expense of $124 million, $80 million, and $51 million, respectively. 
During the term of the license agreement, we are required to participate in Hilton’s loyalty program, currently known as the Hilton Honors program. We can purchase Hilton Honors points at cost for 20 years after the date of the original license agreement, and thereafter at the market rate (with a most favored nation provision, pursuant to which such market rate is no higher than the price paid by strategic partners that purchase a comparable volume of points annually on comparable business terms). For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid Hilton $68 million, $43 million and $41 million, respectively, for Hilton Honors points. 
We have entered into a separate agreement with Hilton that governs the transfer of calls from Hilton to us and other related telemarketing services. Under this agreement, Hilton is required to use its reasonable best efforts to transfer calls to us at a level consistent with past practice prior to the spin-off for the first ten years. Hilton is required to provide the call transfer services at cost for the first 30 years and at market rates thereafter. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid Hilton $12 million, $9 million and $6 million, respectively, for such call transfers.
Brand Standards; Additional Properties or Projects
We are required to comply with the Hilton brand standards applicable to the Licensed Business (which includes any part of the Diamond business that becomes part of the Licensed Business). The conversion of any Diamond property into our branded property is subject to an approval process by Hilton. In addition, the Diamond properties rebranding and conversions are subject to an additional fire and life safety review process by Hilton. Hilton also has the right to enter our vacation ownership properties at any time without notice and additional permission from us in order to verify that we are complying with the license agreement and Hilton’s standards and guidelines.
We are required to obtain Hilton’s consent to develop or operate any additional vacation ownership properties under the Hilton Marks (including on our own undeveloped parcels). 
Deflagging of Properties
Hilton has the right to “deflag” (prevent use of any Hilton IP or Hilton Data at) any property in our Licensed Business in certain circumstances, including if (i) a $10 million or more final judgment is assessed against such property or a foreclosure suit is initiated against such property and not vacated; (ii) an ongoing threat or danger to public health or safety occurs at such property; (iii) such property fails to meet certain quality assurance system performance thresholds; or (iv) such property is not operated in compliance with the license agreement or Hilton’s other standards and agreements, and such breaches are not cured in accordance with the license agreement.
Certain Prohibited Transactions
The license agreement limits our ability to complete or participate in certain corporate transactions. Specifically, unless we obtain Hilton’s prior written consent, we may not be able to: (i) merge with or acquire a Hilton competitor or a vacation ownership business that has entered into an operating agreement with a Hilton competitor; (ii) merge with or acquire a vacation ownership business together with a lodging business; or (iii) be acquired or combined with any entity other than an affiliate. However, we may acquire control of a business that is not a vacation ownership business or a lodging business without Hilton’s consent, but we are required to operate such business as a “separate operation” that does not use the Hilton IP or Hilton Data unless Hilton consents to such use. As previously noted, under the license agreement, we are required to operate the Diamond business as a separate operation, pending the conversion of any Diamond properties to our branded property in accordance with the rebrand plan, which must be approved by Hilton. As previously disclosed, we obtained Hilton's consent under the license agreement for the Diamond Acquisition. 
Without Hilton’s prior consent, we may not assign our rights under the license agreement, except to one of our affiliates as part of an internal reorganization for tax or administrative purposes.
Other Restrictions
The license agreement imposes various other restrictions and requirements that pertain to, without limitation, co-sponsoring credit cards and other payment alternatives, engaging in any lodging business, confidentiality and data security, and strict maintenance of, and compliance with, separation operations that do not use any of Hilton IP or Hilton Data. 
Termination Rights; Damages
Hilton has the right to terminate the license agreement as a whole if, among other things: (i) we file for bankruptcy or cease business operations; (ii) 25 percent or more of our Hilton-branded vacation ownership properties fail certain performance thresholds or the overall customer satisfaction score for all our Hilton-branded vacation ownership properties falls below a certain threshold level, and we do not promptly cure such failures; (iii) we operate the Licensed Business in a way that has a material adverse effect on Hilton; (iv) we fail to pay certain amounts due to Hilton (and in certain cases, do not promptly cure such failures); (v) we contest Hilton’s ownership of the Hilton IP or the Hilton Data; (vi) we merge with, consolidate with or are acquired by a competitor of Hilton; or (vii) we assign the agreement to a non-affiliate without Hilton’s consent.
Under the license agreement, our right to use the Hilton Marks as a trade, corporate, d/b/a or similar name will automatically terminate if: (i) the aggregate number of units of accommodation in our Licensed Business falls below two-thirds of the total number of units of accommodation in our entire vacation ownership business; (ii) we merge with or acquire control of the assets of certain Hilton competitors and we or they use their brands in any business after such acquisition; or (iii) we become an affiliate of another Hilton competitor.
If we breach our obligations under the license agreement, Hilton may, in addition to terminating the license agreement, be entitled to (depending on the nature of the breach): seek injunctive relief and/or monetary damages; suspend our access to and terminate our rights to use Licensed IP and/or Hilton Data (other than the Hilton Marks and certain other content); or terminate our rights to use the Licensed IP (including the Hilton Marks) and Hilton Data at specific locations that are not in compliance with performance standards.
If the license agreement terminates due to our fault before the end of the term, we are required to cease use of the Hilton IP and Hilton Data according to a specified schedule. Hilton has the right to demand liquidated damages based upon its uncollected royalties and fees for the remainder of the term.
We are required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Hilton from and against any claim or liability resulting from: (i) third-party claims based on (a) our breach of the license agreement; (b) the operation of our vacation ownership properties; (c) any use of the Hilton IP or Hilton Data in violation of the license agreement and (d) any use of any content provided to us pursuant to the license agreement; or (ii) claims based on any security breach of our systems and/or unauthorized use or disclosure of Hilton Data.

Distribution Agreement
We entered into a Distribution Agreement with Hilton and Park (the “Distribution Agreement”) in connection with the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement provided for certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of Hilton, HGV and Park and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among Hilton, HGV and Park. In addition, HGV, Hilton and Park agreed that losses related to certain contingent liabilities (and related costs and expenses) that generally are not specifically attributable to any of the separated real estate business, the timeshare business or the retained business of Hilton (“Shared Contingent Liabilities”) will be apportioned among the parties according to fixed percentages of 65%, 26% and 9% for Hilton, Park and HGV, respectively. Costs and expenses of, and indemnification obligations to, third party professional advisors arising out of the foregoing actions also may be subject to these provisions. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton will generally be vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities. To date, there have been no contingent liabilities subject to these provisions since the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company. 
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Distribution Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to HGV’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 4, 2017. 
Tax Matters Agreement 
We have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Hilton and Park (the “Tax Matters Agreement”) that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton, Park and us after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Although binding between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). We and Park each will continue to have several liabilities with Hilton to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Hilton consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we and Park were part of that group. The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which we and Park will bear responsibility, and each party has agreed to indemnify the other two parties against any amounts for which they are not responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off is not tax-free. In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, and certain other relevant provisions of the Code, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party’s stock). The parties share responsibility, in accordance with sharing percentages applicable to Shared Contingent Liabilities, for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a party. In addition, to the extent that any taxes that may be imposed on the Hilton consolidated group for the taxable periods prior to the spin-offs relates to our timeshare business, we would be liable for the full amount under the Tax Matters Agreement.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Tax Matters Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.2 to HGV’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 4, 2017. 
Stockholders Agreement with Apollo
In connection with the Diamond Acquisition, the Company, certain funds affiliated with Apollo, and, for certain limited purposes, Hilton entered into a stockholders agreement on August 2, 2021. For purposes of this section, the term “Apollo Investors” includes any affiliates of Apollo to whom the Apollo Closing Shares (defined below) may be transferred.
Board and Governance Rights
Under the stockholders agreement, the Apollo Investors have the right to designate two individuals (the “Apollo Designees”) to serve on the Company’s board of directors, out of a total of nine directors. If our Board increases its size, for every three additional directors added, the Apollo Investors have the right to appoint the third such director so long as the Apollo Investors (or their affiliates who have executed a joinder agreement to become party to the stockholders 
agreement) retain 23,935,707 of the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that the Apollo Investors received in the Diamond Acquisition (such shares, the “Apollo Closing Shares”).
The Apollo Investors’ right to designate members of the board of directors will step down as their ownership decreases, as follows: (a) ownership below 17,951,780 of the Apollo Closing Shares, one Apollo Designee will be required to resign; and (b) ownership below 11,967,853 of the Apollo Closing Shares, the second Apollo Designee will be required to resign, and the Apollo Investors will no longer be entitled to any representation on our Board. The Apollo Investors are not permitted to “buy back” into the right to designate any Apollo Designees to our Board by acquiring shares of our common stock in the future. 
Transfer Restrictions
The Apollo Investors were subject to a 160-day lock-up period that expired on January 9, 2022. Currently, the Apollo Investors may freely transfer their shares so long as such transfers (i) comply with the volume and manner of sale restrictions in Rule 144, (ii) (a) involve the transfer of less than 5% of our total outstanding stock to any person or group, and (b) are not to certain competitors of HGV or Hilton, known holders of 5% or more of our common stock or known activists, or (iii) are pursuant to an underwritten offering or a broker-facilitated block trade.
Standstill Obligations
The Apollo Investors are subject to certain standstill obligations so long as they (i) own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) have the right to designate at least one director (later of these two dates, the “Standstill Removal Date”). Such standstill obligations include customary prohibitions on certain actions, including acquiring additional stock of the Company, seeking to control or influence our board of directors or our management, and publicly offering to acquire HGV. 
Voting Matters
So long as the Apollo Investors own at least 5,983,927 of the Apollo Closing Shares, they are obligated to vote all of their shares as recommended by our board of directors with respect to routine matters put to a vote of our stockholders. So long as the Apollo Investors hold at least 11,967,853 of the Apollo Closing Shares, the consent of the Apollo Investors is required to (i) amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws in a manner that would require stockholder approval and would materially, disproportionately and adversely affect the rights of the Apollo Investors, or (ii) increase the size of our board of directors to exceed twelve directors; provided, that the Apollo Investors have no such consent right for amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to adopt a “poison pill” approved by our board of directors.
Registration Rights
The Apollo Investors have certain customary registration rights pursuant to which they may request that we register the Apollo Closing Shares on a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to standard carve-outs. In addition, the Apollo Investors have certain “piggyback” rights allowing them to participate in registered public offerings by the Company. The Apollo Investors are responsible for paying all expenses for the registration of their shares.
Pre-emptive Rights
The Apollo Investors have limited preemptive rights on certain future equity issuances by us, subject to customary carve-outs and limitations, so long as the Apollo Investors own at least 11,967,853 shares of the Apollo Closing Shares.
Termination
The stockholders agreement will terminate when the Apollo Investors no longer own at least 5,983,927 of the Apollo Closing Shares; provided, that certain provisions have different termination dates.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the stockholders agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to HGV’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 3, 2021.
