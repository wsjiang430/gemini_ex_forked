Our Business 
The way the world manages energy and water will be one of the defining actions of this century. At Itron, we are committed to creating a more resourceful world—one where energy, water, and city resources are managed safely, securely, and reliably, to help improve day-to-day life and promote the well-being of people around the world. We invent new ways for cities and utilities to work together so they can use data captured by our intelligent endpoints, sensors, and systems to cost-effectively leverage their infrastructure to deliver multiple services and applications on a reliable, intelligent platform capable of serving all their customers.
Itron helps our customers adapt to a rapidly changing world and to address a number of macro trends, including: 
•Infrastructure – such as aging utility infrastructure, grid security, safety, asset monitoring and management, and incorporating the proliferation of distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and storage, into the grid
•Environmental – such as extreme weather, resource scarcity, and demand for sustainability and decarbonization
•Social – such as enhanced customer experience, critical need consumers, privacy, urbanization, population increase, and the management of "big data" and incorporating IIoT technology into their existing operations 
Our solutions include smart networks, software, services, devices, sensors, and data analytics upon a platform that allows our customers to not only address the changing macro trends listed above but also to address pressing industry challenges to better manage and control assets, intelligently benchmark, secure revenue, lower operational costs, improve customer service, develop new business models and revenue streams, improve safety, and enable efficient management of valuable resources. Our comprehensive solutions and data analytics also help our customers address operational issues including increasing demand on resources, non-technical loss, leak detection, environmental and regulatory compliance, integrating renewable and distributed energy sources, and improving operational reliability. 
Itron solutions include technology, software, and services delivered as part of a standalone, one-time purchase or end-to-end solution over multiple years. The portfolio includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing, with and without communications capability; a combination of endpoints and network infrastructure with embedded intelligence that is designed and sold as a complete solution to acquire and transport application-specific data; distribution automation - intelligent communication for the modern grid allowing secure, low-voltage distribution-system automation and control; distributed energy resource management (DERMs) to connect, analyze, and optimize distributed energy resources; and value-added services, software, and products that organize, analyze, and interpret data to gain insights, make decisions, and inform actions. We also offer managed services, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), technical support services, licensed hardware technology, and consulting services.
Industry Drivers
Utility and municipalities are undergoing an evolution in affordability, reliability and sustainability impacting how they operate critical infrastructure, manage scarce resources, address impacts of climate disruption, and interact with their customers. Efficiently managing resources within energy, water, and cities is a top priority globally, as increasing populations and resource consumption along with extreme weather events continue to stress an aging infrastructure. The growing demand for energy, water, and municipal services coupled with the proliferation of renewable energy sources, smart communicating devices, sensors, and multiple data-producing technologies as well as the growing need to manage distributed energy resources is forcing providers to rethink how they operate and service their communities. This evolution comes at a time when utilities and municipalities are challenged by cost constraints, regulatory requirements, environmental concerns, safety, and resource scarcity. Itron provides its customers with solution-based offerings to safely, securely, and reliably optimize their critical infrastructure to improve the efficiency of their services and to better understand their customers and peers with near real-time knowledge of their resource usage. An added benefit of our solutions is that a utility or municipality can empower its customers 
to understand and have control over their resource usage, allowing for better management and conservation of valuable resources.
To address these challenges, utilities and cities are looking to leverage innovations across a networked platform, such as edge (or distributed) intelligence to build and maintain critical infrastructure that can: 
•efficiently and effectively operate energy and water systems that are safe, reliable, and resilient
•reduce the risk and impact of natural disasters
•think for itself, repair itself, and anticipate problems before they occur
•deliver enhanced, more personalized services at lower cost
•accommodate next-generation services through shared infrastructure between utilities and cities/municipalities
•provide actionable insights for asset management
Our Operating Segments
We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under three operating segments: Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and Outcomes. The following is a description of each of the three segments:
Device Solutions – This segment primarily includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing that do not have communications capability embedded for use with our broader Itron systems, i.e., hardware-based products not part of a complete end-to-end solution. Examples from the Device Solutions portfolio include: standard endpoints that are shipped without Itron communications, such as our standard gas, electricity, and water meters for a variety of global markets and adhering to regulations and standards within those markets, as well as our heat and allocation products; communicating meters that are not a part of an Itron end-to-end solution, such as Smart Spec meters; and the implementation and installation of non-communicating devices.
Networked Solutions – This segment primarily includes a combination of communicating devices (e.g., smart meters, modules, endpoints, and sensors), network infrastructure, and associated application software designed and sold as a complete solution for acquiring and transporting robust application-specific data. Networked Solutions includes products and software for the implementation, installation, and management of communicating devices and data networks. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions supported by this segment include automated meter reading (AMR), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distributed energy resource management (DERMs), smart grid and distribution automation, smart street lighting, and an ever-growing set of smart city applications such as traffic management, smart parking, air quality monitoring, electric vehicle charging, customer engagement, digital signage, acoustic (e.g., gunshot) detection, and leak detection and mitigation for both gas and water systems. Our IIoT platform allows all these utility and smart city applications to be run and managed on a single, multi-purpose network.
Outcomes – This segment primarily includes our value-added, enhanced software and services in which we manage, organize, analyze, and interpret raw, anonymized and aggregated data to improve decision making, maximize operational profitability, drive resource efficiency, improve grid analytics, and deliver results for consumers, utilities, and smart cities. Outcomes supports high-value use cases such as data management, grid operations, distributed intelligence, operations management, gas distribution and safety, water operations management, revenue assurance, DERMs, energy forecasting, consumer engagement, smart payment, and fleet energy resource management. Utilities leverage these outcomes to capitalize on the power of networks and devices, empower their workforce, maximize their operations and enhance the customer experience. The revenues from these offerings are primarily recurring in nature and would include any direct management of Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and other products on behalf of our end customers.
Bookings and Backlog of Orders
Bookings for a reported period represent customer contracts and purchase orders received during the period for hardware, software, and services that have met certain conditions, such as regulatory and/or contractual approval. Total backlog represents committed but undelivered products and services for contracts and purchase orders at period-end. Twelve-month backlog represents the portion of total backlog that reflects our understanding of customer's desired deployment over the next 12 months. The actual revenue recognized and timing of revenue earned from backlog may vary based on actual currency rates at the time of shipment, supply constraints, and adjusted customer project timing. Backlog is not a complete measure of our future revenues as we also receive significant book-and-ship orders, as well as frame contracts. Bookings and backlog may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of large project awards. In addition, annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling due to the long-term nature of the contracts. Certain of our customers have the right to cancel contracts, but we do not have a history of any significant cancellations. Beginning total backlog, plus bookings, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to miscellaneous contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Total bookings and backlog include certain contracts with a termination for convenience clause, which will not agree to the total transaction 
price allocated to the remaining performance obligations disclosed in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17: Revenues.

Year Ended | Total Bookings | | Total Backlog | | 12-Month Backlog
In millions | | | | | 
December 31, 2022 | $ | 2,505 | | | $ | 4,619 | | $ | 2,052
December 31, 2021 | 2,755 | | | 4,017 | | | 1,539
December 31, 2020 | 2,213 | | | 3,259 | | | 1,204

Our total backlog, as of December 31, 2021, included $64.7 million of backlog related to the sale of certain Gas product lines from our Device Solutions manufacturing and business operations in Europe and North America to Dresser Utility Solutions (Dresser). At transaction close on February 28, 2022, $55.7 million of this backlog was transferred to Dresser. For more information on the transaction refer to Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18: Sale of Businesses.
Sales and Distribution
We use a combination of direct and indirect sales channels to access our customers. A direct sales force is utilized for our larger customers, with which we have long-established relationships. This direct sales force is focused on solution selling, solving problems and business challenges, and delivering valuable outcomes to our utility and smart city customers. For smaller utilities and most municipalities, we typically use an indirect sales channel that extends the reach of Itron's solutions by empowering trusted partners with the right tools, training, and technology to grow their business, deliver results, and help these customers better manage energy and water. These channels consist of distributors, agents, partners, and meter manufacturer representatives.
No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Our 10 largest customers in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, accounted for approximately 32%, 25%, and 33% of total revenues.
Manufacturing
Our products require a wide variety of components and materials, which are subject to price and supply fluctuations. We enter into typical contracts in the ordinary course of business, which can include purchase orders for specific quantities based on market prices, as well as open-ended agreements that provide for estimated quantities over an extended shipment period, typically up to one year at an established unit cost. Although we have multiple sources of supply for many of our material requirements, certain components and raw materials are supplied by limited or sole-source vendors, and our ability to perform certain contracts depends on the availability of these materials. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for further discussion related to manufacturing and supply risks.
Our manufacturing facilities are located throughout the world, an overview of which is presented in Item 2: Properties. While we manufacture and assemble a portion of our products, we outsource the manufacturing of many products and sub-assemblies to various manufacturing partners and strive to create an efficient and cost-effective structure. This approach allows us to reduce the costs related to our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing customer demand. These manufacturing partners assemble our sub-assemblies and products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish and procure components and assemble our products based on demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions, as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Partners
In connection with delivering solutions and systems to our customers, we frequently partner with third-party vendors to provide hardware, software, or services, e.g., meter installation and communication network equipment and infrastructure. Due to the interoperable, open-standards based nature of our platform, we have also cultivated a highly diverse and growing ecosystem of partners and third-party developers who can create complementary solutions for our customers that run on the same network and within the same platform framework.
Our ability to perform on our contractual obligations with our customers is dependent on these partners meeting their obligations to us. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for further discussion related to third-party vendors and strategic partners.
Research and Development
Our research and development is focused on both improving existing technology and developing innovative new technology for critical infrastructure in electricity, natural gas, water, heat, smart city, and DERMs verticals. This includes endpoints, sensing and control devices, data collection software, communication technologies, data warehousing, software applications, and the IIoT. We invested approximately $185 million, $197 million, and $194 million in research and development in 2022, 2021 and 2020, which represented 10% of total revenues for 2022 and 2021 and 9% of total revenues for 2020. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for further discussion related to costs of developing competitive products and services.

Intellectual Property
Our patents and patent applications cover a range of technologies that relate to standard metering, smart metering solutions and technology, meter data management software, knowledge application solutions, and IIoT. We also rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to protect our products and technologies. Disputes over the ownership, registration, and enforcement of intellectual property rights arise in the ordinary course of our business. While we believe patents and trademarks are important to our operations and, in aggregate, constitute valuable assets, no single patent or trademark, or group of patents or trademarks, is critical to the success of our business. We license some of our technology to other companies, some of which are our competitors.
Governmental Regulations
In the ordinary course of our business, we are impacted by many governmental regulations, including environmental regulations. We believe that we are materially in compliance with all federal, state, and local governmental laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the operation of our business. There are no known regulations pending that will have a substantial adverse impact on our business, revenue, earnings, or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be altered.
