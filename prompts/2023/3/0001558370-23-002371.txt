BUSINESS
Our Business
TTEC Holdings, Inc. (“TTEC”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”; pronounced “T-TEC”) is a leading global customer experience (“CX”) as a service (“CXaaS”) partner for many of the world’s most iconic companies, disruptive hypergrowth brands, and large public sector agencies. TTEC designs, builds, orchestrates, and delivers seamless digitally-enabled customer experiences that increase brand value, customer loyalty, revenue, and profitability through personalized, outcome-based interactions. We help clients improve their customer satisfaction while lowering their total cost to serve by combining innovative digital solutions with service capabilities that deliver a frictionless CX across numerous real-time digital and live interaction channels and different phases of the customer lifecycle.
The Company operates and reports its financial results of operations through two business segments: TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage.

TTEC Digital designs, builds, and operates robust digital experiences for clients and their customers through the contextual integration and orchestration of customer relationship management (“CRM”), data, analytics, CXaaS technology, and intelligent automation to ensure high-quality, scalable CX outcomes.

● | TTEC Engage provides the digitally enabled CX managed services to support our clients’ end-to-end customer interaction delivery at scale.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage strategically come together under our unified offering, Humanify® CXaaS, which drives measurable customer results for clients through the delivery of personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences. Our Humanify® cloud platform provides a fully integrated ecosystem of CX offerings, including messaging, AI, machine learning, robotic process automation, analytics, cybersecurity, CRM, knowledge management, journey orchestration, and traditional voice solutions. Our end-to-end CXaaS platform differentiates us from competitors by combining design, strategic consulting, technology, data analytics, process optimization, system integration, and operational excellence along with our decades of industry know-how. This unified offering is value-oriented, outcome-based and delivered to large enterprises, hypergrowth companies and public sector agencies on a global scale.
During 2022, the TTEC global operating platform delivered onshore, nearshore and offshore services in 21 countries on six continents -- the United States, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom – with the help of 69,400 consultants, technologists, and CX professionals.
Our revenue for fiscal 2022 was $2.444 billion, approximately $472 million, or 19%, which came from our TTEC Digital segment and $1.972 billion, or 81%, which came from our TTEC Engage segment. 
To improve our competitive position in a rapidly changing market and to lead our clients with emerging CX methodologies, we continue to invest in innovation and service offerings for both mainstream and high-growth disruptive businesses, diversifying and strengthening our core customer care services with technology-enabled, outcomes-focused services, data analytics, insights, and consulting.

We also invest to broaden our product and service capabilities, increase our global client base and industry expertise, tailor our geographic footprint to the needs of our clients, and further scale our end-to-end integrated solutions platform. To this end we were highly acquisitive in the last several years, including our acquisition in April 2022 of certain public sector assets of Faneuil, Inc. that included healthcare exchange and transportation services contracts. The acquisition expanded our capabilities in the growing public sector market by adding the building and operating of technology-enabled citizen engagement solutions to our offerings. We also completed an acquisition early in the second quarter of 2021 of a provider of Genesys and Microsoft cloud contact center services, which followed an acquisition in the second half of 2020 of a preferred Amazon Connect cloud contact center service and implementation provider.
We have extensive expertise in the healthcare, automotive, national/federal and state and local government, financial services, communications, technology, travel and logistics, media and entertainment, e-tail/retail, and transportation industries. We serve more than 775 diverse clients globally, including many of the world’s iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, public sector agencies, and disruptive hypergrowth companies.
Our Industry – Key Emerging Themes

● | Accelerated Digital and Virtual Transformation – Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading organizations were already transforming to a more digitized, virtualized future. The pandemic and related impacts on access to products and services, and how organizations manage their customer interactions, exposed significant customer interaction technology and delivery deficiencies for many organizations across the world that were not digitized or agile enough to adequately support their customers. Organizations’ front-line operations and customer support infrastructure were too brick-and-mortar focused with limited non-voice digital customer interaction alternatives. Organizations are recognizing the growing importance of increased virtual delivery solutions and expanded and enhanced digital omnichannel capabilities. This development is expected to create accelerated demand for our demonstrated suite of CX product and service offerings to enable and support this transformation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) Revolution - The DTC revolution has created a new generation of disruptive brands with few barriers to entry. These emerging brands thrive on emotional connection and authentic customer relationships relying on trusted influencers and personalized service to win the hearts and minds of a growing customer base, one that requires an on-demand, curated buying experience. We believe DTC can enhance the value we provide to our clients as we design, build and operate our clients’ digital customer experience.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evolution of Customer Behavior and CX Imperative - Yesterday's customer service experience is being replaced by today's direct experience, where brands deliver a personalized end-to-end journey. As customers become more connected and share their experiences across a variety of social channels, the quality of the experience has a greater impact on brand loyalty and business performance. Customers are increasingly shaping their attitudes, behaviors, and willingness to recommend or stay with a brand based on the totality of their experience, including not only the superiority of the product or service, but also the quality of their ongoing service and support interactions. Given the strong correlation between high customer satisfaction and improved profitability, companies are increasingly focused on selecting partners who can deliver an integrated, insights-driven strategy, service, and technology solution that increases the lifetime value of a customer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CX Technology is Migrating to the Cloud - Cloud investment is expected to continue to grow significantly. The adoption of cloud technology to deliver omnichannel and other customer experience technology solutions is still in its infancy. Our clients are embracing cloud-based CX technology solutions in a manner similar to how they seek cost-effective architecture and rapid deployment across other parts of their operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Enterprises are Consolidating Partners - Companies are consolidating their customer engagement wallet with a few select partners who can deliver measurable business outcomes by offering an integrated, technology-enabled solution. Companies will continue to consolidate their business partner relationships, favoring companies like TTEC that have demonstrated expertise in increasing brand value by delivering holistic, integrated customer-centric solutions spanning the entire customer experience journey, instead of inefficiently linking together a series of multiple point solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delivery Shifting from Brick-and-Mortar to Work From Home – COVID-19 accelerated the shift of customer experience delivery from brick-and-mortar to work from home. While a portion of work from home delivery has shifted back to brick-and-mortar post-pandemic, we expect a high portion of delivery will remain in work from home locations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
We aim to grow our revenue and profitability by focusing on our core customer engagement operational capabilities, linking them to higher margin, insights and technology-enabled platforms and managed services to drive a superior experience for our clients’ customers. To that end we continually strive to:

● | Build deeper, more strategic relationships with existing global clients to drive enduring, transformational change within their organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue new clients who lead their respective industries and who are committed to value driven customer engagement as a differentiator;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in our global sales and marketing leadership team at both the segment level to improve collaboration and speed-to-market, and consultative sales level to deliver more integrated, strategic, and transformational solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand into new geographic markets that give us access to new customers, partners, and delivery center capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Execute strategic acquisitions that further complement and expand our integrated solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in technology-enabled platforms and innovation through technology advancements, broader and globally protected intellectual property, and process optimization; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Work within our technology partner ecosystem to deliver best-in-class solutions with expanding intellectual property through value-add applications, integrations, services, and solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
TTEC is an industry leader in CX by leveraging the following competitive strengths:

● | Humanify® Technology Platform and Insights-Driven Technology Solutions - Innovation has been a priority since our inception 40 years ago. Our dedication and investment in transforming our business has differentiated our solutions portfolio and increased the value we deliver to our clients across the CX continuum. Our Humanify® Technology Platform delivers an ecosystem of integrated CX applications, including omnichannel contact center platforms, the largest CRMs and enterprise resource planning products, as well as innovative technology solutions that we fully integrate into our clients' broader technology systems. The platform is based on secure, scalable public and private data centers, in both pure cloud, on premise, and hybrid environments. This architecture enables us to centralize and standardize our global delivery capabilities, resulting in scalability and improved quality of delivery for our clients, as well as lowering capital and information technology operating costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fundamental to our platforms is our network of global data centers, which provide an integrated suite of voice and data routing, workforce management, quality monitoring, business analytics, storage, and infrastructure security and fault-tolerance capabilities, enabling seamless operations from locations around the globe. This ‘hub and spoke model’ enables us to provide services at a competitive cost while delivering scalability, reliability, regulatory compliance, and asset utilization across the full suite of our service offerings. It also provides effective redundancy for a timely response to system interruptions and outages due to natural disasters, grid downtime, and other conditions outside of our control. Importantly, this broad-based platform has accelerated our time to market foundation for new, innovative offerings such as TTEC's cloud based Humanify® Operations/Insights Platform, Humanify® @Home for remote omnichannel agents, and our suite of human capital solutions.
Further, our Humanify® Technology Platforms leverage reference architectures for multiple solutions whether we are operating the platforms and the services, implementing customized platforms for clients, or providing advanced managed services and continuous and automated development environments. They also provide clients with compliant solutions for regional (e.g., the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”)), industry (e.g., the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI”), or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPPA”)), or client specific standards (e.g., FedRamp or FISMA).

These capabilities are the culmination of four decades of experience in managing a large, global workforce combined with the latest technology, innovation and strategies in the field of human capital management. This capability has enabled us to deliver a scalable and flexible workforce that is highly engaged in achieving and exceeding our clients' expectations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Robust Technology Partner Ecosystem - Our strategic alliances with important digital channel partners enable our clients to deliver high-impact, personalized customer experiences more efficiently. We go to market with our Humanify® cloud offering with our key strategic partners including Cisco, LivePerson, Pega, Amazon, Microsoft, and Genesys to continue to fuel AI-powered digital transformation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Globally Deployed Operating Best Practices - Globally deployed operating best practices help us deliver a consistent, scalable, high-quality experience to our clients' customers from any of our 73 global customer delivery centers and geographically disbursed work from home associate base. Standardized processes include our approach to attracting, screening, hiring, training, scheduling, evaluating, coaching, and maximizing associate performance to meet our clients' needs. We also provide real-time reporting and analytics on performance across the globe to help ensure transparency and consistency of delivery. This information provides valuable insight into what is driving customer inquiries, enabling us to proactively recommend process changes that optimize the customer experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clients
We develop long-term relationships with clients globally, including many of the worlds’ iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, public sector agencies, and hypergrowth companies. These organizations are in customer intensive industries or sectors, whose complexities and customer focus require a partner that can quickly design and build integrated technology and data-enabled services, often on a global scale. In 2022, our top five and 10 clients represented 35% and 47% of total revenue, respectively. 
In several of our offerings across TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage, we enter into long-term relationships that provide us with a more predictable recurring revenue stream. In our TTEC Digital segment, our CX cloud and managed services technology solution contracts have an average three-year term with penalties in the case a client terminates for convenience. In our TTEC Engage segment, most of our contracts can be terminated for convenience by either party, but our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from 16 to 23 years including multiple programs and contract renewals for most of these clients. In 2022, we had a 97% revenue retention rate for the TTEC Engage segment, versus 109% in 2021.
Certain of our communications clients provide us with telecommunication services through arm’s length negotiated transactions. These clients currently represent approximately 5% of our total annual revenue. Expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than 1% of our total operating costs.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Through the period ended December 31, 2022 the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our operational or financial results. As of December 31, 2022 we have no continuing COVID-19 related surge work. Our clients continue to reposition their work in the post-pandemic environment, leveraging new ways of working, and evolving the use of technology. Based on currently available information, we cannot accurately predict the post-pandemic changes to our clients’ businesses and their effect on the magnitude and timing of our clients’ buying decisions. Further, while to date we have been successful in managing service delivery from a mix of delivery centers and highly disbursed employee population working remotely, certain seasonal weather cycles and their potential impacts on power grid and internet availability for our employees working from home may impact our delivery capability with little notice, thus potentially impacting our results of operations in the future. As the needs of the business and our client requests now require us to return some of our employees who have been working remotely to on-site work in our delivery centers, some employees may be reluctant to return to traditional work on-sites and it may have impacts on our ability to staff projects and deliver services.

Competition
We are a leading global customer experience technology and services partner for many of the world’s most iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, public sector agencies, and hypergrowth companies. Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation, integrated solutions, digital and virtual delivery capabilities, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, brand recognition, and financial strength.
Our strategy in maintaining market leadership is to invest, innovate, and provide integrated value-driven services, all centered around customer engagement management. Today, we are executing on a more expansive, holistic strategy by transforming our business into higher-value offerings through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. As we execute, we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and entering new markets that introduce us to an expanded competitive landscape.
In our TTEC Digital segment, we primarily compete with smaller pure-play technology and service providers and divisions of multinational companies, including Five9, InContact, Twilio, EPAM, Endava, Globant, Accenture, Cognizant, and Infosys, among others.
In our TTEC Engage segment, we primarily compete with in-house customer management operations as well as other companies that provide customer care services including: Teleperformance, Telus International, Concentrix, TaskUs, Intouch CX, Webhelp, Accenture, Genpact, and Exl, among others.
Regulations Relevant to Our Business
TTEC is subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations, permitting and licensing regimes (collectively, “Regulations”). These Regulations often change and require TTEC to devote considerable resources and make investments to stay in consistent compliance. The narrative that follows summarizes some of the more important Regulations that impact our business; it is not intended as an all-inclusive list. In jurisdictions where we do business, TTEC has processes in place to monitor regulatory requirements and take reasonable steps to assure compliance. 
Data Privacy. We are subject to data protection and privacy regulations in many of the countries where we operate, including the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Protection Act ("CCPA") and other similar U.S. state-level data protection legislation, and the Philippine Data Privacy Act (“Republic Act No. 10173”). Certain of our systems, that support clients with special regulatory requirements, also require compliance with Health Information Trust Alliance (“HITRUST”) requirements and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) regulations for clients in the healthcare industry; the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) for financial services clients and other clients where we have access to their customers’ payment card information; Federal Information Security Management Act GSA (“FISMA”) and Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRamp”) requirements for U.S. federal government clients; and other similar requirements. 
TTEC maintains a cyber security and data privacy program designed to protect our clients’, their customers’, and our employees’ confidential personal and sensitive information. We have invested in our cyber security capabilities to identify, detect, respond to and recover from cyber threats and attacks. These investments help us reduce our vulnerabilities to cyber incidents and minimize their impacts on our operations. They also support compliance with our contractual obligations and the laws and regulations governing our activities. We engage independent auditors to conduct general controls and business process (SOC1 and SOC2) assessments for technology solutions we use in our banking, financial services, and insurance (“BFSI”) and healthcare verticals. We also engage third parties to conduct vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of our technology environments. See "Risk Factors — Uncertainty and inconsistency in privacy and data protection laws relevant to our business, failure to comply with contractual obligations related to privacy, and high cost of compliance may impact our ability to deliver services and our results of operations.”

Work From Home Regulations. The transition to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to new Regulations specific to work from home, which vary among jurisdictions and range from requirements to reimburse costs associated with remote work, to special health and safety mandates, and special government reporting requirements. To comply with these Regulations, TTEC updated its payroll practices and adopted new ways of working, including the use of virtual private networks to access service delivery applications, and remote monitoring and coaching of employees. As we were not always able to replicate in the work from home environment the physical controls we have in place at our delivery centers, we agreed with our clients to implement certain additional controls. Employees that work from home are required to attest to their understanding and compliance with these controls and with TTEC’s enhanced remote work policy that is designed to address new Regulations and the modified contractual requirements. TTEC works diligently with specialists to stay current on the rapidly changing regulatory environment, but the distributed nature of remote service delivery continues to represent heightened risks of security threats and compliance challenges and there can be no assurance that these risks can be fully contained. See "Risk Factors — Our client services delivered by employees working from home are now a standard and this change in the operating model may subject us to new untested risks.”
Other Regulations. TTEC is a labor-intensive business that is subject to complex labor and employment laws established by the U.S. Department of Labor, state and local regulatory bodies, and similar regulators in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. These Regulations govern working conditions, paid time off, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices. 
Our public sector work is secured and delivered in compliance with various jurisdiction-specific government procurement regulations, like the Federal Acquisition Regulations (known as “FAR”) and government agency specific supplemental regulations that we comply with when we bid and deliver work for the U.S. federal government.
Our global operations are subject to various domestic and foreign anti-corruption mandates, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions where we do business. As a U.S. company operating through non-U.S. subsidiaries, TTEC is subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing, cross-border tax Regulations, immigration and customs Regulations that prescribe how funds, goods, and people traverse between TTEC and our foreign subsidiaries. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our International Operations.”
Work we do for some of our clients is subject to special licensing requirements, e.g., insurance producer and gaming licenses. The granting of these licenses can be discretionary on the part of regulatory authorities. As part of the licensing requirements, we may also be subject to extensive and expensive cybersecurity regulations or subject to heightened disclosure requirements that impact our companies or our executives. See, “Risk Factors -- Our financial results may be impacted by changes in laws/regulations and our failure to comply with laws/regulations relevant to our business.”
We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with relevant Regulations; but our compliance with Regulations may cause us to make additional capital and operational expenditures, the cost of which we may not always be able to pass to our clients through our pricing structures, and such additional investments could be material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See "Risk Factors — Our results of operations may be impacted by changes in laws, our failure to comply with laws and regulations relevant to our business.”
Research, Innovation, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
We recognize the value of innovation in our business and are committed to developing leading-edge technologies and proprietary solutions. Research and innovation have been a major factor in our success and we believe that they will continue to contribute to our growth in the future. We use our investment in research and development to create, commercialize, and deploy innovative business strategies and high-value technology solutions.

We deliver value to our clients through, and our success in part depends on, certain proprietary technologies and methodologies. We leverage U.S. and foreign patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws as well as confidentiality, proprietary information, non-disclosure agreements, and key staff non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary technology.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 11 patent applications pending; and also hold 96 U.S. and non-U.S. patents in 9 jurisdictions that we leverage in our operations and as marketplace differentiation for our service offerings. Our trade name, logos, and names of our proprietary solution offerings are protected by their historic use and, in addition, by trademarks and service marks registered in 32 jurisdictions.
Human Capital Resources
Headcount Information: As of December 31, 2022, TTEC had 69,400 employees, approximately 2,800 of whom are CX professionals serving TTEC Digital clients and approximately 66,600 of whom serve TTEC Engage clients. Approximately 47% of our employees are based in the Asia-Pacific region, 42% in North America (with 40% in the United States), 7% in Central and South America, and 4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.
Development and Training:  Our 2022 Human Experience (HX) people strategy is focused on the attraction, development and retention of our employees through meaningful engagement and purposeful development. To support advancement of our employees and prepare them for demands of rapidly changing workplace and client requirements we offer career development focused programs, technologies, and resources. In 2022 we made significant investments in learning technologies and courseware, including the expansion of capabilities within our robust talent management platform, TTEC Talenttm, that provides a streamlined end-to-end career management experience. Expansion included the implementation of a mobile app that provides all employees access to TTEC Talenttm at any time from any device. TTEC Talenttm houses a library of more than 10,000 courses that cover topics on general business acumen ranging from business operations, professionalism, leadership, ethics, finance, negotiations, and project management to subject-matter specific professional and technical curriculum. We also expanded our courseware offerings in informational Technology and Digital Transformation through partnerships with specialty courseware vendors. In direct support of our Digital segment, we launched the Digital University program, a scalable 60-90 day learning journey providing talent readiness needed to enter the organization and best serve our clients. Our TTEC development programs help identify top performers, improve employee performance, engagement, and retention, and create promotion-from-within opportunities in the Company with 71% of our open positions filled by internal candidates in 2022.
Our performance management philosophy is a comprehensive strategy aligned to our Company’s business priorities, requiring regular coaching sessions and performance evaluations that aim at building a high-performance culture. Managers and employees can collaborate to create goals, assess goal completion, identify developmental opportunities and how values driven behavior contributes to results. Feedback can be requested or provided at any time on goal progress, values behavior, recognition, or development, and in 2022 through TTEC Talenttm 95% of eligible employees completed check-ins with their manager focused on goals, priorities, and personal development on a quarterly basis.
Our 2022 comprehensive executive talent development strategy can be easily customized and launched by segment and/or department and enables leaders and teams to plan and build talent capability. Talent planning and development for executive roles is accomplished through a talent review and succession planning process which includes consulting, training, data analytics, calibration, and development recommendations. We evaluate all mid-level managers and above roles, determine top talent and successors and invest in their development to meet our growth goals. Executive development programs created and launched in 2022 include an Executive Learning Center of Excellence, a one-stop-shop for executive development resources and our Executive Leadership Academy, a leadership development program for high potential Directors and above that includes 360 assessments, formal and informal learning, facilitator and faculty-led sessions, coaching and mentoring, and applied learning.

In 2022, TTEC launched the second cohort of employees as part of our Leadership Development Internship (“LDI”). The LDI program, originally launched in 2021, is designed to identify and attract new talent and prepare them for success within our organization. Each year the program recruits individuals finishing up their undergraduate degrees or early in their career with diverse backgrounds in various fields relevant to TTEC ranging from technology to humanities. These individuals are paired into departments that align with their interests and career goals and spend a summer working in those areas and learning all about our business. We also launched our first Leadership Development Internship cohort in India, and at the end of the year made plans to begin this program in Mexico.
Diversity Equity & Inclusion (DEI): TTEC believes that our differences are one of our greatest strengths; and that diversity of our employees enables us to innovate how we serve our clients and their diverse customers on six continents. Our DEI Council, comprised of senior leaders from different business segments a wide range of ethnicities, nationalities, genders, and sexual orientations, governs TTEC DEI education and advancement initiatives; provides resources for our employees to achieve their full potential; and oversees our employee resource groups (“ERGs”) dedicated to empowerment and opportunities to member of special interest groups including:

● | Champions of Color, a group that supports employees of Black or of African descent;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Women In Leadership group that supports a global community of TTEC women and allies, with a subset group focused on Women in Tech;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MINDS, the group that highlights the strengths of individual neurodiversity; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PRISM, the group that supports and celebrates employees who identify as LGBTQIA+ and their allies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our DEI Council is a critical driver in fostering organizational change, establishing a dedicated focus on DEI priorities and how they align with the Company’s business strategy and its Environmental Social Governance (“ESG”) objectives. The Council, together with TTEC executive leadership team, hold the organization accountable to increase awareness and education and provide leadership opportunities for underrepresented employees so they can reach their full potential and delivery on the Company’s promise to Bringing Humanity to BusinessTM. These focused initiatives paid dividend when the results of our 2022 Employee Experience (EX25) survey told us that 89% of our employees feel they can be themselves at work and succeed to their full potential. As of December 31, 2022, 61% of the Company’s global workforce and 56% of our employees in supervisory roles were female; while 57% of our U.S. workforce and 41% of our employees in supervisory roles were people of color.
Competitive Pay/Benefits and Pay-for-Performance Philosophy:  Our pay-for-performance philosophy aligns our compensation programs with TTEC’s performance and reflects our commitment to reward short and long-term performance that aligns with and drives long-term stockholder value. TTEC compensation programs are designed to provide appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve desired outcomes for our clients and our shareholders. Further, TTEC provides employees with a comprehensive benefits program that includes health insurance and important wellness programs, including mental health initiatives, as well as other programs that support employees’ physical, emotional, and financial health.
Workplace Safety:  The health and safety of our employees is one of our top priorities. TTEC’s success depends on protecting our employees, visitors, clients and facilities, and our goal is to provide everyone that works for us and with us, a safe and healthy work environment. TTEC employees are required to complete health and safety training when they join the Company and are encouraged to report any concerns they have about health and safety in their work environment. 
In 2022 the majority of our global workforce remained working in a remote environment. For employees that worked in a bricks and mortar setting, we continued to follow diligent COVID protocols to ensure employee safety. These safety protocols included increased cleaning frequency, additional signage, workstation reconfiguration for social distancing, personal protective equipment, contact tracing, shuttle services, and automated health attestations.

Retention and Turnover: Employee experience and retention remain a top priority for TTEC and are a key driver of financial results of our operations. Our turnover reduction efforts focus on market pay, trained management teams, development programs, career mobility, communication and the work environment and company culture that make an employee feel engaged, rewarded, appreciated, informed, and fulfilled in the organization. In 2022, we saw great improvement in employee retention due to diligent focus on these efforts.
Employee Engagement: We continuously assess employee engagement by gathering employees’ sentiment and in 2022 we launched all-new methodologies to understand employee sentiment throughout the year and annually. These new surveys allow us to measure employee engagement as well as four other key performance indicators of employee experience (Well-being, Inclusion, Experience Versus Expectations, and Intent to Stay). In 2022, about 44,000 of our employees responded to our annual engagement survey alone. Based on these surveys our employee engagement ratings exceed best-in-class engagement scores.
