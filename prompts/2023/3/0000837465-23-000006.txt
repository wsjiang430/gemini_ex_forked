Item 1.    Business Overview
Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (formerly Callaway Golf Company), together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Topgolf Callaway Brands”), is a leading modern golf and active lifestyle company that provides world-class golf entertainment experiences, designs and manufactures premium golf equipment, and sells golf and active lifestyle apparel and other accessories through its family of brand names which include Topgolf, Callaway Golf, Odyssey, TravisMathew, Jack Wolfskin, OGIO and Toptracer.
The Company was incorporated in California in 1982 under its previous name, “Callaway Golf Company,” with a primary focus on the design, manufacture and sale of high-quality golf clubs and golf balls. In 1992, the Company became a publicly-traded corporation on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “ELY” and in 1999, the Company reincorporated in the State of Delaware. In 2017, the Company expanded its business into active lifestyle apparel and accessories with its acquisitions of OGIO, a leading manufacturer of high-quality bags and accessories, and TravisMathew, a manufacturer of premium golf and active lifestyle apparel and accessories. In 2019, the Company acquired Jack Wolfskin, and in 2021, the Company completed a merger with Topgolf, a leading technology-enabled golf entertainment business comprised of state-of-the-art golf and entertainment venues, proprietary Toptracer ball-tracking technology, and an innovative media and content creation platform. These transactions have transformed the Company into a leading modern golf, lifestyle and entertainment company whose products, services and brands are now sold across multiple channels in the United States and internationally in over 120 countries. 
On September 6, 2022, the Company changed its corporate name from Callaway Golf Company to Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp., and on September 7, 2022, changed its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from “ELY” to “MODG.” The changes to the corporate name and ticker symbol did not have any impact on the Company’s legal entity structure, financial statements or previously reported financial information.
GROWTH AND OVERALL STRATEGY
The Company believes it is well-positioned for long-term growth given its diversified portfolio and unmatched consumer scale and reach within the growing modern golf ecosystem, which has increased meaningfully in recent years due in large part to the growth of off-course golf, which is expected to continue to grow, driven in part by Topgolf’s continued new venue development. Building off strong industry fundamentals, Topgolf Callaway Brands’ path to long-term growth is anchored on five key initiatives which include the following: executing on Topgolf’s domestic and international expansion strategy and growth of same-venue-sales; maintaining a leadership position in golf equipment technology and innovation; maintaining sustainable brand momentum and increasing direct-to-consumer presence in the active lifestyle segment; leveraging the Company’s global scale and integrated supply chain; and capitalizing on digital revenue opportunities and cross-segment cost synergies. By executing on its long-term strategy to achieve each of these initiatives, the Company believes it can create long-term value for shareholders.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND PRODUCTS
The Company manages its global business operations through its operating and reportable business segments. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had three reportable operating business segments: Topgolf, Golf Equipment and Active Lifestyle.
During the second quarter of 2022, the Company changed the name of its “Apparel, Gear, and Other” operating segment to “Active Lifestyle”. The segment name change had no impact on the composition of the Company’s segments or on previously reported financial position, results of operations, cash flow or segment operating results.
TOPGOLF
Topgolf is a leading technology-enabled golf entertainment business with an innovative platform of products and services which are comprised of its state-of-the-art open-air golf and entertainment venues, its largest line of business, as well as its revolutionary proprietary Toptracer ball-tracking technology and digital media platform.
Venues
The Topgolf venues business is comprised of Company-owned and operated venues located within the United States and Company-operated and franchised venues located outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2022, Topgolf had 77 Company-operated venues in the United States, four Company-operated venues in the United Kingdom and five franchised venues in Australia, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Germany. Over the next several years, the Company’s focus is to maintain a strong pipeline of new venue openings, both domestically and internationally, through increasing the number of Company-owned and operated venues, as well as through international franchise partners.
Design and Development
Topgolf tailors the design of its venues to thrive in varying climates, conditions and market sizes. The location of each of Topgolf’s venues is carefully selected through a disciplined, data-driven site selection process, led by an experienced real estate team and augmented by a nationwide broker network. A typical venue takes between 10 and 15 months to build, though build times vary based on the size and complexity of the model, existing site conditions, the season and other factors. Topgolf primarily uses the services of design/build contractors for the construction of its venues, and generally estimates the gross development cost to build a venue to be between $10 million and $55 million depending on the size and location of the facility. Topgolf typically seeks to finance the construction of its venues through third-party developers or real estate financing partners. While Topgolf may still be required to fund a portion of venue development costs, its financing partners will purchase or lease the land and fund a majority of venue development costs during and after construction. Once construction is completed, Topgolf leases the venue and underlying land back from the financing partner, or in cases where Topgolf does not choose to finance venue construction through one of its financing partners, Topgolf will fund 100% of venue development costs.
Technology and game development for Topgolf is supported by teams located in offices and studios in Dallas, Texas, San Francisco, California and Stockholm, Sweden. These teams are comprised of front-end and back-end engineers including software, network, structural, radio frequency, electrical, mechanical, machine learning, visual recognition, system test, computer vision scientists and data analysis, user experience and industrial design engineers, and mobile app developers. Topgolf utilizes a number of proprietary, industry standard and third-party management information systems in its business and relies on its own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate games and to maintain and provide analytical data. 
Venue Management and Operations
Domestic venue operations are supported by a multi-disciplined operations team which is responsible for a number of areas, including pre-opening activities (including employee recruitment, selection and training), culinary development, event sales support, technology services, supply chain support for food, beverages and equipment, marketing, and ongoing training and development for associates. Maintaining a high degree of quality in the venues depends in part on Topgolf’s ability to acquire food and beverage ingredients, venue hardware, golf equipment and/or other supplies that meet Topgolf’s high standards from reliable suppliers. Topgolf uses a third-party verification company to ensure that all vendors meet specified United States guidelines and regulations. For produce, Topgolf uses a third-party vendor that regulates a network of produce distributors nationwide. Topgolf has supply agreements in place with manufacturers in Taiwan and China to produce the radio-frequency identification (“RFID”)-enabled golf equipment, which is specially designed for venue use during game play. Topgolf also utilizes the Company’s engineers to support the development of golf equipment, including golf balls. Bay equipment within the Topgolf venues is custom built, primarily by domestic manufacturers.
Sales
Revenues from venues are primarily derived from gameplay, the sale of food and beverage, and events and advertising partnerships and sponsorships. Topgolf venues offer multiple forms of entertainment and are equipped with technology-enabled hitting bays, dining areas, bars, and exclusive event spaces. The technology-enabled hitting bays incorporate proprietary ball-tracking technologies which “gamify” the sport of golf and offer guests of varying skill levels a variety of games that are aimed to appeal to a broad range of players. Topgolf venues also provide flexible spaces that are used for dining, watching sports, charity fundraisers, corporate events, golf instruction, game play and live music performances. Topgolf hosts events similar to arenas and other types of entertainment venues which range in size from seven to over 1,000 attendees. These events provide food and beverage and game play throughout the venue for corporate and social groups, and typically include meetings, team-building events, client entertainment, birthday parties, tournaments, fundraisers, concerts and more. 
Competition
Topgolf venues compete for consumers’ leisure time and discretionary entertainment dollars against a broad range of other out-of-home entertainment options including other dining and entertainment venues, sports activity centers, traditional driving ranges and other establishments offering simulated golf or multi-sport experiences, arcades and entertainment centers, movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, nightclubs, and bars and restaurants.
Advertising & Marketing
Topgolf venues play a lead role in connecting people in meaningful ways by introducing guests to the brand, as well as its culture and technologies. Topgolf places a large focus on its owned channels of communication to fuel a more personalized approach for attracting repeat visits through email and text messages to its large subscriber base. Venues are also advertised across various marketing channels, including content distributed through paid advertising networks, email and text message subscriber lists, on Topgolf and other online social media and influencer pages and websites, by word-of-mouth, or through other media coverage.
Seasonality
Topgolf sales generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors. Historically, venues experience higher sales during the second and third quarters, which are associated with the spring and summer seasons, while sales at the venues have historically been lower during the first and fourth quarters, which are associated with the cold-weather months of fall and winter. Seasonality is expected to be a factor in Topgolf’s results of operations, and as a result, factors affecting peak seasons at venues, such as adverse weather, could have a disproportionate effect on Topgolf’s operating results.
Other Lines of Business
Topgolf licenses Toptracer, its proprietary ball-tracking technology to independent driving ranges, golf courses and for use in golf broadcasts. Toptracer delivers a data-driven and “gamified” enhancement to the traditional driving range experience by delivering instant shot replays, gameplay for all skill levels and a data record of all shots. The Toptracer ball-tracking technology actively tracks all ball flight paths across an entire field of vision, and its custom-built sensor provides shot analytics, such as ball speed, apex, curve, carry and more, in real time. Components used in the Toptracer business are sourced from a number of third-party suppliers located in Germany, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States, either directly or indirectly through distributors. Topgolf has developed a global distribution strategy for the Toptracer range business that utilizes a third-party logistics partner for warehousing and distribution, with warehouses currently located in the United States and the United Kingdom. To help build brand awareness, Topgolf primarily utilizes public relations, influencer marketing, professional athletes, social media, conferences, event marketing and paid media to support lead generation and sales efforts. Toptracer competes against other companies to attract and retain qualified licensees. The ability to attract new franchisees and licensees is based primarily on the strength and quality of the brand and reputation, the products and revenue opportunities Topgolf is able to provide, as well as on the structure of the operating models and the terms of the respective agreements. The Company anticipates expanding the global reach of its Toptracer range technology product by leveraging the strong relationships the Toptracer and Callaway sales teams have around the world.
Topgolf’s digital media platform is primarily comprised of digital games such as the mobile golf game World Golf Tour (“WGT”) and other digital content creation. WGT is an online multiplayer virtual golf game that utilizes proprietary GPS and 3D technology to enable players to gather online as a community and experience simulated gameplay on photorealistic recreations of more than 16 world-famous golf courses. Digital gaming and content produced by Topgolf compete for consumers’ attention, leisure time and discretionary spending against the other at-home entertainment alternatives, particularly content focused on golf or other sports.
GOLF EQUIPMENT
The Company designs, manufactures and sells a full line of high-quality golf equipment, which is comprised of the golf clubs and golf balls product groups. The Company designs its golf equipment products to be technologically advanced for amateur and professional golfers of all skill levels, and the golf equipment products are generally designed to conform to the Rules of Golf as published by the United States Golf Association (“USGA”) and the ruling authority known as The R&A. 
Products
Golf clubs include woods (drivers, fairway woods and hybrids) and irons (irons, wedges and packaged sets) sold under the Callaway brand, and putters sold under the Odyssey brand, including Toulon Design by Odyssey. This product group also includes Callaway and non-Callaway pre-owned golf clubs. Callaway’s golf clubs are generally made of steel, titanium alloys, carbon fiber and various thermoplastic and thermoset materials.
Golf balls are sold under the Callaway Golf and Strata brands and are generally either a 2-piece golf ball (consisting of a core and cover) or a multilayer golf ball (consisting of two or more components in addition to the cover). The Company’s golf ball products include covers that incorporate a traditional dimple pattern as well as covers that incorporate innovative designs, including the Company’s proprietary HEX Aerodynamics (i.e., a lattice of tubes that form hexagons and pentagons), Hybrid Cover, Triple Track Technology and Truvis patterns. Callaway brand golf balls are generally made of various combinations of synthetic rubber, ionomer blends and urethane which are processed with other chemicals in order to optimize performance.
Product Design and Development
The Company innovates to maintain its market share leadership position in both golf clubs and golf balls by continuously investing in research and development and also leveraging artificial intelligence in its product design process in order to help create products that are designed to be technologically advanced and not limited to the duplication of traditional or conventional product designs. The Company creates and modifies product designs by using computer-aided design software, finite element analysis software and structural optimization techniques which leverage artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the Company utilizes a variety of testing equipment and computer software, including golf robots, launch monitors, a proprietary virtual test center, a proprietary performance analysis system, an indoor test range and other methods to develop and test its golf equipment products. 
Manufacturing
The Company has a primary golf club assembly facility located in Monterrey, Mexico, a limited golf club assembly facility located in Carlsbad, California, and a facility in Austin, Texas where the Company refurbishes used clubs that it receives from its Trade-In! Trade-Up! program. Additionally, the Company utilizes golf club contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam, and custom golf clubs are also assembled at facilities in Tokyo, Japan; Swindon, England; Melbourne, Australia, and other local markets, based on regional demand. Currently, more than 50% of Company’s golf club assembly is performed in regions outside of the United States. Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive, utilizes raw materials that are obtained from international and domestic suppliers, and requires extensive global supply chain coordination.
The Company has a golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and also utilizes golf ball contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan. In 2022, approximately 75% of the Company’s golf ball units were manufactured in regions outside of the United States. The golf ball manufacturing process utilizes raw materials that are obtained from international and domestic suppliers. 
Sales
The Company sells its golf equipment products domestically and internationally, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to wholesale customers, including golf course pro shops, off-course retailers, sporting goods retailers, online retailers, and third-party distributors, as well as certain products to mass merchants. The Company also directly sells to consumers through its websites and retail locations in Japan and Korea. The Company also sells its golf equipment products to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted on certain of the Company’s golf equipment products, and also offers custom club fitting programs at its performance centers and at participating on- and off- course retail stores to help consumers find golf clubs that fit their personal specifications.
The Company also sells certified pre-owned golf clubs directly to the consumer through its website. The pre-owned golf clubs are generally acquired through the Company’s Trade In! Trade Up! program, which gives golfers the opportunity to trade in their used Callaway brand golf clubs and certain competitor golf clubs at authorized retailers or through its website for credit toward the purchase of new golf equipment or pre-owned golf clubs.
Competition
For its golf equipment products, the Company generally competes on the basis of technology, quality, performance, customer service and price. In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Company’s response to such factors, management receives and evaluates Company-generated market trends for the United States and foreign markets, as well as periodic public and customized market research for United States and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) markets from Golf Datatech and The National Golf Foundation which include trends from certain on- and off-course retailers. Additionally, the Company utilizes the Growth from Knowledge Group for data and analysis of the consumer goods market in Japan.
The Company’s major competitors for drivers, fairway woods and irons are TaylorMade, Ping, Acushnet (Titleist brand), Puma (Cobra brand), SRI Sports Limited (Cleveland and Srixon brands), Mizuno, Bridgestone, and Parsons Xtreme Golf (PXG). For putters, the Company’s major competitors are Acushnet (Titleist & Scotty Cameron brands), Ping and TaylorMade. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in every golf club market in which it competes.
The Company’s major competitors for golf balls include Acushnet (Titleist and Pinnacle brands), SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands), Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands), TaylorMade and others. These competitors compete for market share in the golf ball business, with Acushnet having a market share of over 50% of the golf ball business in the United States and a leading market share position in certain other regions outside of the United States. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in the golf ball market in which it competes. 
Advertising & Marketing
The Company’s marketing campaigns for its golf equipment products are aimed to increase consumer product awareness and support the Company’s overall growth strategy. Advertising for the Company’s golf equipment products is mainly in the form of televised commercials during golf telecasts, primarily on The Golf Channel, web-based digital and social media advertising, printed advertisements in national magazines, such as Golf Magazine and Golf Digest, as well as in-store advertising and other types of advertising and marketing to consumers who are part of the Topgolf community. The Company also establishes relationships with professional athletes and personalities, including members of various professional golf tours as well as other athletes and personalities, in order to promote the Company’s golf equipment products. 
Seasonality
In most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company’s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months, making the Company’s golf equipment business subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter when sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales generally also depend on reorder business, but can also include smaller new product launches, and typically have lower sales than the second quarter since many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter golf equipment sales are generally less than the other quarters due to it being the end of the golf season in many of the Company’s key regions, but may also be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company’s sales from its Golf Equipment business and most, if not all, of its profitability from this segment generally occurs during the first half of the year.

Sales
The Company sells its soft goods products in the United States and internationally, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to wholesale customers and directly to consumers through its retail locations and online through its websites.
The Company sells its Callaway soft goods products to golf retailers (including pro shops at golf courses and off-course retailers), sporting goods retailers, online retailers, and third-party distributors, as well as directly to consumers through the Callaway Golf website and various retail, outlet and store-in-store locations in Japan and Korea.

Competition
The Company’s major competitors for its golf apparel and accessories are generally other golf companies and premium golf apparel companies, as well as specialty retailers. While the TravisMathew business faces competition from the premium golf apparel companies, it also competes in department stores with other men’s apparel companies, including Bonobos, johnnie-O, Nike, Peter Millar, Ted Baker London and Vince. With the addition of the Jack Wolfskin business, there are a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names with which the Company competes, including Patagonia, Columbia and The North Face. The Company seeks to differentiate itself through elevated design, premium materials and product innovation.
Advertising & Marketing
The Company markets and advertises its soft goods brands on various platforms, including television, traditional digital and print media, web-based and social media, as well as at experimental events and Topgolf venues and media. The Company also establishes relationships with professional athletes and personalities, including members of various professional golf tours, as well as other athletes and personalities, in order to promote the Company’s soft goods product lines.
Seasonality
Sales of the Callaway-branded golf apparel and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf equipment, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year. Sales of TravisMathew branded golf and lifestyle apparel and accessories are more evenly spread throughout the year as sales are more diversified due to an increase in direct-to-consumer sales resulting from the expansion of TravisMathew stores, which is expected to continue. Sales of outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment related to the Jack Wolfskin business focuses primarily on outerwear and consequently experiences stronger sales for such products during cold-weather months and the corresponding prior sell-in periods, and therefore, are generally greater during the second half of the year.
DISTRIBUTION

By being active and visible in the community and by embracing the principles of environmental stewardship, the Company believes it is acting in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. In 2019, the Company, at the direction of its Chief Executive Officer with oversight from the Board of Directors, formally launched the Global Sustainability Program. The goal of this program is to bring increased awareness and structure to the Company’s existing social and environmental sustainability initiatives, while also enhancing the sustainability efforts across its global businesses. In connection with launching the Global Sustainability Program, the Company established an Executive Sustainability Committee comprising its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and all other executive officers. A Sustainability Core Team meets and then reports progress of the Global Sustainability Program quarterly to the Executive Sustainability Committee. Members of the Sustainability Core Team, known as Sustainability Champions, are employees who have been selected from throughout the organization to drive large-scale global projects that build upon the Company’s existing environmental and social sustainability efforts. Sustainability Champions also promote smaller-scale employee-driven initiatives at the local levels. These projects and initiatives are benchmarked against the sustainability frameworks published by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board with respect to sustainability issues that are likely to affect the financial conditions or operating performances of companies in the consumer goods, apparel and entertainment sectors.
The Company’s entire Board of Directors oversee the Global Sustainability Program and receives a comprehensive report regarding the program’s initiatives and progress on an annual basis. Additionally, management provides a quarterly update to the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the Company’s latest third-party performance scores on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics to maintain a consistent pulse on the Company’s ESG performance.
The Global Sustainability Program has played an integral role in assessing the Company’s material ESG concerns and developing the Company’s sustainability strategy, goals, and the inaugural Sustainability Report for the year ended December 31, 2021, which the Company published on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website in 2022. The Global Sustainability Program has also introduced a variety of new initiatives across the Company, including: enhancing sustainability content on the Company’s website; and engaging employees globally to devise new sustainability action plans for the Company’s various brands and workspaces.
Environmental Matters
The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, “Environmental Laws”). During the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials which generate waste and waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws. In addition, in connection with the Company’s Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts. In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations. As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations.
The Company strives to adhere to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws. The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico. The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance. The Company conducts third party social, safety and environmental responsibility audits to evaluate and improve its environmental performance through its global supply chain. The audits facilitate compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and good manufacturing practices within the global supply chain. Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company believes that its operations, including Topgolf, are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, the Company cannot predict with certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable Environmental Laws. 
Social Matters
The Company maintains a Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy, which establish the foundation of its Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Program that was established in 2007. In 2019, the Company updated its CSR audit policy and procedure, benchmarking against the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labor Organization Guidelines. The Company takes actions as necessary to ensure supplier compliance, and actively works with suppliers to improve performance through training, internal and third-party audits and corrective action plan validation. The Company employs a team to conduct and oversee corporate social responsibility audits globally and has not identified any material compliance issues with its suppliers to date. In addition to the CSR Program, the Company participates in environmental, social and product compliance working groups through the American Apparel and Footwear Association and is a signatory to the Responsible Recruiting Commitment and Cambodia (Worker’s Rights) Brand Letter. Also, Jack Wolfskin’s engagement in the Fair Wear Foundation promotes social responsibility and transparency in the supply chain.
