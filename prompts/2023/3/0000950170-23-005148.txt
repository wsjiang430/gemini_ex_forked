We have a technical relationship representatives located at most of our facilities.
We integrate new business wins into our facilities via a rigorous product transition process, working in concert with our customers to ensure all production, cleaning and/or test requirements are identified, documented, and validated. We employ the same process at all our sites, enabling products and service offerings to smoothly transition between our facilities as needed to support customer demand.
In addition, we have developed an overall infrastructure to provide our customers with service and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our dedicated global field service engineers provide customer support through the performance of on-site installation, servicing and repair.
Technology Development
 We engage in ongoing technology development efforts to remain a leader for gas delivery systems and to further develop our expertise in other critical subsystems. We work closely with our customers to identify and anticipate changes and trends in next-generation equipment and partner with them on process application requirements for gas

and liquid delivery systems and other critical subsystems. These development efforts are designed to meet specific customer requirements in the areas of subsystem design, materials, component selection and functionality. Our technology development group also works directly with our suppliers to help them identify new component technologies and make necessary changes or enhancements to, the components that we integrate into our products. Our analytical and testing capabilities enable us to evaluate multiple supplier component technologies and provide our customers with a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems.
 Our analytical and testing capabilities also help us anticipate technological changes and requirements in component features for our core next-generation gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. We are continuously developing additional features to improve the performance and functionality of these subsystems. Our technology development activities for next-generation gas delivery and other critical subsystems are performed in Hayward, CA and Israel.
 We are actively developing new technology and processes to maintain our leadership in the cleaning, coating and analytical markets. Our Services business works closely with customers to identify and anticipate changes that will be required in next-generation equipment. UCT’s technical capability is extremely critical and differentiated to ensure high wafer yields and throughput as geometries shrink and density increases. Our Services business development activities are performed primarily in Hillsboro, Oregon; Phoenix, Arizona; Israel and South Korea.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Both our products and services businesses largely depend upon our design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, cleaning, coating and analytical know-how. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and confidentiality provisions, and to a lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. We have over 100 patents with various expiration dates, and intellectual property that we develop on behalf of our customers that is generally owned exclusively by those customers.
 We require our employees, suppliers, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose to them any sensitive or proprietary information regarding our products, technology or business plans. We require employees to assign to us proprietary information, inventions and other intellectual property they create, modify or improve.
 Competition
 When we compete for new business, it is typically against other suppliers of gas delivery systems, critical subsystems, parts and components, cleaning and analytical services, as well as the internal manufacturing and services groups of our customers. Customers that have elected to outsource their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including cleaning and analytics, could elect in the future to develop and manufacture these subsystems internally, leading to further competition.
 Our principal competitor for gas delivery systems is Ichor Systems, Inc., and our principal competitors for other critical subsystems are Flex Ltd., Foxsemicon Integrated Technology Inc., Jabil, Inc., Sanmina Corporation, Fujikin Incorporated, VDL ETG and Celestica Inc. For our gas delivery component solutions our principal competitors are Swagelok, Parker Hannifin, and Watlow. For our services, cleaning and coating offerings, our main competitors in the US are Pentagon Technologies and Cleanpart, and in South Korea, KoMiCo. For analytical services our primary competitors are Balazs (an Air Liquide company) and Cerium Labs. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than UCT. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products.
The limited number of potential customers in our industry further intensifies competition. The primary competitive factors in our industry are quality, meeting customer timeline requirements, price, technology, design-to-delivery cycle time, customer qualification approvals, and the development of product recipes for cleaning and analytics and historical customer relationships. We anticipate that increased competitive pressures will cause intensified price-based competition and we may have to reduce the prices of our products. In addition, we expect to face new competitors as we enter new markets or otherwise expand our products and service offerings.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory requirements and foreign laws relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous substances and waste, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the construction and operation of our UCT facilities.
 In 2020, we committed to a program titled “SuCCESS2030” designed to enhance our sustainability vision through our supply chain. We are endeavoring to identify and coordinate efforts and develop our capabilities to ensure our suppliers operate in an ethical, responsible, and sustainable manner. The goal is to build a responsible and sustainable end-to-end supply chain for the future of semiconductors.
 We participate in the Responsible Business Alliance’s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process for Tantalum. Our cleaning processes for tantalum-deposited parts recovers the tantalum, enabling it to re-enter the commodity market and reduce the demand for mined material, the majority of which originates from the Conflict Region in Africa.
Although cleaning is a chemical-intensive business we utilize chemical-free processing whenever possible to remove significant volumes of deposited material. Reduction in the volume of film being chemically removed reduces the amount of chemicals used to meet the target cleanliness specifications.
 The semiconductor industry has stringent packaging requirements which include the need to maintain the cleanliness of a part/system while providing structural support of heavy modules. These requirements may necessitate the design and fabrication of product-specific crates or the use of plastic cleanroom boxes. To minimize packaging waste we have implemented re-use programs with our customers and suppliers for these type of materials.
Our past or future operations may result in injury or claims of injury by employees or the public which may result in material costs and liabilities. Although some risk of costs and liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business, we believe that our business is compliant with applicable U.S. and international regulations and laws. However, new, modified or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted by governmental agencies, which could affect our business operations.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 30, 2022, we had 7,765 employees, of which 1,205 were temporary. Of our total employees, there were 126 in engineering, 24 in technology development, 378 in sales and support, 5,245 in direct manufacturing, 1,255 in indirect manufacturing and 540 in administrative and executive functions. These figures include 3,555 employees in Asia Pacific and 1,700 employees in EMEA. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
 UCT believes that its employees are its most important assets. The Company has a long history of embracing diversity, multiculturalism and belonging and is reinforcing a culture of inclusion by committing to even greater transparency, clearer targets and comprehensive training to improve diversity and inclusion within the company to ensure every employee is treated with dignity and respect.
