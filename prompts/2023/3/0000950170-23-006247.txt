Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a human-centric technology company powered by our proven, science-based, clinically effective weight loss and weight management program and an award-winning digital subscription platform. We are focused on inspiring people to adopt healthy habits for real life. With nearly six decades of weight management experience, expertise and know-how, we are one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight-conscious consumers. We educate our members and provide them with guidance, digital tools and an inspiring community to enable them to develop healthy habits and focus on their overall health and wellness. WW-branded services and products include digital offerings provided through our apps and websites, workshops, consumer products, and various events. Our business has gone through a significant shift to a digital subscription model over the past several years and our primary sources of revenue are subscriptions for our digital products and for our workshops. Our “Digital” business refers to providing subscriptions to our digital product offerings. Our “Workshops + Digital” business refers to providing unlimited access to our workshops combined with our digital subscription product offerings to commitment plan subscribers. For additional details on certain historic offerings in each business, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We combine technology and community to help members reach and sustain their weight loss goals on our science-based program. We believe that the power of our communities -- via our exclusive social network, Connect, and our workshops -- increases accountability and provides our members with inspiration, human connection, and support. This inspires them and enables them to build healthier and more fulfilling food, activity, mindset and sleep habits. Our brands enjoy high awareness and credibility among all types of consumers—women and men, consumers online and offline, the support-inclined and the self-help-inclined. We believe that our program conveys an image of healthy, livable, sustainable and effective weight management in a supportive environment. The efficacy of our commercial weight management programs has been clinically proven in numerous studies and trials. As the number of overweight and obese people worldwide grows, the need for an effective, scalable and consumer-friendly weight management program increases. We believe our global presence and brand awareness uniquely position us in the global weight management market, and thereby provide us a unique platform to impact the wellness market.
 We have built our business by helping millions of people around the world lose weight and build healthy habits through a sensible, sustainable and livable approach to weight loss and weight management. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had a total of approximately 3.5 million subscribers, of which approximately 2.8 million were Digital subscribers and approximately 0.7 million were Workshops + Digital subscribers. Our strong brands, together with the effectiveness of our program, loyal customer base, strong digital offerings and community, enable us to attract new and returning customers.
 Business Organization
 For fiscal 2022 and in recent years, we had four reportable segments based on an integrated geographical structure as follows: North America, Continental Europe (CE), United Kingdom and Other. Each reportable segment provided similar services and products. Our “North America” reportable segment consisted of our United States and Canada Company-owned operations; our “Continental Europe” reportable segment consisted of our Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden Company-owned operations; our “United Kingdom” reportable segment consisted of our United Kingdom Company-owned operations; and our “Other” reportable segment consisted of our Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil Company-owned operations, as well as revenues and costs from our franchises in the United States and certain other countries.
Change in Segment Reporting
 Effective the first day of fiscal 2023 (i.e., January 1, 2023), we realigned our organizational structure and resources to more closely align with our strategic priorities and centralized the global management of certain functions and systems. As a result of the change in our organizational structure, we now have two reportable segments, consisting of North America and International, for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance. The new reportable segments will continue to provide similar services and products. The segment information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect this change in reportable segments as the change did not take effect internally until our first quarter of fiscal 2023. We will begin reporting segment information based on these new segments in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For details on our reportable segments in fiscal 2022, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Services and Products
 Our Program and Food Plan
 We offer services and products that are based on our weight loss and weight management program and that help our members build habits to lead healthier, more active, more fulfilling lives. Our program is rooted in advanced nutrition science and founded on a simplified, holistic approach for the body and mind. It is comprised of a range of science-based nutritional, activity, behavioral and lifestyle tools and approaches. Our program continues to be grounded in our scientific Points system, which uses a proprietary nutritional algorithm to assign each food a value based on its calorie, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, added sugar, protein and fiber content. After a proprietary, personal assessment takes into account a member’s metabolic rate, members receive a tailored daily and weekly Points Budget to guide them towards healthy foods and appropriate portion sizes, forming the foundation of a healthy eating pattern. Members can also take advantage of over 200 ZeroPoint foods (nutritious foods which do not need to be weighed, measured, or tracked). Our program can also take into account the dietary needs of those living with diabetes by tailoring their plans towards foods that are less likely to impact blood sugar levels.
 In addition to focusing on healthy eating habits, and in furtherance of our mission to focus on overall health and wellness, our program also provides tools to address other aspects of a healthy and fulfilled life. These include a customized weekly activity target, trackers for food, water, activity, sleep and weight (and, for members on our diabetes-tailored plan, a tracker for blood sugar) and content regarding behavioral techniques for building healthy habits. WW’s Connect platform, a members-only social network accessed through our app, fosters meaningful relationships by helping people find communities based on interests including food preferences, identity cohorts, wellness journey, activity, mindset, hobbies, locations, events and workshops.
 Our Subscription Businesses
 Our members mainly participate in our program either by solely using our digital product or by using our digital product supplemented by group workshops. Within these two channels, members can find services and tools that best meet their preferences and needs. Additionally, our coaches educate members on our program and provide inspiration and support to members in developing healthy habits.
 The payment structure for our services globally is through subscription plans. Pursuant to these plans, a member typically commits to a minimum term and is automatically charged on a monthly basis until the member elects to cancel.


Digital Business
 In our Digital business, we offer a digital subscription product based on the WW approach to weight loss and weight management. Our app provides interactive and personalized resources that allow subscribers to follow our weight management program. These resources also help subscribers adopt a healthier and more active lifestyle, a helpful mindset, and healthy habits, with a view toward long-term behavior modification — a key aspect of the WW approach toward healthy and sustainable weight loss. Our app provides subscribers with content, functionality, access to coaches on Connect and wellness resources. We believe our personalized and interactive Digital subscription product gives subscribers an engaging experience. Our Connect online community, which can be accessed via our app and our web-based platform, gives our subscribers a way to stay virtually connected and support and inspire each other. We continually innovate our Digital offerings to maximize the design, usability, features and capabilities of our app to support our weight loss and weight management program and community. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had approximately 2.8 million Digital subscribers.
Workshops + Digital Business
 In our Workshops + Digital business, we present our program in workshops of 30 to 45 minutes in duration, conveniently scheduled throughout the day. In March 2020, we introduced virtual workshops in immediate response to the impact of COVID-19, and we continue to innovate this offering to address the shift in consumer sentiment towards digitally-enabled offerings. For more information on the impact of COVID-19, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Material Trends—COVID-19 Pandemic” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Workshops + Digital members can attend unlimited workshops both virtually and, where available, in-person. Our interactive communities remain the cornerstone of our workshops. Coaches facilitate interactive workshops that encourage learning and inspire members to make positive changes towards their individual goals. Members provide each other inspiration and support by sharing their experiences with, and by providing encouragement and empathy to, other people on weight loss and weight management journeys. In addition, our members have access to our digital tools to assist them on their journeys. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had approximately 0.7 million Workshops + Digital subscribers.
 We have franchisees in a limited number of territories. In fiscal 2022, revenues from our franchisees were immaterial. Pursuant to long-standing agreements, we and our franchisees typically pay each other royalties and other fees. We have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with our franchisees over many years. Most franchise agreements are perpetual and can be terminated only upon a material breach or bankruptcy of the franchisee.
Our Consumer Product Sales
 We sell a range of consumer products that complement our program and help our customers in their weight management efforts. Our WW-branded products include bars, snacks, cookbooks and kitchen tools. We also license our trademarks and other intellectual property in certain categories of food, beverages and other relevant consumer products and services. Additionally, we co-brand or endorse with carefully selected branded consumer products and services. We primarily sell consumer products online through our e-commerce platforms, at our studios, and through our trusted partners. In fiscal 2022, sales of consumer products represented approximately 9.4% of our total revenues. By partnering with carefully selected companies in categories relevant and helpful to weight- and health-conscious consumers, we have a high margin licensing business that gives us access to these consumers and also increases the awareness of our brands. In connection with our acquisition from The Kraft Heinz Company (successor to H.J. Heinz Company), or Heinz, in September 1999, Heinz received a perpetual royalty-free license to continue using our brand in certain food categories. We believe that the strength of the WW brands will create new long-term licensing and partnership opportunities for us.
Healthcare Offerings
 As healthcare costs continue to be a significant concern on the minds of employers and their employees, we believe that our broad range of services and products uniquely positions us to serve the market and help employers reduce their healthcare costs and improve the overall well-being of their employees. We are leveraging our organizational capability to serve employers with both our Digital and Workshops + Digital offerings.
 We believe the healthcare market, including the diabetes segment, represents an important channel to reach new consumers. We continue to explore different approaches to, and strategies for, this market.


Our Clinical Efficacy and Reputation in the Marketplace
 WW is one of the most clinically-studied commercial weight management programs, including by way of more than 140 published, scientific, peer reviewed studies (including over 35 randomized controlled trials) over more than four decades. For example, in 2022, a randomized controlled trial conducted by research teams at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, University of British Columbia, and University of Leeds and funded by us was published in JAMA Network Open and found that study participants assigned to WW for 12 months had over two times more weight loss compared to participants who were assigned to a do-it-yourself weight loss approach. In addition, those assigned to the WW program were more likely to achieve clinically significant weight loss of five percent at three and twelve months. Research has shown that WW has an impact that reaches beyond our members. In 2018, a 6-month randomized controlled trial conducted by researchers at the University of Connecticut funded by us and published in Obesity showed a “ripple effect” of WW – significant weight loss among untreated spouses of WW members.
 In 2021, a six-month clinical trial of our program conducted by the University of Connecticut and funded by us found that participants on the program experienced clinically significant benefits, including weight loss. Study participants reported a 40% increase in their healthy habits as well as a 15% decrease in hunger.
 WW also has demonstrated efficacy among individuals with diabetes and prediabetes. In 2016, a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Indiana University School of Medicine and funded by us was published in the American Journal of Public Health and found that adults with prediabetes following our Diabetes Prevention Program, or DPP, lost significantly more weight and experienced better blood sugar control than those following a self-initiated diabetes prevention program using supplemental counseling materials. A continuation study published in 2018 showed that these outcomes were maintained at 18 and 24 months and that our DPP was highly cost-effective. Another randomized controlled trial conducted by the Medical University of South Carolina, funded by us and published in Obesity in 2016, found that adults with Type 2 diabetes who followed our diabetes program lost significantly more weight and experienced better blood sugar control than those in a standard diabetes care program. In 2021, a clinical trial conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, University of Florida and Virginia Commonwealth University and funded by us found that the WW program, modified for adults with Type 2 diabetes, had favorable and clinically meaningful effects on glycemic control, body weight and diabetes distress at 12 and 24 weeks. In 2020, a review published in Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America highlighted the potential for physicians to refer patients with obesity to commercial weight loss programs. It noted that WW is one of only four commercial weight loss programs meeting guideline-recommended standards with demonstrated safety and efficacy at 12 months and one of only two commercial weight loss programs with demonstrated effects on reducing HbA1c levels in participants with Type 2 diabetes. Authors of the review concluded physicians might consider referral to WW for patients with obesity and those with obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
 Our efficacy and the value of our offerings are also well-acknowledged in the marketplace. For instance, in 2023, we again were recognized by U.S. News & World Report in the “Best Diets” rankings, including ranking #1 for “Best Weight-Loss Diets” for the thirteenth consecutive year and #1 for “Best Diet Programs.”
 Marketing and Promotion
 Our communications with consumers and other promotional efforts enhance our brand image and awareness, and motivate both former and potential new customers to join WW. We utilize a data-driven approach to our media placements, promotional offers, and website and app store presence to enhance marketing efficiency, drive conversion, and maximize subscription value. Our advertising campaigns are supported across multiple platforms (e.g., television, YouTube, social media, programmatic, audio, search, affiliate, branded content, electronic customer relationship marketing (eCRM), direct mail, and public relations). We develop and maintain a high level of engagement with current and potential customers on various social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Also, we utilize brand ambassadors, spokespersons and social media influencers, including celebrities, as part of our advertising and marketing.
 In addition to the above advertising channels, we take advantage of other channels for which we are uniquely positioned given our long history and network of WW coaches and members. The word of mouth generated by our current and former members, combined with our strong brand and known effectiveness, enable us to attract new and returning members. We also carry out many of our key public relations initiatives through the efforts of current and former WW coaches and members, and celebrity brand ambassadors.


In October 2015, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Oprah Winfrey, pursuant to which, among other things, Ms. Winfrey provides us with services in her discretion to promote the Company and our programs, products and services, including in advertisements and promotions, and making personal appearances on our behalf. Further information on this agreement and our partnership with Ms. Winfrey can be found below under “—History—Winfrey Transaction.”
 Seasonality
 Our core business is seasonal due to the importance of the winter season to our overall member recruitment environment. Historically, we experience our highest level of recruitment during the first quarter of the year, which is supported with the highest concentration of advertising spending. Therefore, our number of End of Period Subscribers (as defined below) in the first quarter of the year is typically higher than the number in other quarters of the year, historically reflecting a decline over the course of the year.
Pending Acquisition of Weekend Health (d/b/a Sequence)
 On March 4, 2023, the Company, Well Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Weekend Health, Inc., doing business as Sequence, a Delaware corporation (“Weekend Health”), and Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the Equityholders’ Representative for Weekend Health, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides for the Company’s acquisition of Weekend Health (the “Acquisition”). Upon completion of the Acquisition, Weekend Health will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.
 As consideration for the Acquisition, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate amount equal to $132.0 million (inclusive of a minimum of $26.0 million of cash on the balance sheet of Weekend Health), subject to the adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Consideration”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Consideration shall be paid as follows: (i) $65.0 million in cash and $35.0 million in the form of 8,064,516 newly issued shares of Company common stock (valued at $4.34 per share), in each case, to be paid at the closing of the Acquisition, (ii) $16.0 million in cash to be paid on the first (1st) anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition, and (iii) $16.0 million in cash to be paid on the second (2nd) anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition. In addition, the Company expects to obtain a standard representation and warranty insurance policy in connection with the Merger Agreement.
 The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants customary for transactions of this type, including covenants regarding the operation of the business of Weekend Health prior to the closing of the Acquisition. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Weekend Health’s stockholders, and (ii) the continued employment of certain key employees of Weekend Health. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition of Weekend Health (d/b/a Sequence).” The closing of the Acquisition is not subject to any financing condition or the approval of the Company’s stockholders.
 Weekend Health provides a technology-powered care platform and mobile web application through its subscription based service, which includes a comprehensive weight management program, pharmacotherapy treatment, nutrition plans, health insurance coordination services, and access to clinicians, dietitians, fitness coaches and care coordinators.
 We are focused on expanding our offerings in weight management, and we expect Weekend Health will augment our current products and services by providing a digital health platform offering access to a clinical weight management program. By integrating our products and services, which are grounded in our decades of experience in nutrition and behavioral science-based weight management, with Weekend Health’s clinical expertise and digital infrastructure capabilities, which provide access to the latest innovations in pharmacotherapy treatments, we will strongly position ourselves to provide a differentiated, comprehensive suite of weight management products and services.


We expect the combination of Weekend Health’s services with our pre-existing lifestyle support and behavioral capabilities will create a unique and effective science-based direct-to-consumer service in the weight-management and wellness space. Members who are medically eligible may benefit from developments in the ever-evolving pharmacotherapy field, which we expect to complement our core program strengths and lifestyle approach with the support of our WW communities. Overall, we expect the Acquisition will further strengthen our ability to help people reach their weight-management and wellness goals.
 Competition
 We compete in the global weight management and wellness market. The weight management and wellness industries include commercial weight management programs; the pharmaceutical industry and prescription and over the counter weight management and weight loss pills and appetite suppressants; weight loss and wellness apps and monitoring solutions, such as wearable trackers; surgical procedures; the genetics and biotechnology industry; self-help weight management regimens and other self-help weight management products, services and publications, such as books, magazines, websites, and social media influencers and groups; dietary supplements and meal replacement products; healthy living services, coaching, products, content and publications; weight management services administered by doctors, nutritionists and dieticians; government agencies and non-profit groups that offer weight management services; fitness centers; and national drug store chains.
 Competition among commercial weight management programs is largely based on program recognition and reputation; the effectiveness, ease of use, safety, personalization and price of the program; and the related digital platform, content and user experience. We compete with several other companies in the commercial weight management industry, although we believe that in certain cases their businesses are not comparable to ours. For example, we believe our prominence as one of the most clinically-studied commercial weight management programs differentiates us from many of our competitors. Additionally, certain of these competitors’ businesses are based on the sale of pre-packaged meals and meal replacements. In conjunction with our flexible, healthy food plan and emphasis on behavioral change education, we believe that the power of our communities -- via our online social network, Connect, and workshops -- increases accountability and provides our members with inspiration, human connection, and support, which motivates them and enables them to build healthier and more fulfilling food, activity and lifestyle habits.
 We believe that food manufacturers that produce meal replacement products are not comparable competition because these businesses’ meal replacement products do not engender behavior modification through education in conjunction with a flexible, customized healthy food plan.
 We also compete with various self-help products, diets, services and publications, such as apps, activity monitors and other free or low-cost “do-it yourself” alternatives. Increased attention by consumers and the media to recent developments, innovations, and approvals of weight management drug therapies, and the perception of their safety, effectiveness and ease of use, may also delay or prevent consumer engagement in our core businesses.
 Trademarks, Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
 We own numerous domestic and international trademarks, patents, domain names and other proprietary rights that are valuable assets and are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the jurisdiction in which the patent is granted. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary from country to country depending upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and through domain name dispute resolution systems.
History
 Early Development
 In 1961, Jean Nidetch, our founder, attended a New York City obesity clinic and took what she learned from her personal experience at the obesity clinic and began weight-loss meetings with a group of her overweight friends in the basement of a New York apartment building. Under Ms. Nidetch’s leadership, the group members supported each other in their weight-loss efforts, and word of the group’s success quickly spread. Ms. Nidetch and Al and Felice Lippert, who all successfully lost weight through these efforts, formally launched our business in 1963. WW International, Inc. (formerly known as Weight Watchers International, Inc.) was incorporated as a Virginia corporation in 1974 and succeeded to the business started in New York in 1963. Heinz acquired us in 1978.
Artal Ownership
 In September 1999, Artal Luxembourg S.A., or Artal Luxembourg, acquired us from Heinz. Artal Luxembourg is an indirect subsidiary of Artal Group S.A., or Artal Group, which together with its parents and its subsidiaries is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Artal. Currently, Artal Luxembourg is the record holder of all our shares owned by Artal. As a result of Artal selling a portion of its shares of our common stock in fiscal 2018, we are no longer a “controlled company” under the rules of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq.
Winfrey Transaction
 On October 18, 2015, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Ms. Winfrey, or, as amended, the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Winfrey granted us the right to use, subject to her approval, her name, image, likeness and endorsement for and in connection with the Company and its programs, products and services (including in advertising, promotion, materials and content), and we granted Ms. Winfrey the right to use our trademarks and service marks to collaborate with and promote the Company and its programs, products and services. The Strategic Collaboration Agreement had an initial term of five years, or the Initial Term, with additional successive one year renewal terms. On December 15, 2019, we entered into an amendment of the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, or the Strategic Collaboration Amendment, with Ms. Winfrey, pursuant to which, among other things, the Initial Term was extended until April 17, 2023 (with no additional successive renewal terms) after which a second term will commence and continue through the earlier of the date of the Company’s 2025 annual meeting of shareholders or May 31, 2025, or the Second Term and together with the Initial Term, the Strategic Term. During the remainder of the Initial Term, Ms. Winfrey will consult with us and participate in developing, planning, executing and enhancing the WW programs and related initiatives, and provide us with services in her discretion to promote the Company and its programs, products and services, including in advertisements and promotions, and making personal appearances on our behalf. Subsequently, during the Second Term, Ms. Winfrey and the Company will collaborate with each other towards the mutual objective of advancing and promoting the WW programs and the Company, and in connection therewith, Ms. Winfrey will consult with the Company and participate in developing, planning, executing and enhancing the WW programs and related initiatives. In connection therewith, Ms. Winfrey will make available to the Company her knowledge, expertise, and abilities in the areas of corporate management, consumer insights, advertising and marketing, consumer motivation, and community activation and consult and participate in the design and planning of creative strategy and the related execution of the consumer experience in connection with the WW programs. In addition, throughout the Second Term, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, the Company will cause Ms. Winfrey to be nominated as a director of the Company. Ms. Winfrey will not grant anyone but the Company the right to use her name, image, likeness or endorsement for or in connection with any other weight loss or weight management programs during the Strategic Term, and she will not engage in any other weight loss or weight management business, program, products, or services during the Strategic Term and for one year thereafter. The Strategic Collaboration Amendment became operative on May 6, 2020 when our shareholders approved the Winfrey Amendment Option (as defined below).


On October 18, 2015, we also entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Ms. Winfrey, or, as amended, the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Ms. Winfrey an aggregate of 6,362,103 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $43,198,679. The purchased shares are subject to a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company. Under the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, Ms. Winfrey has certain demand registration rights and piggyback rights with respect to these purchased shares. On December 15, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Winfrey Purchase Agreement with Ms. Winfrey. Initially, the Winfrey Purchase Agreement provided Ms. Winfrey with the right to be nominated as a director of the Company for so long as she and certain permitted transferees own at least 3% of our issued and outstanding common stock. The amendment to the Winfrey Purchase Agreement provided Ms. Winfrey with the right to be nominated as a director of the Company through and until January 1, 2023. Ms. Winfrey was not required to resign as a director at such time. The amendment to the Winfrey Purchase Agreement became operative on May 6, 2020 when our shareholders approved the Winfrey Amendment Option.
 In consideration of Ms. Winfrey entering into the Strategic Collaboration Agreement and the performance of her obligations thereunder, on October 18, 2015, we granted Ms. Winfrey a fully vested option to purchase 3,513,468 shares of our common stock, or the Winfrey Option. The term sheet for the Winfrey Option, which includes the terms and conditions appended thereto, relating to the grant of the Winfrey Option is referred to herein as the Winfrey Option Agreement. The Winfrey Option is exercisable at a price of $6.97 per share, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 18, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances, including if (i) the Strategic Collaboration Agreement expires as a result of Ms. Winfrey’s decision not to renew the term of such agreement and (ii) a change in control (as defined in the Winfrey Option Agreement) of the Company occurs. The shares issuable upon exercise of the Winfrey Option are subject to a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company.
 In consideration of Ms. Winfrey entering into the Strategic Collaboration Amendment and the performance of her obligations thereunder, on December 15, 2019, the Company and Ms. Winfrey entered into a term sheet relating to the grant of a fully vested option to purchase 3,276,484 shares of our common stock, or the Winfrey Amendment Option. The term sheet for the Winfrey Amendment Option, which includes the terms and conditions appended thereto, is referred to herein as the Winfrey Amendment Option Agreement. Upon our shareholders approving the Winfrey Amendment Option on May 6, 2020, it became exercisable at a price of $38.84 per share, in whole or in part, at any time prior to November 30, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances, including if a change in control (as defined in the Winfrey Amendment Option Agreement) of the Company occurs. The shares issuable upon exercise of the Winfrey Amendment Option are subject to certain transfer restrictions and a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company.
 In fiscal 2020, as permitted under the Winfrey Purchase Agreement and the Winfrey Option Agreement transfer provisions, Ms. Winfrey sold 2,782,476 of the purchased shares discussed above and exercised a portion of the Winfrey Option resulting in the sale of 1,118,036 shares issuable under such option, respectively. Similarly, in fiscal 2021, Ms. Winfrey sold 1,541,564 of the purchased shares discussed above and exercised a portion of the Winfrey Option resulting in the sale of 581,348 shares issuable under such option.
 The transactions contemplated by the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, Winfrey Purchase Agreement, Winfrey Option Agreement and Winfrey Amendment Option Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the Winfrey Transaction. For additional information on risks arising from a potential loss of Ms. Winfrey’s services or a change in the nature of our partnership with her, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Loss of key personnel, strategic partners or consultants or failure to effectively manage and motivate our workforce could negatively impact our sales of services and products, business, financial condition and results of operations.” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Regulation
 A number of laws and regulations govern our advertising and marketing, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, licensees, franchisees, strategic and other contractual partners, coaches, guides, employees and government authorities in the countries in which we operate. Certain federal, state and foreign agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulate and enforce such laws and regulations relating to advertising and marketing, promotions, packaging, labeling, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. We are subject to many distinct employment, labor, commercial, benefits and tax laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including regulations affecting our employment and wage and hour practices and our relations with our coaches, guides and employees. Laws and regulations directly applicable to data protection and communications, operations or commerce over the Internet, such as those governing consumer protection, intellectual property, privacy and taxation, continue to evolve. Our operations are subject to these laws and regulations and we continue to monitor their development and our compliance. In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations in the United States and internationally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition of Weekend Health (d/b/a Sequence)—If the Acquisition is consummated, we expect to be subject to extensive fraud, waste, and abuse laws that may give rise to federal and state audits and investigations, including actions for false and other improper claims.”
 During the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials, claims for program success and program costs. In 1997, we entered into a consent order with the FTC settling all contested issues raised in the complaint filed against us. The consent order required us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of services and products and expired by its terms in 2017. From time to time, we have been in discussions with the FTC regarding such matters. Subsequent to our 2018 acquisition of Kurbo Health, Inc., or Kurbo, we engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding online privacy obligations associated with that program. In February 2022, the FTC filed a complaint and proposed settlement order to resolve allegations that Kurbo violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. We entered into a consent order with the FTC in March 2022 settling all contested issues raised in the complaint filed against us, and determined in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to exit the Kurbo business in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of our strategic plan.
Human Capital Management
 At WW our core mission is to inspire healthy habits for real life - for people, families, communities and the world. We believe that our workforce plays an integral role in achieving our mission. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,100 employees, a majority of whom were part-time employees. In addition, in certain of our international markets, our coaches and guides are self-employed and are not included in this total.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce helps us to explore and realize the many different paths to health and wellness for our members, which leads to better execution of our strategic initiatives. For example, over 50% of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Principal Financial Officer, are women. To further our commitment to create an inclusive and diverse culture, we have a Head of Inclusion & Diversity who reports directly to our Chief People Officer. Additionally, we offer forums and formal training programs for our employees to enable them to continue their education and share best practices and experiences, which creates an ongoing evolution and community with respect to diversity and inclusion and belonging in the workplace.
Training and Development
 We develop our personnel by offering in-house learning and development resources. These include online and in-person training programs on a variety of topics in order to foster career growth both long term and short term. For example, we offer leadership training to help ensure our future business leaders have the necessary skill sets to manage and lead our organization.
Wellness, Health and Safety
 We are focused on promoting the total wellness of our employees, and offer resources, programs and services to support our employees’ physical, mental, financial and social wellness. For example, in 2022 we improved and expanded our global paid parental leave policy for all parents (both full-time and part-time eligible employees), making us a leader in providing equitable and meaningful parental leave. We believe this investment not only contributes to gender balance and equity in care-taking, but is also linked to improved health and economic outcomes of women, children, and families.
 As a wellness company, we believe in creating a work environment that supports our employees’ wellbeing, while still maintaining our commitment to our members. Our work model, called Work from Wherever (WfW), is designed to enhance productivity and foster innovation by allowing our corporate employees and their leaders to work together in determining when, where and how they work to achieve the best possible results. We believe this approach strikes an appropriate balance between our purpose-driven culture of helping our members develop healthy habits while respecting the wellness, health and safety of our employees. To facilitate virtual and in-person collaboration, we offer forums and formal training programs to provide our employees with the tools and skills to be successful in a hybrid workplace. WfW continues to positively contribute to employee engagement and gives WW a competitive advantage in the external talent market.
 As always, protecting the privacy and security of our data is one of our top priorities, and we continue to enhance an advanced industry standard Zero-Trust software-defined network, coupled with multi-factor authentication, to secure our environment from unauthorized access.
Total Rewards
 We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level and by the country where the employees are located) include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, retirement benefits including 401(k) (or local market equivalent), healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, advocacy resources, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
