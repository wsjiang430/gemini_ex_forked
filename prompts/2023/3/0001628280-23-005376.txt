ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, that offer a clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients with significant unmet need. We have leveraged over 20 years of industry learning in the ADC field to develop three proprietary and differentiated platforms that enable us to develop ADCs designed to have improved efficacy, safety and tolerability relative to existing ADCs and other approved therapies.
We believe that our innovative platforms and our proprietary payloads together enable a robust discovery pipeline for us and our collaborators. Our investments in our novel and proprietary auristatin DolaLock payload, as well as our novel and proprietary STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist ImmunoLock payload, together with the good manufacturing practices supply chain established for our Dolaflexin, Dolasynthen and Immunosynthen platforms, enable our ability to apply these platforms to new and different targets and antibodies to create new product candidates. We call this our product engine. Our ADCs in preclinical studies and clinical trials include first-in-class molecules that target multiple tumor types with high unmet medical need. 
We have assembled a management team with extensive and relevant experience, including specific ADC experience, from prior work at leading pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer AG; Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS; Centocor Inc.; Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline plc; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Sanofi S.A.; Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Takeda; Tesaro, Inc. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. We are supported by our board of directors and scientific advisory board, who offer complementary experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, business development and public company management. We believe that our highly differentiated platforms, together with the team we have assembled, position us well to discover and develop life-changing ADCs for patients fighting cancer.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading oncology company by leveraging the potential of our innovative and differentiated ADC platforms and the experience and competencies of our management team to discover and develop promising ADC product candidates and to commercialize cancer therapeutics that address unmet medical needs or provide significant benefit to patients. We believe that executing against the following strategic objectives will help us achieve our goal:
•Build UpRi (upifitamab rilsodotin) into a Foundational Medicine in Ovarian Cancer. Our lead product candidate, upifitamab rilsodotin, which we refer to as UpRi, is a first-in-class Dolaflexin ADC targeting NaPi2b, an antigen broadly expressed in ovarian cancer and other cancers. We are currently evaluating UpRi in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in a single-arm registrational trial, which we refer to as UPLIFT, for which we completed enrollment of approximately 270 patients in October 2022. We expect to report top-line data from UPLIFT in mid-2023 following the major oncology conferences scheduled for June, and, if the data are positive, to submit a biologics license application, or BLA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the accelerated approval pathway around the end of 2023. We also initiated screening of patients in UP-NEXT, our Phase 3 clinical trial of UpRi as monotherapy maintenance treatment following treatment with platinum doublets in recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, in the third quarter of 2022, and we continue to enroll patients in this trial. If data from the trial are positive, we believe UP-NEXT could serve as a post-approval confirmatory trial in the United States, support potential approvals outside of the United States and support UpRi’s expansion into earlier lines of therapy. Additionally, we are also conducting a Phase 1 combination trial, which we refer to as UPGRADE-A, exploring the combination of UpRi with carboplatin, a standard platinum chemotherapy broadly used in the treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. We have completed the dose escalation portion of UPGRADE-A, initiated the dose expansion portion of UPGRADE-A in January 2023, and expect to present interim data from the trial in the second half of 2023. We may explore UpRi in combination with other therapies in a series of UPGRADE trials. Together, we believe that data from all of our clinical trials of UpRi have the potential to establish the safety and efficacy of UpRi across a wide range of ovarian cancer patients, from those who are platinum-resistant and heavily pre-treated to those in earlier lines of treatment for the disease. The European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation to UpRi for the treatment of ovarian cancer in December 2022. 
•Build Out Our Pipeline of Highly Impactful Cancer Medicines. We are investigating two additional ADC product candidates, XMT-1660 and XMT-2056, in Phase 1 clinical trials. XMT-1660 is a B7-H4-directed Dolasynthen ADC designed with a precise, target-optimized drug-to-antibody ratio, or DAR, of 6 and our DolaLock microtubule inhibitor payload with controlled bystander effect. We are currently enrolling patients in our multicenter Phase 1 trial investigating the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of XMT-1660 in patients with breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers, and began dosing patients in August 2022. We expect to complete the dose escalation portion of this trial in 2023. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to XMT-1660 for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. XMT-2056 is a systemically administered Immunosynthen STING agonist ADC (DAR 8) that is designed to target a novel epitope of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, distinct from that targeted by either trastuzumab or pertuzumab, and to locally activate STING signaling in both tumor-resident immune cells and in tumor cells, providing the potential to treat patients with HER2-high or -low tumors as monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care agents. We initiated a multicenter Phase 1 open-label trial of XMT-2056 in previously treated patients with advanced/recurrent solid tumors expressing HER2, including breast, gastric, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers, in January 2023. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to XMT-2056 for the treatment of gastric cancer in May 2022.
•Build Innovation and Scientific Leadership in ADCs. We believe we are establishing a leading position in the field of ADCs by leveraging our existing platforms, Dolaflexin, Dolasynthen and Immunosynthen, and continuing to advance new innovations. Additionally, we are discovering new product candidates for ourselves and for collaborators that we believe hold the potential to be first- and best-in-class medicines for patients with cancer in areas of high unmet medical need. XMT-2068 and XMT-2175 are among our preclinical candidates that leverage our Immunosynthen platform. 
•Build Relationships with Strategic Collaborators. We aim to leverage our technical expertise and experience with respect to our innovative and diversified platforms, to attract and cultivate strategic collaborations that facilitate our ability to bring differentiated product candidates to patients. We have established strategic research and development collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, or Merck KGaA, and its affiliate Ares Trading S.A., or MRKDG, for the development and commercialization of additional ADC product candidates leveraging our proprietary Dolasynthen, Dolaflexin and Immunosynthen platform technologies against a limited number of targets selected by our collaborators. We have also granted GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property (No. 4) Limited, or GSK, an exclusive option for an exclusive global license to co-develop and commercialize XMT-2056. We believe the potential of our ADC technologies, supported by our scientific and technical expertise and enabled by our intellectual property strategy, all support our independent and collaborative efforts to discover and develop life-changing ADCs for patients fighting cancer.
•Build Mersana with Top Talent. We aim to attract and retain talented team members with deep experience in drug discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization as well as in general business and administration. Our team is driven by a shared passion to advance therapies that can make a significant difference in the lives of cancer patients. We will continue to cultivate the collaborative and passionate workplace culture and diverse workforce that has allowed us to advance this mission.
Our current pipeline is summarized in the chart below:
ADC Background
ADCs are a validated therapeutic modality in oncology with 11 products currently approved for use by the FDA, and over 100 being tested in clinical trials. We believe that the field has not yet realized its full potential due to the limitations of first-generation ADCs and a scarcity of clinically meaningful platform innovation. 
First-generation ADCs were developed to deliver cytotoxic therapy specifically to neoplastic cells while sparing normal tissue. A cytotoxic ADC consists of three components: the antibody, the cytotoxic payload, and a linker to join the two. The antibody portion of the ADC achieves specific targeting by binding to an antigen that ideally has high expression on the surface of the tumor cells and low expression in healthy tissues. Once the antibody binds to the target, the ADC enters the cell, and the payload is typically released, killing the cell. 
The payload, the DAR, the linker, and conjugation site of the linker with the antibody all can influence the overall efficacy and tolerability of ADCs. There has been limited innovation in these ADC components since the development of first-generation ADC platforms. We believe optimizing an ADC requires developing payload(s) with optimal properties, varying DAR for a specific target, and optimizing the conjugation site, all of which can contribute to the overall drug-like properties. We believe that our proprietary platforms improve upon first-generation ADC approaches in these aspects and have the potential to advance the field and improve patient outcomes.
Our Technologies and Platforms
We believe the development of ADCs is not a one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, a number of diverse factors impact the properties of an ADC, including payload, DAR, site of conjugation and homogeneity. For each target antigen, there may be an optimal combination of these factors. Our novel and highly differentiated platforms are designed to allow us to optimize these properties for a given target and develop ADCs that are designed to best address patient needs.
DolaLock Payload
We refer to the cytotoxic payload we use with our Dolaflexin and Dolasynthen platforms as our DolaLock payload. Our DolaLock payload is a highly potent, proprietary auristatin anti-tubulin agent selectively toxic to rapidly dividing cells. The DolaLock payload has been shown in in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies to control the bystander effect by locking the cytotoxic drug inside cells after allowing a short period of antigen-independent diffusion throughout the tumor. As the drug diffuses through neighboring cells, the DolaLock payload is metabolized to a form that is still highly potent but is designed to no longer be able to cross the cell membrane. We believe this “controlled bystander effect” may allow for enhanced safety and efficacy.
A common mechanism of resistance in cancer is the up-regulation of multi-drug resistance, or MDR, pumps, such as P-glycoproteins, or PgPs, which can actively pump drugs out of cancer cells to help them survive. Once metabolized, our DolaLock payload is not a substrate for PgPs, thereby avoiding this resistance mechanism. Our DolaLock payload, with its controlled bystander effect, is designed to enable the creation of ADCs that have the potential of being highly potent, well-tolerated and specifically targeted cancer therapies.
In addition, our proprietary auristatin payload has also been shown in preclinical studies to cause immunogenic cell death and to stimulate the immune system through dendritic cell activation. Because of this, we have observed synergy with immuno-oncology agents such as PD-1 inhibitors in preclinical models.
Dolaflexin Platform
The Dolaflexin platform was designed to increase the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ADCs. Dolaflexin utilizes our proprietary Fleximer polymer, a biodegradable, highly biocompatible, water-soluble polymer that is able to carry multiple payloads. Instead of direct conjugation to an antibody, payloads are attached through an optimized, cleavable linker to the Fleximer scaffold, which is then conjugated to the antibody through a non-cleavable linker. Our Fleximer polymer allows for an increased number of payloads carried by each ADC as compared to other ADC therapies and has demonstrated dramatically improved drug solubility and pharmacokinetics with higher DAR.
As a result, we believe Dolaflexin has the potential to offer the following benefits relative to first-generation ADCs:
•Proprietary DolaLock Payload: Dolaflexin is loaded with our proprietary auristatin cytotoxic drug, which is a highly potent anti-tubulin agent that is selectively toxic to rapidly dividing cells and has a controlled bystander effect.
•Higher Drug-to-Antibody Ratio: Historically, ADCs typically have been limited to a DAR of 3-4. The Dolaflexin platform can deliver ADCs with DAR of approximately 10, which has enabled ADCs created using this platform to demonstrate greater preclinical efficacy while also maintaining pharmacokinetics and drug-like properties.
•Expanded Range of Addressable Tumor Targets: The higher DAR enabled by Dolaflexin results in a higher amount of cytotoxic drug released into the tumor cell for every ADC that is internalized. As a result, we believe that Dolaflexin ADCs may demonstrate efficacy against tumor targets with lower levels of antigen expression that traditional ADCs have been unable to address.
We believe Dolaflexin’s advantageous characteristics provide a substantial opportunity to address a broader range of cancers than first generation ADC-based approaches. Our lead clinical candidate, UpRi, is a Dolaflexin ADC that targets NaPi2b. We are currently evaluating UpRi in the UPLIFT, UP-NEXT and UPGRADE-A clinical trials.
Dolasynthen Platform
The Dolasynthen platform enables an iterative approach to designing customized ADCs for a given target while retaining the use of our proprietary DolaLock payload for a controlled bystander effect. Dolasynthen ADCs consist of a proprietary synthetic scaffold carrying an exact number of DolaLock payloads for precise control of DAR. The Dolasynthen scaffold is then 
bioconjugated to the antibody in a site-specific manner. The Dolasynthen scaffold has been precisely designed to provide optimal water solubility, charge balance, linker stability and DAR, which together offer an opportunity for our ADCs to have superior physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties relative to other ADC therapies.
We believe Dolasynthen ADCs have broad therapeutic potential as cancer therapies, and our preclinical data demonstrate the ability of the Dolasynthen platform to generate and identify the optimal ADC for a given target and antibody.
We believe that Dolasynthen offers the benefits of Dolaflexin, including the proprietary DolaLock payload, while also providing the following potential additional benefits relative to traditional ADC platforms:
•Precise Control of DAR: The optimal DAR may vary between different targets and antibodies. Dolasynthen uses a proprietary scaffold that allows for precise DARs between two and 24, enabling optimization of the DAR for specific antigens and antibodies.
•Site-Specific Bioconjugation: The site of scaffold bioconjugation to an antibody impacts the overall properties of that ADC. Dolasynthen enables site-specific bioconjugation, allowing further ADC optimization.
•Homogenous ADC Development: The DAR and antibody bioconjugation is consistent for each ADC developed with the Dolasynthen platform, allowing for consistent and precise drug delivery to targeted cancer cells. We believe this homogeneity may allow for enhanced safety, tolerability and efficacy.
•Increased Hydrophilicity: The precise optimization of the hydrophilic moiety on Dolasynthen ADCs allows for increased aqueous solubility and enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.
We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1660, our B7-H4-targeted Dolasynthen ADC.
ImmunoLock Payload 
We refer to the STING agonist that is used as the payload with our Immunosynthen platform as our ImmunoLock Payload. It was designed to have very low cell permeability in order to control delivery and localization of its innate immune-activating effect. STING is a well-studied innate immune pathway capable of inducing anti-tumor immune activity. Our preclinical data show that the anti-tumor activity of Immunosynthen ADCs carrying the ImmunoLock payload is driven by the targeted activation of the STING pathway in tumor-resident immune cells and in tumor cells, in a target-dependent manner. STING pathway activation in both cell types within the tumor provides the potential for enhanced anti-tumor activity with a STING-agonist ADC compared to other innate immune approaches, such as toll-like receptor, or TLR, agonists, that activate only the immune cells and are not capable of activating the tumor cells.
Immunosynthen Platform
Immunosynthen is our novel immunostimulatory ADC platform designed to take ADCs beyond the delivery of traditional cytotoxic payloads by enabling the targeted stimulation of the innate immune system. Through the tumor-targeted delivery of a novel STING agonist, ADCs created with our Immunosynthen platform have the potential to address the challenges of efficacy, delivery and tolerability posed by intratumoral or intravenous injection of free (unconjugated) STING agonists. We have generated preclinical data across multiple, diverse targets by creating Immunosynthen ADCs based on a variety of antibodies directed to those targets and evaluating them in a range of tumor models. In each case, we have demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in vivo (including complete tumor regressions) after a single low, well-tolerated dose. Additional characterization has demonstrated increased cytokine expression and immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, as well as the induction of immunological memory. We have demonstrated tolerability and characterized the favorable pharmacokinetic profile of Immunosynthen ADCs in non-human primates after multiple intravenous doses and at exposures significantly higher than those required for robust efficacy in mice.
Immunosynthen ADCs have been designed to overcome the limitations of free STING agonists and to offer a highly differentiated approach from other innate immune activators due to the following:
•Non-Cell Permeable STING Agonist ImmunoLock Payload: Our novel and proprietary payload has very low cell permeability, remaining in the cell to which it is delivered by the antibody, where it can exert its effect.
•Enhanced Pharmacokinetic Properties: The prolonged pharmacokinetics of ADCs and active transport into tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells can overcome pharmacokinetic and permeability issues of the free agonists, resulting in more robust and sustained activation of the innate immune response in the tumor.
•Targeted Activation in Two Cell Types: Because STING, unlike other innate immune pathways, can be activated in tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells, target-dependent delivery can result in innate immune activation of both cell types, providing potent and robust anti-tumor responses and the induction of immunological memory.
Together these features have the potential to improve the applicable therapeutic index by selectively activating the innate immune system in the tumor environment and minimizing activation in other tissues. We are building a pipeline of Immunosynthen ADC candidates applicable to a broad range of clinical indications. In January 2023, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of our first Immunosynthen ADC product candidate, XMT-2056, which targets a novel epitope of HER2.
Our product candidates
We are leveraging our platforms to develop a robust pipeline of product candidates that have the potential to become clinically meaningful cancer therapies. Our pipeline strategy focuses on targets that have been biologically validated (either through ADCs or other modalities), where the advantages of our platforms may lead to clinically superior therapeutic benefits and where we have the potential to achieve first-in-class status by pursuing fast-to-market development strategies. Our lead product candidate, UpRi, is currently being evaluated in three clinical trials: UPLIFT, UP-NEXT and UPGRADE-A. We are also advancing XMT-1660, a B7-H4-targeted Dolasynthen ADC, and XMT-2056, our first Immunosynthen ADC targeting a novel epitope of HER2, both of which are currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. In addition, our collaborators have multiple ADC product candidates in various stages of development. In May 2022, we decided to discontinue development of XMT-1592, a Dolasynthen ADC targeting NaPi2b that had been in a Phase 1 dose exploration trial in patients with ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and we closed this company-sponsored trial in September 2022.
UpRi: our NaPi2b-targeted Dolaflexin ADC
UpRi, a first-in-class ADC targeting the sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein NaPi2b, utilizes the Dolaflexin platform to deliver about 10 DolaLock payload molecules per antibody. We believe the NaPi2b antigen is broadly expressed in ovarian cancer and other cancers with limited expression in normal tissue. NaPi2b is a member of the SLC34 family of sodium-dependent transporters and plays an important role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of UpRi in December 2017 with the primary objectives of determining the recommended Phase 2 dose and characterizing UpRi’s efficacy, safety and tolerability. Our secondary objective was to assess the potential correlation of NaPi2b biomarker expression and efficacy. The dose escalation portion of the trial established a dose of 43 mg/m2, up to a maximum of approximately 80 mg, as the maximum tolerated dose. The expansion portion of the trial evaluated two dose levels, 36 mg/m2 and 43 mg/m2, up to a maximum of approximately 80 mg.
There are currently no tests approved by the FDA to measure NaPi2b expression on tumor cells. While our initial clinical trials have not prospectively identified patients with NaPi2b-expressing tumors, our development plan for UpRi includes the development of a proprietary immunohistochemistry assay to measure NaPi2b expression in tumors. Based on our retrospective evaluation of tumors collected in the dose escalation and expansion portions of our initial UpRi Phase 1 trial, our evaluation of patient tissue bank materials and other published data we believe that high NaPi2b expression is present in at least a majority of ovarian cancer patients. We intend to continue developing our assay in order to confirm our estimates of the prevalence of NaPi2b expression in our target patient populations while evaluating the correlation of those expression levels with the efficacy observed in such patients. We are currently collaborating with a third party to create and obtain regulatory approval for our assay as a commercial companion or complementary diagnostic, and we expect that the third party would seek such approval simultaneously with our submission of a BLA, if any, for UpRi around the end of 2023. We are using and expect to continue to use the assay to evaluate Tumor Proportion Score of greater than or equal to 75%, TPS75, to identify patients with tumors that have high NaPi2b tumor expression and to help us enrich our data analyses based on biomarker expression. We refer to patients with cancers with TPS75 as “NaPi2b positive.”
Over the course of 2020, we presented early Phase 1 UpRi clinical data, including presentations at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology and in company presentations to investors. These data were from the dose escalation and expansion portions of our UpRi Phase 1 trial, and they demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with a safety profile differentiated from those of first-generation ADCs. In August 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for UpRi for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer who have received up to three prior lines of systemic therapy or patients who have received four prior lines of systemic therapy regardless of platinum status. In January 2021, September 2021 and March 2022, we provided interim clinical data updates from our expansion cohort. The interim data presented in September 2021 and March 2022 was based on approximately 100 
10


ovarian cancer patients. All of the data from these patients were from our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. These data supported UpRi’s clinically meaningful activity in heavily pretreated ovarian cancer patients with an ORR of approximately 34%, including complete responses, in evaluable patients with NaPi2b positive tumors. The data also showed that UpRi was generally well tolerated without the severe toxicities commonly seen with other ADCs such as neutropenia, ocular toxicities, or peripheral neuropathy. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events reported in this heavily pretreated trial population included fatigue and transiently increased aspartate aminotransferase. Other adverse events of clinical interest included infrequent, generally low-grade pneumonitis that generally resolves with dose reduction, delay, discontinuation and treatment with steroids. Based on these safety and efficacy data and our population pharmacokinetics analyses of the overall group of approximately 200 patients administered UpRi as of the data cut off, we determined that the Phase 2 recommended dose of UpRi is 36 mg/m2, up to a total dose of approximately 80 mg. This is the dose that we are currently evaluating in UPLIFT.
In April 2021, we initiated UPLIFT to enroll patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who had been treated with one to four prior lines of therapy, without regard to NaPi2b expression. In this trial, we are seeking to confirm the potentially predictive role of the Napi2b biomarker retrospectively using our novel diagnostic assay to identify NaPi2b positive patients. Patients who had been treated with three to four prior lines of therapy were able to enroll without prior bevacizumab treatment, accommodating differences in bevacizumab use in early disease. Additionally, patients who had experienced grade 1 or grade 2 neuropathy on previous treatments were eligible to enroll in UPLIFT. The primary endpoint is ORR in the NaPi2b positive patient population, and the secondary endpoints are ORR in the overall population, duration of response and safety. In October 2022, we completed the enrollment of approximately 270 patients in UPLIFT at sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. We expect to announce top-line data from UPLIFT in mid-2023 following the major oncology conferences scheduled for June. If we achieve positive results from UPLIFT, we believe that the trial may enable us to submit a BLA for UpRi for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with one to four prior lines of therapy under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway around the end of 2023.
In July 2021, we initiated UPGRADE-A, a Phase I open-label clinical trial in which we are evaluating the combination of UpRi and carboplatin, a standard platinum chemotherapy used to treat patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, in patients with platinum-sensitive high-grade serous ovarian cancer following one to three prior lines of treatment. Patients in the trial receive combination treatment every four weeks for six cycles followed by UpRi as a single-agent maintenance therapy. While patients in the trial are not preselected for NaPi2b-positive status, we are conducting a retrospective assessment of expression. We have completed the dose escalation portion of the trial, which investigated carboplatin combined with UpRi doses up to 36 mg/m2. There were no dose-limiting toxicities at any dose level. In January 2023, we initiated the dose expansion portion of UPGRADE-A, in which we are investigating a 30mg/m2 dose, up to a maximum of 66 mg, of UpRi. We expect to report interim data from UPGRADE-A in the second half of 2023. We believe data from UPGRADE-A will inform further development of UpRi both in combination with carboplatin and in combination with other therapies used in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, which we may explore in a series of UPGRADE trials.
We continue to enroll patients in our UP-NEXT clinical trial, for which we initiated patient dosing in late 2022. The design of UP-NEXT was informed by discussions with the FDA and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. UP-NEXT is enrolling recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who have achieved an objective response or stable disease after platinum therapy. Eligible patients with BRCA mutation must have received prior treatment with poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor therapy. Additionally, eligible patients must have NaPi2b positive tumor expression. Due to the lack of a standard of care for patients in the recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance setting, the trial is randomized against placebo and is investigating a 30 mg/m2 dose, up to a maximum of 66 mg, of UpRi. We believe that if the data from the trial is positive, UP-NEXT could serve as a post-approval confirmatory trial in the United States, support potential approvals outside of the United States and support the expansion of UpRi into earlier lines of therapy.
XMT-1660: our B7-H4-targeted Dolasynthen ADC candidate
XMT-1660 is our B7-H4-targeted ADC created with our Dolasynthen platform and equipped with our DolaLock payload designed for differentiated tolerability without severe neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy or ocular toxicities associated with other anti-tubulin payloads. We believe the expression profile of B7-H4, is well suited for our unique DolaLock payload. B7-H4 can be expressed on tumor cells and on immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages, or TAMs, which may lead to additional processing of the ADC and more payload in the tumor environment. We believe DolaLock’s direct cytotoxic effect, as well as its immunostimulatory effect through immunogenic cell death and dendritic cell activation, are well suited to the biology of the B7-H4 target. We have generated favorable preclinical efficacy data and non-human primate tolerability data with Dolasynthen ADCs targeting B7-H4 with precise DARs of 2 and 6. We selected the DAR6 variant based on these preclinical data, as well as a comparison to preclinical data generated with a B7-H4 Dolaflexin ADC with a DAR of approximately 12. We believe that targeting B7-H4 with XMT-1660 provides significant opportunities for development in areas of high unmet need. We are currently investigating XMT-1660 in a multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers. 
XMT-2056: our First Immunosynthen ADC candidate
XMT-2056 is our first Immunosynthen STING-agonist ADC. As described above, the therapeutic rationale of an Immunosynthen ADC is to selectively deliver the STING agonist to tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells in a target-dependent manner while avoiding delivery to healthy tissues. XMT-2056 is designed to offer a differentiated and complementary therapeutic approach to the treatment of HER2-expressing tumors. XMT-2056 targets a novel HER2 epitope that is distinct from the epitopes targeted by trastuzumab or pertuzumab, providing an opportunity for development as a monotherapy as well as in combination with well-established or investigational anti-HER2 agents. In preclinical studies, XMT-2056 was generally well-tolerated in non-human primate studies with no adverse findings in clinical pathology or histopathology after repeat doses as high as 36 mg/kg. In January 2023, we initiated a multicenter Phase 1 open-label clinical trial of XMT-2056 in patients with advanced/recurrent solid tumors expressing HER2, including breast, gastric, colorectal and NSCLC.
Ovarian cancer unmet need and epidemiology
According to the World Cancer Research Fund International, in 2020, the incidence of ovarian cancer worldwide was approximately 314,000, with the disease causing an estimated 207,000 deaths. With a U.S. incidence of approximately 20,000 and mortality of 13,000 in 2022 according to the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, ovarian cancer was the second most common gynecologic malignancy and the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States. Diagnosis is made histologically, and evaluation is commonly performed following surgical removal of an ovary or fallopian tube or biopsies of the peritoneum. The ovarian cancer standard of care is characterized by initial surgery followed by platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by either observation or maintenance treatment. Approximately 80% of ovarian cancer patients typically relapse following initial treatment. Subsequent treatment depends on the duration of response to initial platinum treatment. Ovarian cancer patients who progress within six months of completion of platinum-based therapy are considered to have platinum-resistant disease. Unmet medical need is significant for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer as treatment options are mainly limited to single-agent chemotherapies such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan or paclitaxel. Multiple Phase 3 trials of single agent chemotherapies in patients with platinum-resistant disease and one to three prior therapies have exhibited an overall response rate of 4-12% and median progression-free survival of 3-4 months. In 2022, mirvetuximab soravtansine was approved under an accelerated approval pathway in the United States for patients with FRα positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens. Only a minority of ovarian cancer patients are FRα positive, and the unmet need remains high for the majority of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. In addition, mirvetuximab soravtansine is associated with significant toxicities, including a boxed warning for ocular toxicity.
With targeted agents approved in platinum-resistant disease increasingly being prescribed in earlier lines of therapy, the unmet need in later lines is expected to remain severe. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is indicated in the United States to treat a subset of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients with no more than two prior therapies, but it is not always well-tolerated and has not shown an overall survival benefit. Use of bevacizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy in the frontline and platinum-sensitive recurrent settings means an increasing number of platinum-resistant patients are pre-treated with bevacizumab. Previously, PARP inhibitors had been approved for heavily pretreated ovarian cancer including platinum-resistant disease. Recently, the indications for PARP inhibitors in the United States were changed so that they are no longer approved for use in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. They are currently approved only for use as maintenance treatment in the frontline or platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer setting, in patients who are responding to platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, they are increasingly restricted to use in a subset of patients with cancers harboring BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the recurrent setting. 
Breast cancer unmet need and epidemiology
Worldwide, breast cancer was the most common cancer, with an incidence of approximately 2.3 million and estimated 685,000 deaths in 2020. The U.S. incidence was approximately 288,000 new cases with approximately 43,250 deaths in 2022. While patients with localized disease typically have a relatively good prognosis, the five-year survival of patients with distant metastasis is only 29%. There are four main female breast cancer subtypes, which are, in order of prevalence: Hormone Receptor, or HR, positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (HER2-), which is referred to as Luminal A; HR negative (HR-)/HER2-, which is referred to as Triple Negative; HR+/HER2 positive (HER+), which is referred to as Luminal B; and HR-/HER2+, which is referred to as HER2-enriched. This categorization of patients is being revisited given the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer in 2022. Treatment choice is driven by both subtype and stage of disease. Surgical resection offers the best opportunity for long-term survival and cure in patients with resectable early-stage disease. Some patients receive radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy post-surgery, with treatment choice driven by cancer subtype. 
Systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Once again, the treatment choice is determined by cancer subtype and by what treatments patients have received previously. The primary treatment option for patients who are HR+ is endocrine therapy, including aromatase inhibitors. Patients who are HER2+ are usually treated with HER2-targeting agents such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, among others. In 2022, the HER2 targeting therapy trastuzumab deruxtecan was approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. Other targeted agents that are used in metastatic breast cancer include CDK4/6 inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or PI3K, inhibitors, immunotherapy and ADCs. Patients can also receive chemotherapies, alone or in combination with other agents. In addition, a number of new therapeutic options are under clinical investigation. Despite the availability of these treatment options, outcomes in metastatic breast cancer continue to be poor, and new treatments that improve survival and quality of life are urgently needed.
Strategic Collaborations
We view business development as a core pillar of our overall corporate strategy, and our platforms and product candidates allow us to consider multiple potential types of strategic collaborations. We believe that our ADC platforms have broad applicability across a number of targets, allowing us to consider collaborations in which a partner provides proprietary antibodies for a select number of targets and we utilize our platforms to discover novel ADC product candidates. Under these collaboration agreements, we own the rights to any improvements to our ADC platform(s). For instance, we have entered into two discovery collaborations with Merck KGaA and a separate discovery collaboration with Janssen. We believe platform-based collaborations allow us to leverage the potential of our platforms, provide near-term capital and help us potentially bring important new therapeutic options to patients.
We also have internally developed ADC product candidates that allow us to consider arrangements in which a collaborator may assume certain preclinical, clinical and/or commercial responsibilities. For instance, we have granted GSK an exclusive option for an exclusive global license to co-develop and commercialize XMT-2056. We believe product-focused collaborations could provide near-term funding, allow us to advance and broaden preclinical, clinical or commercial development efforts beyond those we could independently, and potentially bring new therapeutic options to patients.
2022 Merck KGaA Collaboration
In December 2022, we entered into a collaboration and commercial license agreement with Ares Trading S.A., or MRKDG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck KGaA, or the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement, we will grant MRKDG an exclusive license to use our proprietary technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize Immunosynthen ADCs directed to up to two specific target antigens, or the Designated Targets, selected by MRKDG within a certain period following the effectiveness of the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement. MRKDG has already selected the first Designated Target under the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement.
Under the terms of the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement, the parties will conduct up to two research programs. Each research program will involve activities related to Immunosynthen ADCs for a selected Target (with each such ADC developed under the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement being a Licensed ADC) until the submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, (or foreign equivalents) for a Licensed ADC directed at such Designated Target, or each an MRKDG Licensed Product, or until the earlier expiration of the defined research period. Each research program will follow a research plan agreed between the parties. For each Designated Target, MRKDG is responsible for providing up to a specified number of antibodies against such Designated Target, and we are responsible for conjugating such antibodies using our Immunosynthen platform to create Licensed ADCs. Each party will be responsible for their own costs under the research programs. In addition, we will be responsible for certain chemistry, manufacturing and controls development and certain manufacturing activities for the Licensed ADCs, up to and including manufacturing of drug substance for Licensed ADCs to be used in certain preclinical studies and clinical trials, in each case at MRKDG’s expense, some of which will be prepaid by MRKDG. Except as provided above, MRKDG is solely responsible for in vitro and in vivo characterization of any Licensed ADCs, other preclinical work, and all clinical development and potential commercialization activities relating to any resulting MRKDG Licensed Products.
Under the terms of the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in February 2023. Certain development and regulatory milestones will be payable by MRKDG to us for the research programs, including upon certain discovery milestones, initiation of certain clinical trials, and regulatory approval of MRKDG Licensed Products in certain geographies, with an aggregate total of up to $200 million in the event MRKDG advances MRKDG Licensed Products directed to both Designated Targets to regulatory approval.
In the event the commercialization of the MRKDG Licensed Product results in commercial sales, commercial milestones will be payable by MRKDG to us for each program upon the achievement of specified aggregate sales thresholds for an MRKDG Licensed Product for the applicable Designated Target, with an aggregate total of up to $600 million in the event MRKDG Licensed Products directed to both Designated Targets are commercialized by MRKDG. In addition, we are eligible to receive 
tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the single digits to the low double digits on future net sales of MRKDG Licensed Products.
MRKDG’s royalty obligations continue with respect to each country and each MRKDG Licensed Product until the latest of (i) the date on which such MRKDG Licensed Product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights in such country, (ii) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such MRKDG Licensed Product in such country and (iii) the expiration of marketing or data exclusivity for such MRKDG Licensed Product in such country.
Under the terms of the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and for an agreed period of time, we will not, either ourselves or through third parties, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize other ADCs utilizing our Immunosynthen platform that are directed to the Designated Targets. We and MRKDG will form a joint research committee, joint manufacturing committee, and joint intellectual property committee responsible for coordinating activities pursuant to the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement.
Each party has the right to sublicense its rights under the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement subject to certain conditions. The 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement will continue, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the last MRKDG Licensed Product or, if MRKDG does not advance any MRKDG Licensed Products, upon the expiration of the last-to-expire research program. MRKDG may, at its convenience, terminate the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement in its entirety or on a Designated Target-by-Designated Target basis upon certain notice to us. Either we or MRKDG may terminate the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement for the other party’s insolvency or certain uncured breaches. In lieu of terminating the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement, in the event MRKDG is entitled to terminate the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement due to our uncured material breach, MRKDG may make an election, as its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to our applicable material breach of the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement, to invoke a specified financial penalty impacting one or more future payments that may become payable to us following such uncured material breach. We may terminate the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement with respect to a Designated Target in the event of certain failures by MRKDG to progress the corresponding research program. Additionally, we may terminate the 2022 Merck KGaA Agreement if MRKDG or any of its sublicensees or affiliates challenge, subject to certain exceptions, the validity, enforceability, of patentability of certain of our patents.
GSK Collaboration
In August 2022, we entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement with GSK, or the GSK Agreement, to provide GSK with an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive global license to co-develop and to commercialize products containing XMT-2056, or Licensed Products, exercisable within a specified time period, or the Option Period, after we deliver to GSK a data package, or the Option Data Package, resulting from completion of dose escalation with enrichment for breast cancer patients in a Phase 1 single-agent clinical trial of XMT-2056. GSK’s exercise of the Option may require clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or HSR Clearance. Upon GSK’s exercise of the Option following any applicable HSR Clearance, or the GSK Option Exercise, GSK is obligated to pay us an option exercise payment of $90.0 million.
We will lead research and development activities related to our XMT-2056 program prior to the GSK Option Exercise, if any, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to generate the Option Data Package by an agreed time. Prior to the GSK Option Exercise, we will be responsible for the costs of manufacturing, research and early clinical development activities related to the XMT-2056 program.
Following the GSK Option Exercise, if any, GSK may elect to manufacture XMT-2056, and we and GSK will co-develop XMT-2056 in accordance with a joint development plan to be established by the parties and aimed at approval of Licensed Products in the United States and the European Union, with GSK being responsible for the majority of the development activities and costs. GSK will be responsible for all of the development costs aimed solely at gaining approval outside the United States and the European Union. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the GSK Agreement, our aggregate share of U.S.- and E.U.-focused development costs pursuant to this cost-sharing arrangement is capped at a fixed amount, or the Mersana Development Cost Cap. We may also, subject to certain limitations provided in the GSK Agreement, elect to opt out of sharing in development costs for certain later-stage clinical trials of Licensed Products requested by GSK, subject to certain payment obligations in the event that data from any such later-stage clinical trial for which we have opted out of sharing in development costs results in certain marketing approvals for a Licensed Product in the United States or European Union, or a Deemed Buy-In Payment. Any development costs in excess of the Mersana Development Cost Cap, including any amounts arising from any Deemed Buy-In Payments, will be borne by GSK unless and until we exercise our Profit Share Election (as defined below). Development costs in excess of the Mersana Development Cost Cap will accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus a specified margin and will later either be repaid by us or offset against future regulatory and sales milestone or royalty payments that may become due to us. If we exercise our Profit Share Election, the Mersana Development Cost Cap will no longer apply, we must pay any then-outstanding excess plus accrued interest, and we shall continue to share in further U.S.- and E.U.-focused development costs.
Following the GSK Option Exercise, if any, we will have the option, during a specified time period following our receipt of certain later-stage clinical data and other data and information from GSK, to elect to receive (or bear) a specified share of U.S. profits (or losses) for any Licensed Products, or the Profit Share Election. Additionally, if we exercise our Profit Share Election, we may also simultaneously elect to co-promote any Licensed Products in the United States. The co-promotion arrangement may be terminated by either party, notwithstanding the continued effectiveness of the rest of the GSK Agreement, in the event of certain breaches by the other party, or by GSK, in the event of certain specified changes of control of Mersana. In addition, in the event of certain specified changes of control of Mersana, GSK can prohibit us from executing development activities that are initiated under the GSK Agreement following such change of control.
We received an upfront payment of $100 million from GSK for the Option. We are eligible to receive up to $30 million upon satisfaction of early clinical development milestones that may occur prior to the GSK Option Exercise. Subject to the GSK Option Exercise, if we do not exercise our Profit Share Election, we will be eligible to receive additional future clinical development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $592 million, commercial milestone payments of up to $652 million and tiered double-digit royalties up to the mid-twenty percent range on global sales of Licensed Products, if approved, subject to customary reductions. If we exercise our Profit Share Election, we will, in lieu of the foregoing regulatory and commercial milestone amounts, be eligible to receive reduced regulatory and commercial milestone payments and reduced royalty rates on sales outside of the United States. Additionally, whether or not we exercise our Profit Share Election, GSK will be responsible for certain milestone payments or royalties due to specified third parties with which we currently have agreements that relate to the XMT-2056 program.
GSK’s royalty obligations continue with respect to each country and each Licensed Product until the latest of (i) the date on which such Licensed Product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights in such country, (ii) the 12th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such Licensed Product in such country.
Under the terms of the GSK Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and for an agreed period of time, we and GSK will not, either directly or through third parties, develop or commercialize other products or compounds that (a) comprise or contain an ADC that is conjugated with a STING agonist and (b) are directed to HER2. In addition, we have granted GSK a right of first negotiation for future ADCs that are conjugated to payloads other than STING agonists and directed to HER2. Following the GSK Option Exercise, if any, we and GSK will form a joint steering committee, joint development committee, joint manufacturing committee, joint commercialization committee, and financial working group responsible for coordinating all activities under the GSK Agreement, with GSK having final decision-making authority over most issues, subject to certain enumerated exceptions.
The GSK Agreement will terminate at the end of the Option Period if GSK does not exercise its Option. If GSK exercises its Option but we do not obtain HSR Clearance within specified time periods following the latest date on which the parties have made their respective applicable filings related to such HSR Clearance, each party has a right to terminate the GSK Agreement. In the event of the GSK Option Exercise, the GSK Agreement will continue in effect on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the obligation to make payments under the GSK Agreement with respect to such Licensed Product in such country, unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the GSK Agreement. Either we or GSK may terminate the GSK Agreement for the other party’s insolvency, and each party may terminate the GSK Agreement for certain uncured breaches by the other party. In lieu of terminating the GSK Agreement, in the event of certain uncured material breaches by us, GSK may make a one-time election, in addition to other contractual remedies available at law or in equity, to invoke a specified financial penalty impacting one or more future payments that may become payable to the Company following such uncured material breach. We may terminate GSK’s license to certain of our patents if GSK or any of its sublicensees or affiliates challenge the validity, enforceability, of patentability of such patents. GSK may terminate the GSK Agreement for convenience upon certain notice to us.
Janssen Collaboration 
In February 2022, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Janssen, or the Janssen Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Janssen an exclusive license to use our proprietary Dolasynthen platform and other technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize antibody-drug conjugates directed to up to three targets selected by Janssen. Our responsibilities are to perform bioconjugation activities to create ADCs for Janssen based on antibodies provided by Janssen. We will also perform certain chemistry, manufacturing and controls development and early stage manufacturing activities for ADCs that Janssen progresses through development, up to and including the manufacturing of clinical drug substance, at Janssen’s cost. Except with respect to this limited manufacturing, Janssen will be responsible for the further development, manufacturing and commercialization of the ADCs developed under the Janssen Agreement, including obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals, at Janssen’s cost.
Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $40 million. Certain development and regulatory milestones will also be payable by Janssen for the research programs, including upon certain discovery milestones, initiation of certain clinical trials, and regulatory approval of certain licensed products in certain geographies, with an aggregate total of up to $501 million in the event ADCs directed to all three targets are advanced by Janssen. In the event the ADCs developed by Janssen are commercialized, we are eligible to receive certain commercial milestones for each program upon the achievement of specified aggregate sales thresholds based on all ADCs for an applicable target, with an aggregate total of up to approximately $530 million in the event ADCs directed to all three targets are commercialized by Janssen. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits on future net sales of ADCs.
The Janssen Agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the last ADC. Royalty term means on an ADC-by-ADC and country-by-country basis, the period commencing upon the first commercial sale of an ADC in such country and ending upon the latest to occur of: (a) the date of expiration of the last royalty-bearing patent claim with respect to such ADC in such country; (b) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such ADC in such country, if any; and (c) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first commercial sale of such ADC in such country. Upon the expiration of the royalty term with respect to an ADC in a country, Janssen’s license becomes a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free right and license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the relevant platform technology and our interest in any joint technology to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit such ADC in such country.
2014 Merck KGaA Collaboration
In June 2014, we entered into a collaboration and commercial license agreement with Merck KGaA, or the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement, under which we formed a strategic relationship with Merck KGaA because of their expertise in oncology drug development. Under the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement, we are responsible for generating ADC product candidates against Merck KGaA-selected target antigens. Merck KGaA received rights to select up to six target antigens, of which it has selected all six. Merck KGaA is responsible for generating antibodies against the target antigens, and we are responsible for generating Dolaflexin and conjugating this to such antibodies to create the ADC product candidates. With respect to each target antigen selected by Merck KGaA, we granted Merck KGaA an exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our Fleximer ADC-related patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize ADC product candidates directed to such target antigen. Merck KGaA is then responsible for the further development and commercialization of these ADC product candidates. In addition, if Merck KGaA advances candidates, we are responsible for manufacturing these ADC product candidates for good laboratory practices toxicology studies and Phase 1 clinical trials at Merck KGaA’s expense and Merck KGaA is responsible for all further manufacture of these ADC product candidates. Merck KGaA is required to pay its own costs in the development, commercialization and manufacture of these ADC product candidates and to reimburse us for our costs incurred in performing our research activities under this agreement.
Through December 31, 2022, we have received an upfront payment of $12 million and milestone payments of $3 million under the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement. If products are successfully developed and commercialized against all six target antigens, we would be entitled to receive future development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $777 million. We are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on net sales of products targeting Merck KGaA’s target antigens during the applicable royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized by Merck KGaA under the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement.
Unless earlier terminated, the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for a product under the agreement in all countries or, if Merck KGaA does not designate any ADC product candidates produced by us under the agreement as preclinical development candidates, upon the expiration of the last-to-expire research program. The royalty term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period commencing upon the first commercial sale of a product and ending upon the later to occur of: (i) the expiration of the last Mersana patent right that covers or claims the exploitation of such product in such country, or (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term for each product on a country-by-country basis, Merck KGaA’s exclusive license will convert to a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license with respect to such product in such country. Merck KGaA may terminate the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any target antigen for convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Each party may terminate the 2014 Merck KGaA Agreement in its entirety upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party.
Asana Biosciences Collaboration
In March 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Asana Biosciences, or Asana (by assignment from Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we used Asana’s novel antibodies to develop novel ADCs using our Fleximer technology. Asana is responsible for product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any ADC products.
Strategic relationships to access antibodies and develop new platforms to progress our proprietary pipeline
Our focus is to progress our proprietary pipeline of ADCs. For this reason, we have collaborated with biotechnology companies that have the capability to generate high quality antibodies or that have existing antibodies that we can license for inclusion in our ADCs. We have also entered into license agreements with biotechnology companies that own certain patent rights and related know-how that enable us to develop new ADC platforms. These strategic relationships have facilitated the advancement of our proprietary pipeline.
Recepta license for the NaPi2b antibody
In July 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Recepta Biopharma S.A., or Recepta, a Brazilian biopharmaceutical company, licensing Recepta’s NaPi2b antibody for use in UpRi and our former product candidate XMT-1592 and granting Recepta the exclusive right to commercialize UpRi and XMT-1592 in Brazil, which was amended in September 2021. We refer to this as the Recepta License. Under the Recepta License, Recepta granted us an exclusive license and sub-license with respect to certain patents licensed by Recepta from Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and technology owned by Recepta to develop and exploit products containing Recepta’s NaPi2b antibody, including UpRi and XMT-1592, worldwide for the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of human cancer. We granted Recepta an exclusive license under our rights in such patents and technology and certain of our ADC-related patents and technology to commercialize any such products developed by us, including UpRi and XMT-1592, in Brazil. We are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products under the Recepta License globally, with at least one trial site in our Phase 3 clinical trials, and at our own expense in certain major markets. Recepta may conduct development activities in Brazil at its own expense after providing us the opportunity to first conduct such activities at Recepta’s expense. If a product is successfully developed and commercialized by Recepta in Brazil, we will use diligent efforts to enter into an agreement for the supply of such products to Recepta for sale in Brazil.
Under the Recepta License, we paid Recepta an upfront payment of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and are obligated to pay Recepta up to $65.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered royalties in the low-single digit percentages on net sales of products outside of Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized. We have incurred and paid $4.0 million in development milestones. We are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on net sales of products in Brazil until the expiration of the royalty term if products are successfully developed and commercialized. The royalty term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period ending upon the later of (i) with respect to products commercialized by Mersana, the expiration of the last-to-expire Recepta patent that covers the product in such country (including the term of any applicable supplementary protection certificate) or with respect to products commercialized by Recepta, the expiration of the last-to-expire Mersana patent that covers the product in Brazil (including the term of any applicable supplementary protection certificate) or (ii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon the expiration of each royalty term in each country for each applicable product, the exclusive licenses granted to each party under the agreement will become fully-paid up and royalty-free. The Recepta License will remain in effect until otherwise terminated as set forth below. We may terminate the Recepta License for convenience in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis (except with respect to Brazil) or product-by-product basis upon 180 days’ prior written notice for a termination in its entirety or upon 45 days’ prior written notice for a termination in part. Each party may terminate the Recepta License in its entirety upon bankruptcy or similar proceedings of the other party, upon a patent challenge by the other party or upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party. However, if such breach only relates to one country, the Recepta License may only be terminated with respect to such country.
Synaffix commercial license agreement    
In January 2019, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Synaffix B.V., or Synaffix, which we amended and restated in November 2021 to expand our relationship with Synaffix and amended again in February 2022 in connection with our collaboration with Janssen. We refer to the amended and restated agreement as the Synaffix License. Under the Synaffix License, we have the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize ADCs directed to targets using Synaffix’s proprietary site-specific conjugation technology for up to twelve targets. We have licensed five targets in connection with our development programs and collaborations, and we have the right to license up to six additional targets. We have paid $6.8 million related to 
the Synaffix License, comprised of $4.0 million in reservation and license fees, $1.8 million in milestone payments and $1.0 million which may be applied to future reservation and license fees, as well as certain portions of potential future development milestones. We will be obligated to pay in the range of $48.0 million to $132.0 million for development, regulatory and commercial milestones.
Upon commencement of commercial sales of any ADC product directed to a licensed target, if any, we are required to pay to Synaffix tiered royalties in the low-single digit percentages on net sales of the respective products. The Synaffix License remains in effect on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in a patent licensed under the Synaffix License covering such product in such country. Upon the expiration of the Synaffix License for each licensed product in each country, the licenses granted to us for such product in such country will become fully paid-up and perpetual. We may terminate the Synaffix License in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis at any time. Either party may terminate the Synaffix License, subject to a specified notice and cure period, for a breach by the other party of a material provision of the agreement or upon an insolvency-related event experienced by the other party.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate and currently have no plans to establish any current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on external Contract Manufacturing Organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of product to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing. We have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for the relationships with our CMOs. In the future, we expect to use these CMOs to manufacture commercial supply of our products, which will require these CMOs to increase scale of production. We do not currently have qualified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs that we utilize are unable to scale production for commercial manufacturing. The Dolaflexin, Dolasynthen and Immunosynthen manufacturing processes involve readily available starting materials and use unit operations that are well-precedented in the field of chemical/pharmaceutical production. The current UpRi supply chain utilizes the same vendors that we could use for commercialization. The current supply chains for XMT-1660 and XMT-2056 have several vendors in common, and based on what we know today, we believe we could use these vendors or would be able to identify and contract with other vendors on commercially reasonable terms for commercialization purposes.
Government regulation
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, record-keeping, distribution, import, export, promotion, advertising, marketing, sale, pricing and reimbursement of drug and biologic products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, both pre-approval and post-approval, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to biological product development, approval and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business.
U.S. government regulation of biological products
In the United States, the FDA licenses biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulates such products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor. A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations or other applicable regulations;
•design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated when certain changes are made;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including payment of application user fees;
•review of the BLA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA, which may be subject to additional post- approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post- approval clinical trials required by the FDA.
Preclinical studies
Before a sponsor begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. These studies are often referred to as IND-enabling studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. An IND must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may proceed. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical investigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical trial subjects. 
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial data as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects. GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. 
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and re-approve the trial at least annually. The IRB, which must operate in compliance with FDA regulations, must review and approve, among other things, the clinical trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects and must monitor the trial until completed. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on review of available data from the trial, to which only the DSMB maintains access. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of a clinical trial can occur if the DSMB determines that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
Expanded access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational products for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational product for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access; however, as required by amendments to the FDCA included in the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests with respect to product candidates in development to treat serious diseases or conditions, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial for a covered investigational product; or 15 days after the investigational product receives designation from the FDA as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
Human clinical trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before they participate in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. The FDA has issued regulations authorizing a sponsor to transfer certain responsibilities for the conduct of a clinical trial to a contract research organization, or CRO.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional trials may also be required after approval. 
Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population, which may be healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease, to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled and closely monitored. 
Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken using a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a new biologic product. Such Phase 3 clinical trials are referred to as “pivotal” trials. 
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the trial will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials, typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials, such as to verify clinical benefit in the case of products approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of FDA approval for products. In December 2022, with the passage of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, action plans must include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.
In March 2022, the FDA released final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. 
Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to product development and reduce developmental costs and time.Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the long delay of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, in issuing final implementing regulations, those regulations have now been issued and the FDA has issued several Notices of Noncompliance to manufacturers since April 2021. 
Interactions with FDA during the clinical development program
Following the clearance of an IND and the commencement of clinical trials, the sponsor will continue to have interactions with the FDA. Progress reports detailing the results of clinical trials must be submitted annually within 60 days of the anniversary dates that the IND went into effect and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. These reports must include a development safety update report, or DSUR. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other trials or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the occurrence of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
In addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program. Specifically, sponsors may meet with the FDA prior to the submission of an IND (Pre-IND meeting), at the end of Phase 2 clinical trial (EOP2 meeting) and before a BLA is submitted (Pre-BLA meeting). Meetings at other times may also be requested. There are four types of meetings that occur between sponsors and the FDA. Type A meetings are those that are necessary for an otherwise stalled product development program to proceed or to address an important safety issue. Type B meetings include pre-IND and pre-BLA meetings, as well as end of phase meetings such as EOP2 meetings. A Type C meeting is any meeting other than a Type A or Type B meeting regarding the development and review of a product, including for example meetings to facilitate early consultations on the use of a biomarker as a new surrogate endpoint that has never been previously used as the primary basis for product approval in the proposed context of use. Finally, a Type D meeting is focused on a narrow set of issues, which should be limited to no more than two focused topics, and should not require input from more than three disciplines or divisions. 
Manufacturing and other regulatory requirements
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Specifically, the FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that foreign drug manufacturing establishments are subject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug or biologic undergoes further manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing at a separate establishment outside the United States prior to being imported or offered for import into the United States. 
Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often 
require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product. 
Pediatric trials
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, applications and certain types of supplements to applications must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric clinical trial or trials that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric trials along with supporting information. The sponsor and the FDA must reach agreement on a final plan. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial PSP or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after the FDA’s receipt of the PSP.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The law now requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
Expedited review programs 
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of applications in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
•Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review. 
•Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared 
to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review. 
•Accelerated approval. Biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
With passage of FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to: require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated approval is awarded; require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-approval studies to the FDA every six months, until the study is completed; and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of a new drug application or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit. Further, FDORA requires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval. 
•Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
None of these expedited programs changes the standards for approval but each may help expedite the development or approval process governing product candidates.
Submission and filing of BLAs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, safety updates, patent information, abuse information and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, potency and purity of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The fee required for the submission and review of an application under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, is substantial (for example, for FY2023 this application fee is approximately $3.25 million), and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $394,000 per eligible prescription product. These fees are typically adjusted annually, and exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, including where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the applicant. Typically, an RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information or sections of required information such that substantive and meaningful review is precluded. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, 
whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the filing date for an application with “priority review.” The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date.
In connection with its review of an application, the FDA will typically submit information requests to the applicant and set deadlines for responses thereto. The FDA will also conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND and GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. With passage of FDORA, Congress clarified the FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspections of facilities involved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to the FDA as well as other persons holding study records or involved in the study process.
Additionally, the FDA may refer an application, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. 
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS.
Decisions on BLAs
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the expected benefits of the proposed product outweigh its potential risks to patients. This assessment is informed by the severity of the underlying condition and how well patients’ medical needs are addressed by currently available therapies; uncertainty about how the premarket clinical trial evidence will extrapolate to real-world use of the product in the post-market setting; and whether risk management tools are necessary to manage specific risks.
A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the applicant an additional six month extension to respond. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to 
monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-approval requirements
Following approval of a new prescription product, the manufacturer, the approved product and the product’s manufacturing locations are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, governing, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product and product problems to the FDA, product sampling and distribution, manufacturing and promotion and advertising. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label uses”), manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a biologic.
It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in non-promotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval. Previously, such communications were permitted under FDA guidance but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, including unapproved uses of approved products.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products, as well as adverse public relations and reputational harm. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the sponsor may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new application or supplement, which may require the sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such trials are conducted, the FDA may not approve any expansion of the labeled indications for use in a timely fashion, or at all. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements that are now assessed as program fees for certain products.
In addition, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market clinical trials requirement to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. 
Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about a product;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;
•fines, warning letters, untitled letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs.
Regulatory exclusivity governing biologics
When a biological product is licensed for marketing by FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for a product that is “biosimilar to” a previously approved biological product, which the statute refers to as a “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The biosimilar sponsor may demonstrate that its product is biosimilar to the reference product on the basis of data from analytical studies, animal studies and one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. 
For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find not only that the product is biosimilar to the reference product but also that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product such that the two products may be switched without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. Following approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product, the FDA may not grant interchangeability status for any second biosimilar until one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar product. Congress clarified through FDORA that the FDA may approve multiple first interchangeable biosimilar biological products so long as the products are all approved on the first day on which such a product is approved as interchangeable with the reference product. 
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, however, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the product for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and potentially market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives 
orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first approved product. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
The period of market exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the disease or condition for which the product has been designated. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drug products that received orphan drug designation before enactment of amendments to the FDCA in 2017 but have not yet been approved by FDA.
In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. On January 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.
Pediatric exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of exclusivity. For biologic products, the six month period may be attached to any existing regulatory exclusivities but not to any patent terms. The conditions for pediatric exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new product in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the sponsor agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patents that cover the product are extended by six months. Although this is not a patent term extension, it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Patent term restoration and extension
In the United States, a patent claiming a new product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one‑half the time between the effective date of the IND involving human beings and the submission date of the BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Companion diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the therapeutic product and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.
The 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND application alone, or both an IND- and IDE-application.
In April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance which describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple biological oncology products, when appropriate. This guidance builds upon existing policy regarding the labeling of companion diagnostics. In its 2014 guidance, the FDA stated that if evidence is sufficient to conclude that the companion diagnostic is appropriate for use with a specific group of therapeutic products, the companion diagnostic’s intended use/indications for use should name the specific group of therapeutic products, rather than specific products. The 2020 guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by recommending that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors when determining whether their test could be developed, or the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)).
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require pre-notification marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2023, the standard fee is $441,547 and the small business fee is $110,387.
Healthcare compliance
In the United States, biopharmaceutical manufacturers and their products are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state level, such as laws intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to healthcare providers and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including certain laws and regulations applicable only if we have marketed products, include the following:
•federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid; 
•federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing or ordering of, a good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
•federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; 
•federal Open Payments (or federal “sunshine” law), which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with certain healthcare providers to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the HHS for re-disclosure to the public, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws; state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict financial interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments to health care providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing privacy, security and breaches of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and
•laws and regulations prohibiting bribery and corruption such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which, among other things, prohibits U.S. companies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international organizations or foreign government-owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign public office, and foreign political parties or officials thereof.
Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Ensuring compliance is time consuming and costly. Similar healthcare laws and regulations exist in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers and laws governing the privacy and security of personal information.
Healthcare reform 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for medical products and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for pharmaceutical products under government healthcare programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031. These Medicare sequester reductions were suspended and reduced through the end of June 2022, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter.
Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new executive order that directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit access to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID‑19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and under the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
Pharmaceutical prices
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, the HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription products from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of products from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which has been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2026 by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Order directs the HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to 
promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments. 
More recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare beginning in 2026, with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation first due in 2023; and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program beginning in 2025. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. 
Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 additional Part D drugs in 2027, 15 additional Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 additional Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least nine years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require pharmaceutical manufacturers and other entities in the supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Federal and state data privacy laws
There are multiple privacy and data security laws that may impact our business activities, in the United States and in other countries where we conduct trials or where we may do business in the future. These laws are evolving and may increase both our obligations and our regulatory risks in the future. In the health care industry generally, under HIPAA, the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. HIPAA may apply to us in certain circumstances and may also apply to our business partners in ways that may impact our relationships with them. Our clinical trials are regulated by the Common Rule, which also includes specific privacy-related provisions. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that may be applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. State attorneys general also have authority to enforce state privacy and security laws. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.
At the state level, California has enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, effective starting on January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, significantly modified the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and individually identifiable health information. These provisions may apply to some of our business activities. In addition, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, already have passed state privacy laws and other states will likely be considering similar laws in the near future. 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the privacy or data security laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any product candidates we may develop, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Approval and regulation of medical products in the European Union
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 27-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
With the exception of the European Union and European Economic Area, or EEA, applying the harmonized regulatory rules for medicinal products, the approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Clinical trials
On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public. Beyond streamlining the process, the Clinical Trials Regulation includes a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors, and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, 
which is divided into two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted where EU Member States are concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each EU Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific clinical site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
Marketing authorization in the European Union
Marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, can be filed either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures, albeit through the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure for a product to be authorized in more than one EU Member State.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are part of the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/ AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, a sponsor may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The sponsor may choose a member state as the reference member State to lead the scientific evaluation of the application.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State (which acts as the reference member state), in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be progressively sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization produced by the reference member state.
Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Conditional approval
In particular circumstances, EU legislation (Article 14–a Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/5 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables sponsors to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for 
an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the product candidate is intended for the treatment, prevention or medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases; (2) the product candidate is intended to meet unmet medical needs of patients; (3) a marketing authorization may be granted prior to submission of comprehensive clinical data provided that the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required; (4) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, and (5) it is likely that the sponsor will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new clinical trials and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
Pediatric trials
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, sponsors have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate because (a) the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in part or all of the pediatric population; (b) the disease or condition occurs only in adult population; or (c) the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric population. Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
PRIME designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage product development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme, facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance to the sponsor on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Periods of authorization and renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least nine months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Regulatory requirements after marketing authorization 
As in the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, including compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the European Union. 
Regulatory exclusivity
In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic sponsors from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic sponsor from commercializing its product in the European Union until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life- threatening or chronically debilitating condition, (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The term ‘significant benefit’ is defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000 to mean a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care.
Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten year market exclusivity period, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA, cannot accept an application for a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The sponsor will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently 
profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: (1) the second sponsor can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the sponsor consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the sponsor cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Pediatric exclusivity
If a sponsor obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the trial results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, or alternatively a one year extension of the regulatory market exclusivity from ten to eleven years, as selected by the marketing authorization holder.
Patent term extensions
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a product. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country‑by‑country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
Reimbursement and pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals
In the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments to those in the United States may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the United States and the European Union, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, including those of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, pharmaceutical firms may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of the product to other available therapies.
Approval of companion diagnostic devices
In the European Union, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or SPRs, detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745), or MDR which came into force on May 26, 2021 and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with SPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark of Conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold. To demonstrate compliance with the SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the European Union for medical devices.
Separately, the regulatory authorities in the European Union also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, or IVDR, (EU) 2017/746, which became effective in May 2022. The new regulation replaces the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD) 98/79/EC. Manufacturers wishing to apply to a notified body for a conformity assessment of their in vitro diagnostic medical device had until May 2022 to update their Technical Documentation to meet the requirements and comply with the new, more stringent Regulation. The regulation, among other things, strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of devices placed on the market; improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
General Data Protection Regulation
Many countries outside of the United States maintain rigorous laws governing the privacy and security of personal information. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the EEA, and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, and it imposes heightened requirements on companies that process health and other sensitive data, such as requiring in many situations that a company obtain the consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive personal data relate before processing such data. Examples of obligations imposed by the GDPR on companies processing personal data that fall within the scope of the GDPR include providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, appointing a data protection officer, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors.
The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the United Kingdom and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR.
Additionally, in October 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which would serve as a replacement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The European Commission initiated the process to adopt an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework in December 2022. It is unclear if and when the framework will be finalized and whether it will be challenged in court. The uncertainty around this issue may further impact our business operations in the European Union.
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union took place on January 31, 2020. The European Union and the United Kingdom reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which became effective on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the European Union and the United Kingdom will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering the quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit may have a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom. For example, the United Kingdom is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market our product candidates in the United Kingdom. However, until December 31, 2023, it is possible for the MHRA to rely on a decision taken by the European Commission and EMA’s CHMP on the approval of MAA or variations via the centralized procedure, or the so called “Reliance Procedure.”
Intellectual property
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing patents that cover our ADC platforms, proprietary compositions of matter, ADC product candidates and methods of using and manufacturing the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.
Our commercial success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S., international (under Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT) and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we consider to be important to the development and implementation of our business. We also believe in protecting our unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing our technological innovation to develop our business and to maintain our competitive position.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any of our patents.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may currently own or license or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
As of December 31, 2022, we owned, in all of our patent portfolios, 24 issued U.S. patents, 18 pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications (including two allowed U.S. patent applications), seven pending provisional U.S. patent applications, 131 issued foreign patents, three pending PCT patent applications and 209 pending foreign patent applications (including three allowed foreign patent applications), in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Europe, Eurasia, Egypt, Gulf Cooperation Council, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Macau, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Our 10 issued U.S. patents covering our Fleximer ADC platform are projected to expire in 2032, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our two issued U.S. patents covering our Dolaflexin ADC platform are projected to expire in 2034 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our two issued U.S. patents covering UpRi are projected to expire in 2037 and 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our one issued U.S. patent covering our Dolasynthen ADC platform is projected to expire in 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our three issued U.S. patents covering our novel HER2 antibody are projected to expire in 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term 
extensions; our one issued U.S. patent covering our STING agonist payload is projected to expire in 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; our additional five issued U.S. patents are projected to expire between 2033 and 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions; and any patent that may issue from our pending U.S. applications are projected to expire between 2032 and 2043, in each case, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. In addition, we have exclusively in-licensed four issued U.S. patents and one issued European patent for the NaPi2b antibody from Recepta, which Recepta licensed from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. These in-licensed issued U.S. and European patents are projected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. Recepta still owns one pending Brazilian patent application for the NaPi2b antibody, which is not licensed to us. A patent issuing from this Brazilian patent application is projected to expire in 2029, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We have also non-exclusively in-licensed from Synaffix certain patents and patent applications for their proprietary site-specific conjugation technology. These in-licensed Synaffix patents and patent applications are eight issued US patents, three pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications, thirteen issued foreign patents, and 14 pending foreign patent applications, in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, China, Europe, India, Japan, and Netherlands These in-licensed issued U.S. and European patents are projected to expire from 2031 to 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before they are granted. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national or regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might in some jurisdictions be refused by the relevant registration authorities, while granted by others. It is also quite common that depending on the country, various scopes of patent protection may be granted on the same product candidate or technology.
The intellectual property portfolio of our ADC platforms, our ADC product candidates and components thereof, and companion or complementary diagnostics are summarized below. Some of these portfolios are in very early stages, and prosecution has yet to commence on some of the pending patent applications. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO may be narrowed (sometimes significantly) by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.

As of December 31, 2022, we owned one pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, three pending provisional U.S. patent applications and 23 pending foreign patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Europe, Eurasia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, New Zealand, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, South Africa, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the composition of matter of XMT-2056 is projected to expire in 2041, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering combinations comprising XMT-2056 is projected to expire in 2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, and any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the XMT-2056 dosing regimens is projected to expire in 2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
In addition to the above with respect to XMT-2056, as of December 31, 2022, we owned three issued U.S. patents, one pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, 19 issued foreign patents and seven pending foreign patent applications (including one allowed foreign patent application), in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Macau, Mexico, South Korea, New Zealand and Taiwan, directed to the novel HER2 antibody. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the pending applications covering the novel HER2 antibody is projected to expire in 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees and consultants, which agreements may also include appropriate non-competition and non-solicit agreements depending on level and role, as well as confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to our technology platforms, trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. For more information regarding the risks associated with our trade secrets, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property—Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.”
Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary ADC platforms and scientific expertise provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. These competitors generally fall within the following categories:
New cancer treatments: Many global pharmaceutical companies, as well as medium and small biotechnology companies, are pursuing new cancer treatments whether small molecules, biologics or ADCs. Any of these treatments could prove to be superior clinically to our products.
ADC platforms: Although Dolaflexin, Dolasynthen, Immunosynthen and certain initiatives we have underway are highly differentiated and proprietary, many companies continue to invest in innovation in the ADC field including new payload classes, new conjugation approaches and new targeting moieties. Any of these initiatives could lead to a platform that has superior properties to ours. We are also aware of multiple companies with ADC technologies that may be competitive to our platforms, including Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited; ImmunoGen, Inc.; Gilead Sciences, Inc.; Pfizer Inc.; and Seagen Inc. These companies or their partners and collaborators, including Astellas Pharma Inc.; AstraZeneca plc; AbbVie Inc.; Genentech, 
a member of the Roche Group; and Takeda, may develop product candidates that compete in the same indications as our current and future product candidates. Multiple companies are also developing ADCs that could compete with our Immunosynthen product candidates, including Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc. and Takeda, albeit with differing immune stimulating approaches. We expect to compete based on our innovative technology and the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of our ADCs compared to other product candidates, but if our ADCs are not demonstrably superior in these respects, we may not be able to compete effectively.
Ovarian cancer: The first indication that we are targeting for UpRi, our most advanced clinical candidate, is ovarian cancer. There are multiple therapies currently available to treat both newly diagnosed and relapsed ovarian cancer, including platinum agents, non-platinum chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, bevacizumab and mirvetuximab soravtansine. In addition, multiple investigational product candidates are in development to treat these ovarian cancer patients, including MORAb-202 (Eisai Co., Ltd. and BMS) and STRO-002 (Sutro Biopharma, Inc.), which are investigational ADCs. There are also ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials of agents and treatment modalities including Tumor Treating Fields (Novocure GmbH) and AVB-500 (Aravive, Inc.), which, if successful, could alter the treatment landscape for platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Our ability to compete effectively with these and other emerging ovarian cancer treatments will depend on our ability to differentiate UpRi from these other therapies based on target patient selection, efficacy and tolerability. If we are unable to effectively differentiate UpRi, this will negatively impact our ability to compete in ovarian cancer.
Breast Cancer: We are planning to evaluate two of our product candidates currently in clinical development, XMT-2056 and XMT-1660, in patients with breast cancer indications. Multiple therapies are currently available to treat metastatic breast cancer across newly diagnosed and relapsed settings, including but not limited to aromatase inhibitors, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, HER2-targeted therapies, anti-PD-1 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors and ADCs targeting HER2 and Trop-2. Additional classes of therapies currently in development include oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (known as SERDs), Akt inhibitors, and ADCs, among others. The metastatic breast cancer treatment paradigm is evolving with the introduction of a newly defined subset of HER2-low breast cancer, following the FDA approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan. Our ability to compete effectively in the breast cancer market will depend on evolving standards of care across patient subsets (based on HER2 and hormone receptor status), and our ability to differentiate XMT-2056 and XMT-1660 from other available therapies based on efficacy and tolerability. 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and tolerability of our product candidates.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 228 full time employees, including 151 with M.D., Ph.D. or other advanced degrees. Of these employees, 171 are engaged in research and development and 57 are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees, and focusing on employee well-being and workplace safety. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunity for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and a robust employment package that promotes wellness across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare, retirement planning, and paid time off. 
We also believe that fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion is a key element to discovering, developing and bringing therapies to patients with cancer. As of December 31, 2022, 57% of our global workforce identified as female. We strive to 
build a workforce representative of the communities and patients we serve and to nurture an inclusive culture where all voices are welcomed, heard, and respected.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We occupy approximately 45,000 square feet of office and laboratory space that we lease in the multi-tenant building in which our corporate headquarters are located. The lease for the substantial majority of this space expires in March 2026. We have an option to extend the lease term for an additional five years thereafter. We believe that this office and laboratory space is sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
