Item 1. | BUSINESS

Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, which either on its own or together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as the “Company.” Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Southwest Gas Corporation (“Southwest” or the “natural gas distribution” segment), Centuri Group, Inc. (“Centuri” or the “utility infrastructure services” segment), and prior to the closing of the MountainWest Sale (as defined below) on February 14, 2023, MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company (“MountainWest,” or the “pipeline and storage” segment), the Company operated three business segments: natural gas distribution operations, utility infrastructure services, and pipeline and storage. Following the sale of MountainWest, the Company operates two business segments. Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware and Southwest Gas Corporation is incorporated in California. 
In December 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company’s portfolio of businesses. These actions included entering into a definitive agreement to sell all of the equity interests in MountainWest in an all-cash transaction to Williams Partners Operating LLC (“Williams”) for $1.5 billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments (collectively, the “MountainWest Sale”). Additionally, the Company determined it will pursue a spin-off of Centuri (“Centuri Spin-Off”) to form a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company. The Centuri Spin-Off together with the MountainWest Sale reflect the “Separation Transactions.” As indicated above, the MountainWest Sale closed on February 14, 2023. As such, limited information with respect to MountainWest is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Centuri Spin-Off is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024 and to be tax free to the Company and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Centuri Spin-Off will be subject to, among other things, finalization of the transaction structure, final approval by the Board, approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), the receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling relating to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a registration statement that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Southwest and its subsidiaries provide regulated natural gas delivery services to customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories of Southwest are subject to regulatory oversight. The timing and amount of rate relief can materially impact results of operations. Natural gas purchases and the timing of related recoveries can materially impact liquidity. Results for the natural gas distribution segment are higher during winter periods due to the seasonality incorporated in its regulatory rate structures.
MountainWest, which was part of our operations in 2022, but sold in February 2023, owns and operates over 2,000 miles of highly contracted regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in the Rocky Mountain region, providing service in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, with non-regulated businesses primarily providing analytical and measurement services, and natural gas gathering. MountainWest’s primary operations are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”), including regulated plant, tariff rates, and services performed. MountainWest’s revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. The profitability of MountainWest’s primary pipeline businesses is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices, and the economy. This variability is separate from that which relates to strategic events, such as post-2021 acquisition integration costs or losses/impairment upon being reclassified as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
Centuri is a strategic utility infrastructure services company dedicated to partnering with North America’s electric and gas providers to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes across the United States (“U.S.”) and 
Canada. Centuri’s skilled workforce delivers a comprehensive and integrated array of solutions through its primary operating companies: NPL Construction Co. (“NPL”), NPL Canada Ltd. (“NPL Canada”), New England Utility Constructors, Inc. (“Neuco”), Linetec Services, LLC (“Linetec”), and Riggs Distler & Company, Inc. (“Riggs Distler”). Centuri has strategically expanded its geographic reach and service offerings through organic and inorganic growth to better meet diverse customer needs across both electric and gas infrastructure, including growing customer attention to achieving environmental objectives. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in most of Centuri’s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and in Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity continues year round. The availability of customer-provided materials, input costs, nature of specific customer contracts, and timing of incorporation of costs in change orders, if at all, can materially impact results.

NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION
General Description
Southwest is subject to regulation by the ACC, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (the “PUCN”), and the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”). These commissions regulate public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories in their respective states. The CPUC also regulates the issuance of all debt securities by Southwest, with the exception of short-term borrowings. Certain accounting practices, transmission facilities, and rates are subject to regulation by the FERC. Centuri, by contrast, is not rate regulated by the state utilities commissions or by the FERC in any of its operating areas.
As of December 31, 2022, Southwest purchased and distributed or transported natural gas to 2,197,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in geographically diverse portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest added 41,000 new customers during 2022. 
The table below lists the percentage of operating margin (operating revenues less net cost of gas) by major customer class for the years indicated:

 | Distribution | | 
For the Year Ended December 31, | Residential andSmall Commercial | | Other SalesCustomers | | Transportation
2022 | 85 | % | | 4 | % | 11 | %
2021 | 85 | % | | 4 | % | 11 | %
2020 | 85 | % | | 3 | % | 12 | %

Southwest is not dependent on any one or a few customers such that the loss of any one or several would have a significant adverse impact on earnings or cash flows.
Transportation of customer-secured gas to end-users accounted for 42% of total system throughput in 2022, but represents only 11% of operating margin as shown in the table above. Customers who utilized this service transported 93 million dekatherms in 2022, 95 million dekatherms in 2021, and 98 million dekatherms in 2020.
The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. It is the opinion of management that comparisons of earnings for interim periods do not reliably reflect overall trends and changes in operations due to this seasonality. The decoupled rate mechanisms in place in the three state service territories, as described below, are structured with seasonal variations. Also, earnings for interim, or any, periods can be significantly affected by the timing of general rate relief.
Rates and Regulation
Rates that Southwest is authorized to charge its distribution system customers are determined by the ACC, PUCN, and CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service, and cost of capital experienced in an historical test year, as adjusted in Arizona and Nevada, and projected for a future test year in California. The FERC regulates the northern Nevada transmission and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) storage facilities of Great Basin Gas Transmission Company (“Great Basin”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and the rates it charges for transportation of gas directly to certain end-users and to various local distribution companies (“LDCs”). The LDCs transporting on the Great Basin system are: NV Energy (serving Reno and Sparks, Nevada) and Southwest (serving Truckee, South and North Lake Tahoe in California, and various locations throughout northern Nevada).
Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are set at levels that are intended to allow for the recovery of all commission-approved costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt as well as a reasonable return on common equity. Rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service, net of amounts associated with costs borne by third parties, plus certain other assets such as working capital and inventories, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, net deferred income tax liabilities, and certain other deductions.
Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or “decouple” the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures (alternative revenue programs) vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada and Arizona, the decoupled rate structures apply to most customer classes on the basis of margin per customer, which varies by month. Collectively, these mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin.
Rate schedules in all service areas contain deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment provisions, which allow Southwest to file for rate adjustments as the cost of purchased gas changes. Deferred energy and purchased gas adjustment (collectively “PGA”) rate changes affect cash flows, but have no direct impact on profit margin. Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by the appropriate state regulatory commission staff.
Information with respect to recent general rate cases, PGA filings, and other regulatory proceedings is included in the Rates and Regulatory Proceedings section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), which is incorporated by reference herein and included within the 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Demand for Natural Gas
Deliveries of natural gas by Southwest are made under a priority system established by state regulatory commissions. The priority system is intended to ensure that the gas requirements of higher-priority customers, primarily residential customers and other customers who use 500 therms or less of gas per day, are fully satisfied on a daily basis before lower-priority customers, primarily electric utility and large industrial customers able to use alternative fuels, are provided any quantity of gas or capacity.
Demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature. On cold days, use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be as much as seven times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating. To fully satisfy this increased high-priority demand, gas is withdrawn from storage in certain service areas, or peaking supplies are purchased from suppliers. If necessary, service to interruptible lower-priority customers may be curtailed to provide the needed delivery system capacity. Southwest maintains no significant backlog on its orders for gas service.
Natural Gas Supply
Southwest is responsible for acquiring and arranging delivery of natural gas to its system in sufficient quantities to meet its sales customers’ needs. Southwest’s primary natural gas procurement objective is to ensure that adequate supplies of natural gas are available at a reasonable cost. Southwest acquires natural gas from a wide variety of sources with a mix of purchase provisions, which includes spot market and firm supplies. The purchases may have terms from one day to several years and utilize both fixed and indexed pricing. During 2022, Southwest acquired natural gas from 36 suppliers. Southwest regularly monitors the number of suppliers, their performance, and their relative contribution to the overall customer supply portfolio. New suppliers are contracted when possible, and solicitations for supplies are extended to the largest practicable list of suppliers, taking into account each supplier’s creditworthiness. Competitive pricing, flexibility in meeting Southwest’s requirements, and demonstrated reliability of service are instrumental to any one supplier’s inclusion in Southwest’s portfolio. The goal of this practice is to mitigate the risk of nonperformance by any one supplier and ensure competitive prices in the portfolio.
Balancing reliability with supply cost results in a continually changing mix of purchase provisions within the supply portfolios. To address the unique requirements of its various market areas, Southwest assembles and administers a separate natural gas supply portfolio for each of its jurisdictional areas. Southwest facilitates most natural gas purchases through competitive bid processes.
To mitigate customer exposure to short-term market price volatility, during 2022 Southwest sought to fix the price on a portion of its forecasted annual normal-weather volume requirement (up to 25% in the California jurisdiction and to a limited extent, in the Arizona jurisdiction), primarily using firm, fixed-price purchasing arrangements that are secured periodically throughout the year. Southwest’s price volatility mitigation program previously included the use of financial derivatives, in the form of fixed-for-floating-index-price swaps combined with indexed-price physical purchases, to secure a portion of the fixed-price portfolio, most recently, for the Arizona rate jurisdiction. The combination of fixed-price contracts and financial derivatives was designed to increase flexibility for Southwest and increase supplier diversification. The cost of such financial derivatives combined with the associated indexed-price physical purchases has been recoverable from customers through the PGA mechanism. For periods beyond October 2020, Southwest has not and does not plan at this time to make fixed-price term purchases broadly in other than California (as set forth above), nor engage in swap transactions for any of its territories. 
For the 2022/2023 heating season, firm fixed-price physical commodity purchases ranged from approximately $4.59 to approximately $9.89 per dekatherm. Southwest makes natural gas purchases, not covered by firm fixed-price contracts, under variable-price contracts with firm quantities or on the spot market. Prices for these contracts are determined at the beginning of 
each month to reflect that month’s published first-of-month index price or based on a published daily price index. These monthly or daily index prices are not published or known until the purchase period begins.
The baseload firm natural gas supply arrangements are structured such that Southwest must nominate a stated volume of natural gas and the supplier must confirm that nomination. Contracts provide for fixed or market-based penalties to be paid by the non-performing party.
Storage availability may influence the average annual price of natural gas, as storage may allow a company to purchase natural gas quantities during the off-peak season and store it for use in high demand periods when prices may be greater or supplies/capacity, tighter. Dependent upon the rate jurisdiction, Southwest has some access to storage services, but overall there are small quantities of storage services available for Southwest’s use. For available storage services, Southwest purchases natural gas for injection during the off-peak period for use in the high demand months; however, since storage is limited, its impact is also limited in regard to Southwest’s annual average price of natural gas. Additionally, Southwest utilizes most available storage services for operational purposes to meet customer demand and not for economic purposes. This also limits the influence the available storage services have on Southwest’s average annual price of natural gas.
Southwest currently has no market area storage service availability in its southern Nevada rate jurisdiction; however, in 2022, Southwest began receiving supply area storage services from Spire Storage West that will likely be used for the southern Nevada rate jurisdiction but could also be used to service the northern Nevada or northern California rate jurisdictions, as described below. Southwest generally has limited market area storage services availability for the southern and northern California, northern Nevada, and Arizona rate jurisdictions. The following summarizes Southwest’s access to storage services for those rate jurisdictions.
Southwest has a storage services contract with Southern California Gas Company for use only within Southwest’s southern California rate jurisdiction.
Southwest contracts for storage services from Great Basin’s above-ground LNG facility. This storage service generally provides vaporization and injection, as well as peaking capability only for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. 
Southwest also has interruptible storage contracts with Northwest Pipeline Corporation (“NWPL”) for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. NWPL has the discretion to limit Southwest’s ability to inject or withdraw from this interruptible storage, which consequently limits Southwest’s use of this interruptible storage capacity. As such, this storage provides limited operational flexibility to adjust daily flowing supplies to meet demand.
For the Arizona rate jurisdiction, Southwest operates a 233,000 dekatherm above-ground LNG facility in southern Arizona. This facility is intended to enhance service reliability and flexibility in natural gas deliveries in the area by providing a local storage option that is operated by Southwest and connected directly to its distribution system. 
Natural gas supplies for Southwest’s southern system (Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California properties) are primarily obtained from producing regions in Colorado and New Mexico (San Juan basin), Texas (Permian basin), and Rocky Mountain areas. For its northern system (northern Nevada and northern California properties), Southwest primarily obtains natural gas from Rocky Mountain producing areas and from Canada.
The landscape for national natural gas supply is continuously changing, including impacts related to governmental policies. Advanced drilling techniques continue to provide access to abundant and sustainable natural gas supplies. The natural gas market has responded to the abundant supply of natural gas at prices that are competitive with other forms of energy; however, the market price of natural gas has spiked in recent periods as a result of numerous market forces, including historically low storage levels, upstream maintenance events, and cold weather conditions across the central United States in December 2022 and regional pricing dislocation on the west coast in January 2023. In early 2021, winter storms in the central U.S. also led to unprecedented price spikes over a number of days. As a result of this increase in pricing, Southwest has undertaken incremental borrowing in order to fund the higher cost, including recently, when it entered into a $450 million term loan in January 2023 in order to fund increased supply costs. Southwest may be required to incur additional indebtedness in connection with future spikes in natural gas prices as a result of extreme weather events, or otherwise. Forecasts show that an ample and diverse natural gas supply continues to be available to Southwest’s customers at a competitive price when compared to competing energy forms.
Southwest arranges for transportation of natural gas to its Arizona, Nevada, and California service territories through the pipeline systems of El Paso Natural Gas Company (“El Paso”), Kern River Gas Transmission Company (“Kern River”), Transwestern Pipeline Company (“Transwestern”), NWPL, Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company (“Tuscarora”), Southern California Gas Company, Great Basin, and Ruby Pipeline LLC (“Ruby”), costs for which are recovered from Southwest’s customers through the PGA mechanism. Southwest regularly monitors short- and long-term supply and pipeline capacity availability to ensure the reliability of service to its customers. Southwest currently receives firm transportation service, both on a short- and long-term basis, for all its service territories on the pipeline systems noted above. Southwest also contracts for firm natural gas supplies that are delivered to Southwest’s city gates to supplement its firm capacity on the interstate pipelines and to 
meet projected peak-day demands. Southwest could also utilize its interruptible contracts on the interstate pipelines for the transportation of additional natural gas supplies.
Southwest believes that the current levels of contracted firm interstate capacity and delivered purchases are sufficient to serve each of its service territories’ forecasted peak-day requirements. As the need arises to acquire additional capacity on one of the interstate pipeline transmission systems and to secure additional supply, primarily due to customer growth, Southwest will continue to consider available options to obtain that capacity (either through the use of firm contracts with a pipeline company or by purchasing capacity on the open market), and will also consider options for the purchase of additional firm delivered natural gas supplies.
Competition
Electric utilities are the principal competitors of Southwest for the residential and small commercial markets throughout its service areas. Competition for space heating, general household, and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer/builder typically makes the decision as to which type of equipment to install and operate. The customer will generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Southwest interfaces directly with the various home builders and commercial property developers in its service territories to ensure that natural gas appliances are considered in new developments and commercial centers. As a result of its efforts, Southwest has continued to experience growth in the new construction market among residential and small commercial customer classes. In 2022, Southwest provided natural gas to a large majority of the new homes constructed during the year in the major metropolitan markets composing our service territories.
Certain large commercial, industrial, and electric generation customers have the capability to switch to alternative energy sources. To date, Southwest has been successful in retaining most of these customers by setting rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs) at levels competitive with commercially available alternative energy sources such as electricity and fuel oils. However, high natural gas prices or policies surrounding electrification could impact Southwest’s ability to retain some of these customers. Reducing fossil fuel use has gained momentum in governmental policy overall in recent years. Southwest has taken steps to align with these efforts by supporting energy efficiency in our jurisdictions, being part of greenhouse gas protocols and initiatives in California, partnering on hydrogen blending innovation, and creating new biogas and renewable natural gas (“RNG”) tariff schedules in Arizona, California, and Nevada. See also “Environmental Matters” below. While certain forms of renewable energy initiatives compete with natural gas, the abundance, low cost, resiliency, and reliability of natural gas, as well as the convenience and comfort it provides to our customers, result in competitive advantages across our portfolio of customers. Overall, management does not anticipate any material adverse impact on operating margin from fuel switching or alternative energy initiatives over the near term.
Southwest competes with interstate transmission pipeline companies, such as El Paso, Kern River, Transwestern, Tuscarora, and Ruby to provide service to certain large end-users. End-use customers located in proximity to these interstate pipelines pose a potential bypass threat. Southwest closely monitors each customer situation and provides competitive service in order to retain the customer. Southwest has remained competitive through the use of negotiated transportation contract rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs), special long-term contracts with electric generation and cogeneration customers, and other tariff programs. These competitive response initiatives have mitigated the loss of operating margin earned from large customers.
Environmental Matters
Federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment have a direct impact upon Southwest. Environmental efforts, with respect to matters such as storm water management, emissions of air pollutants, hazardous material management, and protection of endangered species and archaeological resources, directly impact the complexity and time required to obtain pipeline rights-of-way and construction permits. There have also been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions (“GHGs”), such as methane. The adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by state governments mandating a substantial reduction in GHGs, or decarbonization generally, could have significant impacts on the energy industry in the future. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for natural gas, or impact the prices we charge our customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations, if adopted, on our future business, financial condition, or results. However, increased environmental legislation and regulation can also be beneficial to the natural gas industry. Natural gas is more environmentally friendly than many other fuels currently available and its use can help energy users comply with stricter environmental air quality standards. While transportation is typically cited as the leading source of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S., natural gas for residential consumption/use is cited as accounting for less than 6% of total U.S. GHG emissions. 
Southwest remains committed to providing customers with safe, reliable, sustainable, and affordable natural gas service and continues to work with policy makers and regulators to support and adopt renewable initiatives and expanded use of RNG and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) as a transportation fuel. Additionally, Southwest is investigating blending hydrogen into its gas supply. Southwest is not only supporting a regional transportation customer in Nevada with its fleet’s RNG and CNG needs, but Southwest also received favorable cost recovery regarding the conversion of part of its own vehicle fleet to CNG, in support of the state’s GHG emission reduction goals. In recent years, regulatory activity in Arizona, California, and Nevada led to provisions allowing for the development of RNG projects. In addition, proposals were previously made in all three states to allow Southwest to purchase RNG as part of its gas supply portfolio; in the California and Nevada jurisdictions, those proposals have been accepted by regulators or legislative bodies.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and State of California Environmental Protection Agency (the “Cal/EPA”) regulations require the reporting of GHGs from large sources and suppliers in order to facilitate the development of policies and programs to reduce GHGs. Southwest reports required information to the EPA and Cal/EPA under respective rules, including the volumes of natural gas that it receives for distribution to LDC customers, and the GHG emissions that result from the operation of its LDC pipelines.
California legislation and regulations promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) require Southwest to comply with the California GHG Emissions Reporting Program and the California Cap and Trade Program, which play an important role in the state’s goal of reducing GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Southwest must report annual GHGs each year. The CARB annually allocates to Southwest a certain number of allowances based on Southwest’s reported 2011 GHGs. Of those allocated allowances, Southwest must consign a certain percentage to the CARB for auction. Southwest can use any allocated allowances that remain after consignment, along with allowances it can purchase through CARB auctions or reserve sales, or through over the counter (“OTC”) purchases with other market participants, to meet its compliance obligations.
As part of this program, there are ongoing three-year compliance periods established. The current compliance period ends in 2023. Southwest successfully met its earlier compliance obligations by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to the required date, the most recent of which was November 1, 2021. Southwest will meet the 2023 compliance obligation by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to November 1, 2024, or may surrender carbon offsets to meet a portion of the 2023 compliance obligation. In 2022, Southwest purchased carbon offsets that will partially meet the 2023 compliance obligation. Carbon offsets can only be used to satisfy a portion of the 2023 compliance obligation, and those combined with ongoing allowance purchases will support compliance years through 2023. The CPUC previously issued a decision that provides for the regulatory treatment of the program costs. The decision also implemented the California Climate Credit in October 2018, representing a return of auction proceeds, which is updated annually each April. There is no expected direct impact on earnings. 
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
Centuri is a strategic utility infrastructure services company dedicated to partnering with North America’s gas and electric providers to build and maintain the energy network that powers millions of homes across the U.S. and Canada. Centuri’s skilled workforce delivers a comprehensive and integrated array of solutions through its operating companies. Centuri derives revenue primarily from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy networks. The primary focus of Centuri operations is the replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and electric service lines, as well as new infrastructure installations. Centuri has formalized a service offering for emergency utility system restoration services to bring customers’ above-ground utility infrastructure back online following regional storms and other extreme weather events. Utility infrastructure services work varies from relatively small projects to the installation of infrastructure for entire residential communities or business parks. Centuri seeks to build long-term relationships with customers to meet their needs across geographies and across both gas and electric infrastructure. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in many of Centuri’s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity typically continues year round. 
During recent years, various factors resulted in an increase in large multi-year utility system replacement programs and expanded protocols. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 established mandatory electric grid reliability standards and incentivized investments in transmission and distribution systems. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) instituted Distribution Integrity Management Programs (“DIMP”) effective February 2010, which required operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs to enhance safety by identifying and reducing pipeline integrity risks. FERC Order No. 1000, issued in July 2011, established transmission planning requirements to encourage development of electric transmission infrastructure projects. In 2020, PHMSA issued its final “Mega Rule,” including requirements for reconfirming transmission pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure and verification of pipeline materials, in addition to expanding assessments and requirements for work in moderate consequence areas, among other things. Then, in March 2022, and August 2022, PHMSA issued rules 
amending federal pipeline safety regulations applicable to valve installation and minimum rupture detection standards for transmission pipelines, and amendments applicable to transmission pipeline integrity management, effective in October 2022 and May 2023, respectively. Likewise, there has been significant attention placed on electric grid modernization through national infrastructure legislation and related initiatives. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act includes a number of provisions to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including incentives for the buildout of necessary infrastructure. The Department of Energy estimates more than 70% of the nation’s grid transmission lines and power transformers are over 25 years old, creating vulnerability exacerbated by seasonal storm and extreme weather events. Centuri’s services also support customers’ environmental goals, such as reducing methane emissions from pipeline leaks through pipe repair and replacement. Centuri is well positioned to support growing customer attention in achieving environmental objectives through infrastructure construction and maintenance. Additionally, Centuri’s acquisition of Riggs Distler in 2021 positions Centuri to benefit from the necessary development of onshore infrastructure to support offshore wind and power development.
Centuri’s contract terms with utility customers generally specify unit-price or time-and-materials (“T&M”) terms under master service agreements, and occasionally, fixed-price arrangements for bid work. Unit-price contracts establish prices for all of the various services to be performed during the contract period. These contracts often have annual pricing reviews that provide an opportunity for Centuri to reflect anticipated increases in labor costs. Centuri customers supply materials required for building and maintenance services under the majority of Centuri’s contracts, and thus, increased costs of materials generally do not present a direct material risk to Centuri. During 2022, approximately 82% of revenue was earned under unit-price and T&M contracts. Storm restoration services are often contracted under T&M rates and generally involve a higher number of hours worked per day given the emergency response nature of the work performed. Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue Centuri expects to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress as of the end of the reporting period. Reported backlog differs from the concept of remaining performance obligations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and is not a measure of contract profitability. As of December 31, 2022, backlog of approximately $441 million existed with respect to outstanding fixed-priced contracts. Centuri maintains an average customer relationship tenure of more than 20 years, supported by its unwavering commitments to safety, quality, community engagement, and workforce development.
Materials used by Centuri in its utility infrastructure service activities are typically specified, purchased, and supplied by Centuri’s customers. Contracts with customers also contain provisions which make customers generally liable for remediating environmental hazards encountered during the construction process. Such hazards might include digging in an area that was contaminated prior to construction, finding endangered animals, digging in historically significant sites, etc. Otherwise, Centuri’s operations have limited environmental impact (dust control, normal waste disposal, handling harmful materials, etc.).
Competition within the industry has traditionally been limited to several regional and numerous local competitors in what has been a largely fragmented industry. Some national competitors also exist within the industry. Centuri operates in over 73 primary locations across 45 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada, with its corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona. During 2022, Centuri served over 400 customers. Southwest accounted for approximately 5% of total revenue. Two additional customers accounted for approximately 18% of total revenue. No other customers individually accounted for 5% or more of total revenue.
Centuri is not directly affected by regulations promulgated by the ACC, PUCN, CPUC, or FERC. Centuri is an unregulated subsidiary of the Company. However, because Centuri performs work for Southwest, its associated costs are subject indirectly to “prudency reviews” like any other capital work performed by third parties or directly by Southwest. However, these reviews do not bring Centuri under the regulatory jurisdiction of any of the commissions noted above.
PIPELINE AND STORAGE 
As described above, on February 14, 2023, the Company completed the sale of all of the equity interests in MountainWest. MountainWest’s operations are comprised of over 2,000 miles of highly-contracted FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines providing transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. MountainWest includes two wholly owned, FERC-regulated businesses (referred to herein as MountainWest Pipeline and MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline), and another FERC-regulated pipeline held as a 50% interest in White River Hub (“WRH”). WRH is a variable interest entity of which MountainWest is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, WRH is not consolidated with MountainWest and is, instead, accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Collectively, MountainWest has fewer than one hundred customers, which include storage customers, marketers, end-users, power generators, or utilities. The two largest customers comprise nearly half of their expected revenues. 
MountainWest’s operations are primarily in the midstream, including 56 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of storage capacity that has, in the recent past, been at or near full contracting.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Throughout our collective operations, employees are critical to our success. Their talent and dedication are what allows us to provide safe and reliable service to customers and explore new opportunities that align with our strategies, while carrying out organizational core values related to safety, quality, and stewardship, among others. The Board oversees matters relating to our vision, values, and culture where employee health and safety; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and human and workplace rights are priorities. The Board receives regular reports from management and subject matter experts in these areas, and in turn provides guidance on current and future initiatives. The Board also assists management in integrating responsibility and sustainability into strategic activities to create long-term customer and shareholder value.
Our Company and the Board are committed to a culture of continuous improvement over the safety of our employees and the communities we serve every day. Employees and contract workers receive initial safety orientation training to learn practices, procedures, and policies established by our businesses. New and recurring safety training occurs at regular intervals thereafter. Frontline safety strategies, developed with executive leadership, contribute to the improvement of our safety management systems. Safety metrics also form part of incentive compensation programs for leaders of all the Company’s business segments, reinforcing our top priority to safeguard our communities, our employees, and our assets. At Southwest, such metrics include Damages per 1,000 Tickets and Incident Response Time; at Centuri, they include Total Recordable Incident Rate and Days Away/Restricted/Transferred (“DART”). In each case, the measures are widely used in the respective industries comprising our businesses. All segments maintain additional behavioral-based programs and extensive employee training initiatives to promote safe work.
At December 31, 2022, Southwest had 2,351 regular full-time equivalent employees. Southwest believes that a skilled, highly trained workforce is a key to success in the utility industry, and a driver of Southwest’s safety performance and high customer satisfaction ratings. Southwest believes it has a good relationship with its employees and that compensation, benefits, and working conditions are comparable to those generally found in the utility industry. In recent years, employee engagement surveys have been deployed to gauge the extent to which employees feel connected and valued. Flexible working arrangements are available to employees, which support work-life balance. No Southwest employees are represented by a labor union. A stable workforce has been important to knowledge transfer and succession processes, with the average tenure of Southwest employees being approximately 11 years. Germane to attracting and retaining employees are our compensation and benefits programs, which are regularly reviewed. For employees hired on or before December 31, 2021, Southwest offers an employee pension and employer matching contributions to the employee defined contribution plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2022 do not participate in the employee pension plan, but receive non-elective employer contributions and increased employer matching contributions to the employee defined contribution plan. The health and wellness of our workforce are supported by group insurance programs, incentive programs in support of total health, and related employee programs. Southwest also offers a tuition assistance program. Regular succession planning helps ensure that talent is identified, and existing and prospective leaders are developed in order to build their skills and be prepared for future roles.
At December 31, 2022, Centuri had 11,008 regular full-time equivalent employees working in over 45 states and provinces throughout the U.S. and Canada. Employee counts fluctuate between seasonal periods, normally heaviest in the summer and fall. Typical of the segment’s industry, a majority of Centuri employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Centuri maintains a market-based total rewards strategy to attract, retain, motivate, and develop employees. Additionally, Centuri has a scholarship program, which awards more than half of the grants to minority students who are dependents of Centuri employees. Similar employee engagement and succession planning protocols to those existing at Southwest are deployed at Centuri.
As of December 31, 2022, MountainWest had 255 full-time employees across Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. MountainWest is comprised of a highly skilled workforce which provides gas transportation and underground storage services in the midstream space. MountainWest does not have a unionized workforce. The MountainWest workforce transferred with the business as part of the sale to Williams in February 2023. Upon close, the Company is to provide certain services to Williams under a transition services agreement for a brief period, generally not beyond six months.
Collectively, we embrace a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion to not only protect employees under laws designed to do so regardless of protected status, but to reinforce the value that diversity brings to the workplace. We strive to have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve, and engage experts from time to time to update management on the trends and benefits of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. Our belief is that adherence to these principles forms the genesis of a workforce that is both diverse and inclusive. Southwest and Centuri have several programs, including employee resource groups, diversity councils, a diversity ambassadors (champions) network, educational outreach programs, and other initiatives designed to attract and retain a diverse workforce. We commit to creating a safe and respectful workplace by encouraging employees to value diversity through unconscious bias training, and by inviting them to engage in meaningful conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. Through these and other efforts, we place value in our people and nurture their development, while ensuring that all employees have an equitable opportunity for success.
