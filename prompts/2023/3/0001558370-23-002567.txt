​
Industry Background
​
Conventional manufacturing processes have numerous shortcomings.
Historically, processes such as casting, stamping, molding and machining have dominated global manufacturing, which is a $14.2 trillion industry in 2021, according to the Wohlers Report 2022. These conventional and subtractive manufacturing techniques have 

4



numerous limitations. Most require high upfront expenses in the form of tools, such as molds, dies, jigs or fixtures. Designing and manufacturing these tools can result in long lead times for parts as well as minimum volume requirements in order to achieve cost efficiencies. 
Tooling requirements associated with casting, stamping, and injection molding also leave little room for design iteration without increasing time-to-market and development costs. New parts and design changes often require a new tool, thereby slowing the pace at which businesses can introduce new products and react to shifts in market preferences and making it difficult to compete effectively. Computer numerical controlled machining, or CNC machining, is an alternative to stamping, casting and molding that does not require a mold or die, enabling lower-volume production with reduced lead times. However, because CNC machining is a subtractive process in which material is removed from a solid block to create a part, it typically results in higher part costs and significant material waste. In addition, the CNC machining process often requires heavy involvement from specialist technicians, and machine programming can be time intensive. Each of these conventional manufacturing processes also creates design restrictions that can result in significantly higher part weights and costs or require assemblies, adversely impacting performance in favor of manufacturability and driving additional manufacturing and supply chain complexity.
Additive manufacturing has the potential to address the limitations of conventional manufacturing.
Additive manufacturing addresses many of the limitations of conventional manufacturing through a combination of flexibility, ease of use and cost, making it an efficient and effective process across the product life cycle, from design and prototyping to production. Additive manufacturing is a digital manufacturing process that produces 3D objects from digital models through the repeated deposition of thin layers of material. This process eliminates the need for tooling inputs and provides a range of benefits including:

• | Accelerated time-to-market. Businesses can manufacture design files at the push of a button with no tooling required. While design cycles for conventional manufacturing can take weeks or months, additive manufacturing can shorten this cycle to days due to the ability to rapidly switch between or iterate on designs without excessive delay. Such improvements in time-to-market for new products can help businesses react more rapidly to shifts in customer demand. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design flexibility. Conventional manufacturing can force design compromises as a result of subtractive manufacturing processes or the use of tools. While 3D printing may involve design guidelines primarily to reduce dependency on supports and optimize process success, designers generally have freedom to produce geometries not possible or economically feasible with conventional manufacturing. As an example, with additive manufacturing, designers can produce intricate organic or complex, lattice shapes that are optimized for strength and functional performance to reduce weight and material usage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assembly consolidation. Improved design flexibility enables the consolidation of sub-assemblies into single parts, which can improve reliability by reducing the number of failure points in a product. Decreasing part quantity is also a productivity breakthrough for many businesses. With fewer unique parts to fabricate, procure, store and assemble, businesses can drastically simplify their supply chains. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mass customization. Additive manufacturing enables the customization and production of designs at scale, eliminating costs traditionally associated with multiple tools and tooling changeover as well as reducing the risk of excess inventory and material obsolescence. Each part printed using additive manufacturing can be identical to or radically different from the other parts within a given print. Several end markets, including audiology and dental, have already leveraged mass customization through additive manufacturing to improve the aesthetics and performance of parts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply chain re-engineering. Additive manufacturing suitable for end-use parts and spare parts production can improve supply chains by enabling on-demand manufacturing in distributed locations. Decentralized networks of additive manufacturing systems with low tooling and set-up costs can replace centralized facilities with conventional manufacturing equipment in locations frequently selected because of lower cost of labor. In addition, producing parts near the point and time of demand can significantly reduce lead times, inventories, and dependencies on forecasting without incurring additional costs related to logistics and customs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustainable manufacturing. Additive manufacturing is a more efficient production process than subtractive techniques, such as CNC machining. It requires fewer material inputs and reduces material waste. By enabling optimized geometries

lighter than conventionally manufactured counterparts, additive manufacturing can also lead to downstream sustainability benefits, including reduced fuel consumption in industries such as automotive and aerospace. In addition, by reducing supply chain complexity, additive manufacturing can reduce emissions from transporting physical goods around the world.
Many businesses are motivated to deploy additive manufacturing to improve production processes at-scale.
Many businesses faced with increased global competition and rapidly changing market preferences are turning to additive manufacturing to overcome the limitations of conventional manufacturing and provide a competitive advantage. While many businesses still value the rapid prototyping benefits of additive manufacturing, they are also eager to realize benefits largely related to end-use part production. According to Ernst & Young, over 50% of industrial businesses expect to use additive manufacturing to produce products that better meet customer requirements; reduce logistics efforts, transport and inventories; and manufacture existing products at lower costs.
Most existing additive manufacturing technologies primarily focus on design & prototyping applications.
Additive manufacturing technologies face stringent business requirements for use in production with respect to accuracy, surface finish, material properties and throughput, all of which must meet or exceed the standards set by more mature conventional manufacturing alternatives. Most commercially available 3D printers leverage legacy additive manufacturing technologies including fused filament fabrication, or FFF, stereolithography, or SLA, and powder bed fusion, or PBF. These first-generation 3D printing technologies build parts by tracing each layer using a single point or multiple points, such as an extrusion nozzle in FFF printers or a laser in SLA and PBF systems. While these technologies have evolved significantly since the early 2000s, and have mostly overcome initial deficiencies around accuracy, surface finish and material properties, their throughput and the resulting production economics have continued to present a challenge. Such technologies can typically only increase part throughput with additional time or systems, which limits customers’ ability to increase production without also increasing their equipment costs. Many existing additive manufacturing solutions consequently continue to focus on design and prototyping use cases or other low volume production applications where design flexibility and turnaround time are important to customers, but costs and part throughput are not, and where other key performance measures, including accuracy, surface finish and material properties are also less critical.
As a result, businesses still face hurdles in adopting legacy additive manufacturing for end-use production.
While the growth of additive manufacturing has accelerated in recent years, many companies still hesitate to fully adopt the existing, legacy technologies to produce end-use parts in volume, preventing them from realizing the full benefits of additive manufacturing. Ernst & Young found that only 18% of industrial businesses in 2019 used additive manufacturing for end-use parts, lagging other use cases such as rapid prototyping. Because these existing, legacy technologies are better suited to design and prototyping applications, businesses pursuing additive manufacturing solutions face significant barriers to adopting these technologies for end-use applications. Using legacy additive manufacturing technologies to make end-use parts can be expensive, particularly for businesses under margin pressure. This is due to the high costs of legacy additive manufacturing equipment and related consumable materials, which are often priced at high levels by vendors to compensate for the low productivity of their systems. When combined with the limited throughput of these legacy additive manufacturing technologies, high upfront and operating costs result in part costs that typically cannot compete with conventional manufacturing. Consequently, industries that require inexpensive parts in large quantities, such as automotive and consumer products, face challenges in adopting additive manufacturing for end-use parts production.
​

According to 

6



market research and management estimates, this market is expected grow from $15.2 billion in 2021 to approximately $100.0 billion by 2031 at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%, as additive manufacturing displaces conventional manufacturing across a growing range of applications.
​
Our Growth Strategy
​
The key elements of our strategy for growth include the following:
Focus on solutions that make additive manufacturing accessible for volume production and end-use applications.
We believe the adoption of additive manufacturing, particularly for end-use parts, is driven by the availability of solutions that offer a tool-free, digital path to producing large quantities of parts that are both higher performance and lower cost than achievable through conventional manufacturing processes. Our product portfolio is focused on additive manufacturing printer platforms designed for Additive Manufacturing 2.0, or the volume production of end-use parts, and we intend to continue investing resources in enhancing these solutions and developing technologies with breakthrough advances in print speed and other process parameters to deliver the highest throughput systems and lowest part costs in the additive manufacturing market. We believe such improvements will encourage customer investment in additive manufacturing across a range of industrial applications and vertical markets where conventional manufacturing has customarily held cost and volume advantages and where alternative additive manufacturing suppliers cannot compete. Focusing on production applications also enables us to capture recurring revenue streams associated with parts in production through the sales of consumables and service contracts. We are committed to lowering the barriers to deploying such additive manufacturing solutions in manufacturing lines by integrating and providing the hardware, materials and software required to deploy end-use parts. To accomplish this, we intend to continue investing in materials and sintering technologies complementary to our 3D printers that enable ease of use and broad adoption across a wide set of customers with varying levels of experience with additive manufacturing.
Qualify additional materials to reach new verticals and expand our addressable market
Our current product portfolio supports 3D printing using an extensive library of materials, including metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, sands, composites, wood and biocompatible materials, and we are in the process of qualifying additional materials for printing that meet or exceed the properties achievable through conventional manufacturing processes. Our metal additive manufacturing systems are designed using sintering-based, powder metallurgy processes, for which hundreds of well-characterized metal alloys and ceramics are available, offering a broad set of materials for us to evaluate and qualify for use with these platforms. Several of these solutions also provide open platforms for customers to develop and print with proprietary or third-party materials while others offer a full, turnkey experience including metal powders which we qualify and distribute for customer use. Our photopolymer systems support a wide range of both proprietary and third-party, industry-validated resins through a selectively open business model. By developing or qualifying additional materials on our systems and enabling customers and partners to do the same, we believe we can serve a broader customer base and address new applications and vertical markets, thereby expanding market share of our solutions and helping drive adoption of additive manufacturing.
Extend our distribution channels and reach
We have a leading global distribution network for our additive manufacturing technology solutions consisting of over 140 resellers, covering more than 40 countries around the world. Our direct sales force augments the reach of our distribution network, focusing primarily on selling our higher priced solutions, cross-selling our solutions across materials, serving major accounts and expanding our footprint within multinational and Fortune 500 organizations. We intend to extend this hybrid distribution approach by adding further geographic coverage and sales capacity across both reseller and direct sales channels as well as developing industry-specific expertise to drive penetration in vertical markets such as automotive, foundries, aerospace, healthcare and dental, and consumer products. 
Build a diverse, global customer base across industries and applications
We believe that our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop a diverse, global customer base to reduce risks associated with revenue concentration in any single geographic region or industry. Our customers today include businesses of all sizes, ranging from small and medium enterprises to Fortune 500 organizations and span many industries and applications, including automotive, 

7



foundries, healthcare and dental, consumer products, heavy industry, aerospace, machine design and research and development. We believe this diversification will also allow us to identify new applications for which our solutions are appropriate and provide us with customer feedback to assist our product development efforts and ensure we are addressing a broad range of market needs. 
Promote awareness through training and education
As businesses increasingly embrace additive manufacturing over the next decade, we intend to educate the market on best practices for adoption of the technology across the entire product life cycle. Our leadership position provides a platform to deliver this education both for our existing customers and the market as a whole, generating organic interest in our solutions and facilitating our business expansion. Such education is a critical component of our sales and marketing efforts. We believe businesses that are well-informed or that have firsthand experience of the benefits of our additive manufacturing solutions relative to conventional manufacturing are more likely to purchase and expand their use of our products and services over time. To drive such awareness, we are developing rich additive manufacturing content and curricula for delivery through both online and in-person media, including classes, programs, certifications, and professional services. We are developing global centers of excellence, leveraging our own headquarters in conjunction with our distribution network’s presences, to serve as showrooms for our solutions, learning facilities and focal points for additive manufacturing-focused professional services.
Develop robust produced parts offerings focused on “killer apps” for additive manufacturing
We are establishing produced parts offerings in which we directly manufacture parts for sale to our customers with a focus on key, high-value applications and verticals in which additive manufacturing can provide significant design, performance, cost and supply chain advantages relative to conventional manufacturing. These offerings will enable us to provide a more holistic suite of solutions for our customers and enable the accelerated adoption of our Additive Manufacturing 2.0 solutions across select high-value and high margin production applications, which we refer to as “killer apps”, including, but not limited to, medical and dental devices, and fluid power systems. For example, we are building Desktop Labs, a dental and biofabrication platform focused on leveraging our proprietary additive manufacturing solutions to vertically integrate into digital solutions, design services and parts production capabilities for dental and biofabrication applications. By leveraging additive manufacturing, we believe we can provide improved delivery timelines, higher performance parts, and a more integrated, end-to-end customer experience relative to manufacturers that leverage conventional processes, enabling pricing power and accelerating our customer acquisition capabilities. Providing produced parts also enables customers to leverage our technology for these “killer apps” with a lower initial capital expenditure investment before bringing their production in-house when they are ready to purchase our additive manufacturing systems. We believe such services will facilitate lead generation for our additive manufacturing systems at scale and enable high-performance and specialized applications using new materials ahead of broader market introduction. 
Our Competitive Strengths
​
We are a pioneer in the additive manufacturing industry with a mission to make the technology accessible to all designers, engineers, and manufacturers. We believe our collective expertise coupled with the following competitive strengths, will allow us to maintain and extend a leadership position in next-generation additive manufacturing and expand our market opportunity:
Differentiated and proprietary technology platform focused on area-wide print processes reinforced by a strong intellectual property portfolio
We have invested significant resources in developing proprietary technologies to accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing for the volume production of end-use parts. Elements of these technologies and processes are protected by our know-how and by over 950 patents or pending patent applications, which reinforces our competitive advantage. A majority of our proprietary technologies improve upon binder jetting or digital light processing, or DLP, which are “area-wide” 3D printing processes that use inkjet printheads or DLP projectors, respectively, to print an entire layer or large sections of a layer at one time. Such area-wide processes are consequently more efficient and can address higher volume applications than processes used by other additive manufacturing suppliers, such as FFF, SLA and PBF, which trace each layer over time using single (or multiple) points of energy or material deposition. For example, our Single Pass Jetting, or SPJ, technology combines all the sequential steps of conventional binder jetting and applies them with each pass of a single carriage over the “build box” to achieve dramatic reductions in print time per layer, leading to significant increases in part capacity and improvements in part costs. Similarly, in DLP, our proprietary Hyperprint technology leverages closed-loop processing in combination with a heated resin vat for improved accuracy and higher speed while our 

8



Projection Array technology combines multiple high-resolution projectors into a single exposure, increasing power density and resolution to improve print speeds and enable large format build areas for production applications.
High printer throughput
We believe that the proprietary technologies used on each of our binder jet and DLP platforms enables the highest rate of parts production per unit of time among competing additive manufacturing systems for a given layer resolution. The Production System P-50, which is designed to achieve print speeds of up to 12,000 cubic centimeters per hour at a 65-micron printed layer height, can enable customers to manufacture up to hundreds of thousands or even millions of parts per year using additive manufacturing, unlocking new applications due to improved part costs and enhanced design flexibility. The Xtreme 8K uses patented Projection Array technology to support printing large photopolymer parts at build speeds up to 100 times those of legacy thermoplastic FFF printers. Our additive manufacturing solutions employ additional, proprietary technology innovations as a means to overcome some of the challenges that arise with high-speed 3D printing and ensure part consistency, accuracy, and resolution. Through continued advances in underlying hardware and our own technology and processes, we believe that our products’ print speeds will continue to increase, driving down the cost of parts produced on our additive manufacturing systems. This will further differentiate our solutions from competitors while also improving our ability to compete with conventional manufacturing processes at larger quantities of parts and across a wider range of applications.
Integrated, turnkey solutions
We aim to provide our customers with easy-to-use, turnkey solutions for additive manufacturing without the need for additional third-party equipment or software. We believe a compelling user experience across our product portfolio begins with cohesive and modern software applications for efficient build preparation and communication with our additive manufacturing systems, which receive feature enhancements via over-the-air or offline firmware updates. For our solutions related to metal additive manufacturing, which is a complex process that involves multiple steps to go from a digital file to a metal part, we have developed breakthrough sintering simulation and compensation software as well as a furnace using proprietary technology purpose-built to provide industrial strength, partial-pressure and vacuum-enabled sintering in an office-friendly package. Sintering is a critical step for powder metallurgy-based metal additive manufacturing processes. These additional software and hardware solutions enable customers with minimal additive manufacturing experience or materials expertise to process high-density, complex metal parts entirely in-house with high accuracy while reducing trial-and-error without third-party equipment required. Similarly, we provide cleaning and curing solutions for our photopolymer additive manufacturing systems, enabling customers to fully process parts post-print to achieve exceptional material properties, resolution and accuracy. We also provide a range of proprietary and third-party consumables and materials optimized for use with our additive manufacturing systems and designed to enable high-quality parts with consistency.
Broad product portfolio and material library
Every organization has a different challenge or application that drives its consideration of additive manufacturing. We offer our customers a range of solutions spanning multiple price points, throughput levels, operating environments, and technologies to enable businesses to find the solution that solves their specific pain point and achieves their goals across an extensive library of qualified materials. Our broad product portfolio covers a spectrum of use cases, scaling with customer needs from entry-level, office-friendly additive manufacturing systems for low volume production of metal, polymer, composite or biocompatible parts to high-end, industrial additive manufacturing systems for mass production of low-cost metal, polymer, elastomer, ceramic, sand or wood parts. In addition, this portfolio eliminates the need for customers to source products for different applications from multiple third-party vendors, giving us a market advantage relative to competitors with a more limited set of solutions.
Global presence and distribution capabilities
We have developed an industry-leading global distribution network for our additive manufacturing solutions consisting of over 140 resellers covering over 40 countries around the world and within a short drive of a significant portion of worldwide manufacturing sector locations. Our resellers, who have extensive experience across digital modeling, 3D printing, and metal and polymer manufacturing processes, provide marketing, sales, application engineering, and local support services for end users across an array of vertical markets, such as healthcare and dental. They also bring an existing base of customers worldwide into which we can drive awareness of and ultimately sell our additive manufacturing solutions. Our direct sales force augments the reach of our global distribution network, serving major accounts and expanding our footprint within multinational and Fortune 500 organizations. To 

9



support both our reseller and direct sales channels, we leverage an experienced team of application engineers who help customers identify and develop compelling use cases for additive manufacturing in their organizations to drive adoption of our solutions. We believe this hybrid distribution approach allows us to efficiently expand our customer deployments from a single machine to multiple machines and scale across a range of price points and solution complexities while enabling a tight and ongoing relationship with customers of all sizes.
We have also established adoption centers in each of the Americas, the Europe, the Middle East and Asia, or EMEA region, and the Asia-Pacific, or APAC region, through which we offer sales and marketing and delivery of support and printing services to our customers. These adoption centers provide us with physical presence alongside our reseller locations in or near areas where many global industrial businesses have manufacturing facilities, providing potential customers with the ability to see our additive manufacturing systems in operation and evaluate their production capabilities prior to ordering such solutions to bring production in-house.

​
Our Additive Manufacturing Solutions
 ​
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated additive manufacturing solutions comprised of hardware, software, materials and services with support for metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, sands, composites, wood, and biocompatible materials. Our additive manufacturing solutions, which are based on our proprietary technologies, are described below.
Metal Additive Manufacturing Systems
Our metal additive manufacturing systems are designed using sintering-based, powder metallurgy processes, in which metal powder is bound together in a printer and sintered in a furnace to form a dense metal part. Hundreds of metal alloys are available to such powder metallurgy processes, many with well-characterized and high-quality material properties.
Our binder jet metal additive manufacturing platforms are differentiated in their ability to deliver high-performance printed metal parts at production-scale volumes and part costs competitive with conventional manufacturing processes. These platforms, including the Production System, the Shop System, and the X-Series, collectively offer a range of price points, throughput levels, and build sizes, ensuring our customers can find a solution that fits their specific application needs and enabling them to scale their manufacturing operations within the Desktop Metal solutions ecosystem.
The Production System is an industrial manufacturing platform powered by patent-pending SPJ binder jetting technology designed to be the fastest way to 3D print metal parts at scale. The Production System platform consists of the P-1 and the P-50 printer models, enabling customers to scale from process and materials development in a smaller form factor solution to mass production of low-cost, end-use parts on the same print engine. On the Production System P-50, SPJ technology offers dramatic increases in print speeds up to 100 times those of legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies and the flexibility to use low-cost, third-party MIM powders. As a result, the Production System P-50, which is designed to achieve print speeds of up to 12,000 cubic centimeters per 

10



hour at a 65-micron printed layer height, can produce high-resolution parts at costs competitive with conventional mass production techniques for quantities up to hundreds of thousands of units, addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers and third-party contract manufacturers seeking cost-effective additive manufacturing solutions at scales required in industries such as automotive, consumer electronics, and consumer products. In addition, each of the Production System printer models feature an inert, chemically inactive processing environment, enabling support for a range of both non-reactive and reactive metals in a controlled fashion while also promoting consistent characteristics and quality across printed parts.
The Shop System platform introduces mid-volume binder jetting with rich feature detail and exceptional surface finish to the machine shop market. With the Shop System, which includes several configurations and build sizes and can achieve build speeds up to 10 times those of legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies, businesses can produce serial batches of hundreds or thousands of complex, end-use metal parts in a fraction of the time and cost of conventional manufacturing and comparably priced additive manufacturing technologies. It is an affordable, turnkey solution that facilitates the full manufacturing process from digital file to sintered metal part, and includes a powder station for part depowdering prior to sintering, closed-loop powder recycling and our proprietary furnace technology with software and profiles optimized for mid-volume production. While the Shop System was initially designed for metal parts production, we have also qualified and are commercializing this solution for additional material categories enabled by binder jetting, such as wood and ceramics.
The X-series platform is designed for serial production of binder jet 3D printed metal, ceramic, or composite parts, balancing speed and quality while offering broad material compatibility for a full spectrum of academics, researchers and manufacturers. The X-series, which consists of the X160Pro, X25Pro and InnoventX printer models, leverages patented Triple ACT technology to support high-resolution printing with industry-leading surface finish, final part accuracy, density and part variability as low at 0.3% across large build areas. Each of these printer models also features significant process flexibility, enabling the use of a range of ultra-fine, third-party MIM powders. The X-Series provides customers the ability to get started with binder jetting for academia, research and development, and small batch processing without the need for large quantities of powder on the compact InnoventX and scale to volume production of large, traditionally investment cast parts for applications in automotive, aerospace, and defense on the X160Pro, which is the largest commercially available binder jet system in the market and also features Industry 4.0 cloud connectivity and process-linking capabilities enabled by Siemens MindSphere. 
The Studio System platform is designed for office-friendly 3D printing using proprietary bound metal deposition, or BMD, technology in which loose powders and lasers, which are less user-friendly elements commonly associated with 3D printing, are eliminated in favor of bound metal rods to shape parts layer-by-layer. Integrated through Desktop Metal’s cloud-based Fabricate software, this turnkey, easy-to-use solution delivers a streamlined and automated workflow for producing low volumes of complex metal parts in house via additive manufacturing technology. Through BMD, the Studio System minimizes requirements for special facilities or expensive EHS equipment as compared to legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies and improves ease-of-use. Parts produced using the Studio System 2 also feature our proprietary Separable Supports technology, which enables simplified post-processing and support removal relative to legacy PBF additive manufacturing technologies.
We also offer the Desktop Metal Furnace, which can be paired with the Studio System and our entry-level binder jetting solutions to create turnkey metal additive manufacturing solutions that are simple to install and easy to use, making metal additive manufacturing significantly more accessible to businesses with no prior powder metallurgy experience. The Desktop Metal Furnace is fully-automated, sized to fit through ADA-compliant doors and built using proprietary technology that provides industrial-strength, vacuum-enabled sintering in an office-friendly package. It is designed to achieve temperatures up to 1,400 degrees Celsius and to ensure uniform heating and cooling without the residual stresses introduced into parts by legacy PBF additive manufacturing processes, which can result in poor part performance. 
Photopolymer Additive Manufacturing Systems
Our photopolymer additive manufacturing systems are designed using advanced, area-wide photopolymer print processes in which liquid photopolymer resin is cured using light from a high-resolution projector system to produce precision polymer parts with smooth surface finish and properties in line with or exceeding conventionally manufactured thermoplastics.
The Xtreme 8K platform features the largest build area among production-grade DLP systems. It is designed for industrial, high-temperature production of end-use photopolymer parts and uses high-powered light sources coupled with a water-cooled DLP chip for extended life on the factory floor. Leveraging patented Projection Array technology, the Xtreme 8K combines its two high-powered
