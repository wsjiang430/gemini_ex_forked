Dental Industry, Sales and Distribution
The Company believes that the dental industry is attractive and will grow over the long-term based on the following factors:
•Increasing worldwide population, including a shift towards aging demographics, which will require greater dental care.
•Natural teeth are being retained longer - individuals with natural teeth are much more likely to visit a dentist than those without any natural teeth.
•Increasing demand for aesthetic dentistry and the use of aligners as an orthodontic treatment.
•Continued opportunities in emerging markets related to the rise in discretionary incomes making dental services an increasing priority.
•Increasing demand for single visit dentistry versus historical multi-visit procedure requirements, and for higher quality of patient care in terms of comfort and ease of product use and handling.
•Increasing demand for earlier preventive care - dentistry has evolved from a profession primarily dealing with pain, infections, and tooth decay to one with increased emphasis on earlier diagnosis, preventive care, and the role oral health plays in overall health.
•Increasing opportunity for digital collaboration between General Practitioners (“GPs”), specialists, labs, and patients is creating widening demand for fully integrated solutions such as cloud-based platforms and services facilitated by GPs.
•Increasing demand for more efficiency and better workflow in the dental office, including digital tools such as the enhanced power of diagnostic equipment through 3D imaging. The rapid pace of digital technology adoption including the digitization of clinical workflows is becoming a category standard versus traditional manual processes.
The Company is able to navigate macroeconomic challenges and is well positioned to execute on its strategy of enabling dentists to have superior integrated workflows through its robust market offerings in all key areas of dental procedures (implants, endodontic, restorative and aligners) as well as digital infrastructure (CAD/CAM and imaging) utilized in dental practices around the globe.
As of December 31, 2022, Dentsply Sirona employed approximately 5,000 highly-trained, sales and technical staff specialized in each of our various products and solutions to provide comprehensive marketing, sales, and technical support services to meet the needs of our distributors, dealers and end-users.
Sales and Distribution
Dentsply Sirona distributes approximately two-thirds of its dental consumable and technology and equipment products through third-party distributors. Certain highly technical products such as dental technology equipment, dental ceramics, crown and bridge porcelain products, endodontic instruments and materials, orthodontic aligners and appliances, and dental implants are often sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets. Additionally, the Company’s Byte business produces aligners which are sold direct to consumers under doctor-directed, personalized treatment plans. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, no customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales or consolidated accounts receivable balance. Customers that accounted for 10% or more of net sales and accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020 were as follows: 

 | 2022 | | 2020 | | | 
 | % of net sales | | % of accounts receivable | | % of net sales | | % of accounts receivable | | | 
Henry Schein, Inc. | 11 | % | | 15 | % | | 14 | % | | N/A
Patterson Companies, Inc. | N/A | | 12 | % | | 10 | % | | 18 | % 

Although a significant portion of the Company's sales are made to distributors, dealers and importers, Dentsply Sirona focuses much of its marketing efforts on the dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, dental laboratories and dental schools which are the end-users of its products. As part of this end-user “pull through” marketing approach, the Company conducts extensive distributor, dealer and end-user marketing programs. Additionally, the Company trains laboratory technicians, dental hygienists, dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world. The Company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field.
Operating Principles
The Company's focus includes the creation of more meaningful solutions for dentists built around the following five key operating principles: 
•Approach customers as one: Put the customer at the center of how Dentsply Sirona is organized. The Company has an integrated approach to customer service, direct and indirect selling, and clinical education to strengthen the relationship with the customer and better serve the customers' needs.
•Create innovative solutions that customers love to use: A comprehensive R&D program that prioritizes strategic spending building the next generation of digital workflow technologies and service offerings, resulting in more impactful innovations each year.
•Think and act with positive intent and the highest integrity: Execute the business in a way that empowers our people, respects the communities in which we do business, and establishes trust with our partners and stakeholders.
•Operate sustainably in everything we do: Take a thoughtful, proactive approach to creating a sustainable company through investments in our employees, customers, and the environment.
•Use size and global breadth to our advantage: The Company is focused on integrating its dental product portfolios to unlock operational efficiencies, including performance improvements in procurement, logistics, manufacturing, sales force and marketing programs; and at the same time simplifying the business on a worldwide scale. In combination, these initiatives will improve organizational efficiency and better leverage the Company’s selling, general and administrative infrastructure.
Product Development
While the Company enjoys market leadership in several of its product categories, continuous innovation and product development are critical for it to continue to grow its share in markets it serves. Many of Dentsply Sirona’s existing products are undergoing brand extensions, and the Company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that have a more significant impact on how dental and clinical professionals treat their patients. In particular, the Company has continued to prioritize investments supporting digitally enhanced workflows through each stage of patient care, including imaging and scanning technologies used in diagnosis, treatment planning software, and customized products to deliver treatment. During 2022, the Company unveiled its cloud solution DS Core, an open platform developed in collaboration with Google Cloud that integrates digital dentistry workflows across its devices, services, and technologies. The DS Core digital platform is designed to enable more precise and simplified cloud storage, optimize diagnostic capabilities, and streamline existing workflows and collaboration with laboratory partners and specialists. Through R&D investments, the Company has accelerated a number of other new product developments during the year which enhance the digital dentistry offering for both equipment and consumables products. Innovations include the Company’s Primeprint Solution to provide medical-grade 3D printing, Primescan Connect which offers a laptop-based version of Primescan, the SmartLite Pro EndoActivator which serves as a new irrigation solution for root canal procedures, and the Axano treatment center combining smart design with efficient workflows. During the year, the Company also introduced its premium EV Implants System for providing implants that are harmonized, simplified and digitally enabled, as well as its enhanced orthodontic offering SureSmile Solutions that includes the addition of a whitening kit, retainers, and the VPro orthodontic device which uses high-frequency vibration to reduce discomfort in aligner treatment.
During 2021, product launches included software upgrades for CEREC and SureSmile introduction of PrimeTaper, a self-tapping implant with a tapered design; and ProTaper Ultimate, the next generation of endodontic files. The Company also acquired key supporting technologies in OSSIX bone regenerative collagen through the purchase of Datum Dental, and the new VPro aligner treatment devices through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Propel Orthodontics LLC ("Propel"). During 2020, the Company introduced Axeos, a new digital imaging product with a 3D wide field of view and Primemill, a time saving grinding and milling restoration machine. New products introduced within the past three years accounted for approximately 14% of 2022 sales.
R&D investments include activities to accelerate product and clinical innovation and discipline, and develop potential improvements to the manufacturing process. These investments also support engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement for current and next-generation products, with an objective to achieve more frequent development and release cycles. The Company also undertakes pre-commercialization trials and testing of technological improvements prior to inception of the manufacturing process. As is true across its other functions, the Company is continually transforming how R&D is conducted by identifying best practices, driving efficiencies, and optimizing cost structure to enable a more effective development process with a strategic focus on innovation process discipline. We are also looking to increasingly utilize an enterprise approach to funding that employs a returns-based mindset and allocates R&D spend towards those areas with the highest return.
In addition to internal product development, the Company also pursues external R&D opportunities, including acquisitions, licensing, or other arrangements with third parties. Initiatives to support technological development also include collaborations with research institutions and dental and medical schools. The Company annually supports the achievements of dental students conducting innovative research through its Student Competition for Advancing Dental Research and its Application Awards program. The Company is also committed to participation in clinical research demonstrating the efficacy of our products prior to market introduction, and in supporting the clinical education and technical training of dental professionals. Dentsply Sirona has 55 academies and education centers that are home to state-of-the-art training facilities for dental professionals who seek a comprehensive variety of clinical and technical continuing education curriculum. The academies offering hands-on teaching, live lectures, and on-demand webinars and courses which are taught by a diverse range of internationally known experts in all fields of dentistry. The Company provides over 7,000 training courses through our DS Academy annually, with approximately 300,000 dental professionals participating.
Through our internal research centers as well as through our collaborations with external research institutions, dental and medical schools, the Company directly invests in the development of new products, improvement of existing products and advances in technology. These investments include an emphasis on research in digital data sharing technology, including the incorporation of long-term artificial intelligence and machine learning. The continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the Company’s strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry. The Company’s long-term plans for investment in product development include an objective to maintain a level of R&D spend that is at least 4% of annual net sales with a focus on innovation and expansion of digital, software, services, and other platform offerings.
Acquisition Activities
Dentsply Sirona believes that the dental technology and consumable products industries continue to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution, although they remain fragmented thereby creating a number of acquisition opportunities.
The Company views acquisitions as a key part of its long-term growth strategy. These acquisition activities are intended to supplement the Company’s organic growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business to capitalize on significant growth drivers, including new technologies, additional products, organizational strength and geographic breadth. During the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased Datum Dental, Ltd., a producer and distributor of specialized regenerative dental material based in Israel, which provided the Company with a key technology to serve the implants markets. The Company followed in the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021 with the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Propel, a U.S. based company which manufactures and sells orthodontic devices and provides in-office and at-home orthodontic accessory devices, this investment is expected to further accelerate the growth and profitability of the Company's combined aligners business. In the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of a partially owned affiliate based in Switzerland that primarily develops highly specialized software, which is expected to further accelerate the development of the Company's specialized software related to CAD/CAM systems. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made various investments, including the acquisition of Byte, a direct-to-consumer aligners business, which complements the Company's existing aligner product by adding a digital component and is expected to enhance scale and accelerate the growth of the Company's combined aligners business going forward. This acquisition was representative of the Company's strategy of matching technological advancement in digital dentistry with innovative marketing and delivery in order to reach areas of high-growth potential for customer demand. For more information regarding the Company's acquisition activity, refer to Note 6, Business Combinations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Operating and Technical Expertise
Dentsply Sirona believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success. The manufacturing processes of the Company’s products require substantial and varied technical expertise. Complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the Company’s products. Where the Company can improve quality and customer service and lower costs, we endeavor to automate our global manufacturing operations.
Financing
Information about Dentsply Sirona’s working capital, liquidity and capital resources is provided in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K.
Competition
The Company conducts its operations, both domestic and foreign, under highly competitive market conditions. Competition in the dental and healthcare consumable products and dental technology and equipment products industries is based primarily upon product performance, quality, safety and ease of use, as well as price, customer service, innovation and acceptance by clinicians, technicians and patients. Dentsply Sirona believes that its principal strengths include its well-established brand names, its reputation for high quality and innovative products, its leadership in product development and manufacturing, its global sales force, the breadth of its product line and distribution network, its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the Company’s products by dental and medical professionals.
The size and number of the Company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some, but no competitor produces all of the same types of products as those produced by the Company.
Regulation 
The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the Company’s products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S. The following sections describe certain, but not all, of the significant regulations that apply to the Company. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that the Company is subject to, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
 The majority of the Company’s products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (“MDD”) (1993) in the European Union ("EU"), which will be updated to the EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) in 2021 (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder) and similar international laws and regulations. The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the U.S., to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Certain medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.
Dental and medical devices sold by the Company in the U.S. are generally classified by the FDA into a category that renders them subject to the same controls that apply to all medical devices, including regulations regarding alteration, misbranding, notification, record-keeping and good manufacturing practices. In the EU, the Company’s products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states, which are based on a Directive of the European Commission. Such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations. The Company products in Europe bear the CE mark showing that such products comply with European regulations. The Company’s products classified by EU MDD were mandated to be certified under the new MDR. These regulations also applied to all medical device manufacturers who market their medical devices in the EU and all such manufacturers had to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under EU MDR in order to continue to sell those products in the EU. Although all medical device manufacturers were required to certify their Class I (as defined in the EU MDR regulations) products by May 2021, the EU MDR regulations for additional Classes of medical devices is mandated to be fully enforceable by May 2024. This also includes completion of certified quality management systems to manufacturers quality management systems. The Company remains focused on ensuring that all its products that are considered to be medical devices will be fully certified as required by the EU MDR dates and timelines. 
Recently, the Chinese government launched a national program for volume-based, centralized medical device and consumables procurement with minimum quantity commitments in an attempt to negotiate lower prices from drug manufacturers and reduce the price of medical devices and other products. Under the program, the government will award contracts to the lowest bidders who are able to satisfy the quality and quantity requirements. The successful bidders will be guaranteed a sale volume for at least a year, giving the winner an opportunity to gain or increase market share. The volume guarantee is intended to make manufacturers more willing to cut their prices in order to win a bid and may also enable successful bidders to lower their distribution and commercial costs. Many types of drugs are covered under the program, including drugs made by international pharmaceutical companies and generics made by domestic Chinese manufacturers. The program, which is anticipated to take effect in the first half of 2023, could in the future result in reduced margins on covered devices and products, required renegotiation of distributor arrangements, and incurrence of inventory-related charges. The Company currently expects that sales of our Implants products in China will be negatively affected by price reductions.
The Company is also subject to domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders regarding anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the UK’s Bribery Act 2010 (c.23), Brazil’s Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12,846) China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission (“NHFPC”) circulars No. 40 and No. 50, and similar international laws and regulations. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some of the Company’s customer relationships are with governmental entities and therefore may be subject to such anti-bribery laws. The AKS and similar fraud and abuse laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a health care program, such as, in the U.S., Medicare or Medicaid. 
The Company’s production and sale of products is further subject to regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various environmental regulations such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and others enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or equivalent state agencies, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Health Care Reform Law”). In the sale, delivery and servicing of the Company’s products to other countries, it must also comply with various domestic and foreign export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and similar international governmental agencies, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the respective government. Despite the Company’s internal compliance program, policies and procedures may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees or agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment. Due in part to its direct-to-consumer model, the Company’s Byte aligner business in the U.S. is subject to various state laws, rules and policies which govern the practice of dentistry within such state. Byte contracts with an expansive nationwide network of independent licensed dentists and orthodontists for the provision of clinical services, including the oversight and control of each customer’s clinical treatment in order to comply with these regulations and ensure that the business does not violate rules pertaining to the corporate practice of dentistry.
The Company is subject to domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders governing data privacy and transparency, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), China’s Personal Information Protection Law, the Physician Payments Sunshine Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the EU Directive 2002/58/EC (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder), France’s Data Protection Act of 1978 (rev. 2004) and France’s Loi Bertrand, certain rules issued by Denmark’s Health and Medicines Authority, and similar international laws and regulations. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the GDPR and similar data-privacy laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions, restrict the use and disclosure of personal health information, mandate the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information and require us to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information. The Physician Payments Sunshine Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act require the Company to record all transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.
The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate its business. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, sanctions. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional detail.
Sources and Supply of Raw Materials and Finished Goods
The Company manufactures the majority of the products that it sells. The Company sources the necessary raw materials from various suppliers, and no single supplier accounts for more than 10% of our supply requirements.
Intellectual Property
Products manufactured by Dentsply Sirona are sold primarily under its own tradenames and trademarks. Dentsply Sirona also owns and maintains more than 5,000 patents throughout the world and has also licensed a number of patents owned by others.
Our policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations both in the U.S. and in significant international markets. The Company monitors trademark use worldwide and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the Company. Dentsply Sirona believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the Company’s marketing position but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The purpose of our employee resource groups is to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment enabling employees to bring their best to work as they participate in successfully executing our strategy. As of December 31, 2022, our employees have led the successful establishment of seven employee resource groups consisting of approximately 2,000 members from across the globe. Our employee resource groups focus on developing talent, increasing employee engagement, and creating awareness through allyship. We consistently recognize high participation in employee resource group-led events.
Training and Awareness
We offer a catalog of on-demand diversity, equity & inclusion training options aimed at strengthening awareness. A standout offering is our ongoing “Conversations of Understanding” sessions. Employees are invited to register for these small group discussions where internal volunteers share experiences on varying diversity, equity, & inclusion topics to generate healthy discussion and awareness.
Talent Acquisition
Our organization has talent sourcing guidelines requiring diverse and internal candidate interview slates for Director-level and above roles. To increase internal mobility, we offer career development options and utilize our talent review processes to highlight diverse talent. We educate our hiring managers on inclusive hiring practices.
Measuring Progress
Our executive leadership team regularly monitors and actions on diversity metrics, including attraction, engagement, advancement, and retention of diverse talent. We actively partner with an external consultancy to identify available talent pools in all our geographic markets and establish benchmarks for diverse representation across function, geography and level. All executive leaders create annual action plans and progress is reviewed quarterly.
Employee Health & Safety Matters
The health and safety of our employees are of utmost importance to us. We have a dedicated Employee Health & Safety ("EHS") program that provides global processes and trainings and monitors our progress against set goals. Our actions are in line with EHS frameworks and certifications such as OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001. We also have a Corporate Crisis Management Team, prepared to respond to crisis situations we may be confronted on a global scale with in a prompt and efficient manner.
Other Factors Affecting the Business
The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations in demand due to price changes, marketing and promotional programs, management of inventory levels by distributors, and implementation of strategic initiatives which may impact sales levels in any given period. Demand can also fluctuate based on the timing of dental tradeshows where promotions are offered, major new product introductions, and variability in dental patient traffic, which can be exacerbated by seasonal or severe weather patterns, or other demographic disruptions such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Some dental practices in certain countries may also delay purchasing equipment and restocking consumables until year-end due to tax planning which can impact the timing of our consolidated net sales, net income and cash flows. Sales for the industry and the Company are generally strongest in the second and fourth quarters and weaker in the first and third quarters, due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.
Although the backlog on products is generally not material to the financial statements due in part to the Company's efforts to maintain short lead times within its manufacturing, levels can fluctuate and affect sales in certain periods due to supply chain disruption and unavailability of required inputs.
