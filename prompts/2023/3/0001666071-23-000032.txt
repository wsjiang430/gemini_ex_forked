ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our company's mission is to make commerce smarter and rewarding for everyone. We work to accomplish this mission by operating an advertising platform within our own and our partners' digital channels, which include online, mobile applications, email, and various real-time notifications (the "Cardlytics platform"). We also operate a customer data platform that utilizes point-of-sale ("POS") data, including product-level purchase data, to enable marketers, in a privacy-protective manner, to perform analytics and targeted loyalty marketing and also enable marketers to measure the impact of their marketing (the "Bridg platform"). The partners for the Cardlytics platform are predominantly financial institutions ("FI partners"), that provide us with access to their anonymized purchase data and digital banking customers. The partners for the Bridg platform predominantly are merchants ("merchant data partners") that provide us with access to their POS data, including product-level purchase data. By applying advanced analytics to the purchase data we receive, we make it actionable, helping marketers, reach potential buyers at scale, and measure the true sales impact of their marketing spend. We have strong relationships with leading marketers across a variety of industries, including retail, restaurant, travel and entertainment, direct-to-consumer, and grocery and gas. 
Our purchase intelligence, coupled with our access to customers using our and our partners’ digital channels, enables us to help solve fundamental problems for marketers. Marketers increasingly have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their own stores, websites and loyalty programs. However, they lack insight into their customers’ purchase behavior outside of their stores and websites, as well as the purchase behavior of individuals who are not yet their customers. The reality is, no matter how robust their own customer data, marketers only see a small portion of their customers’ overall spending patterns. As a result, it is difficult for businesses to focus their marketing investments on the most valuable customers. With the Cardlytics platform, we enable marketers to reach potential customers across our network of FI partners through their digital banking accounts and present them relevant offers to save money when they are thinking about their finances. With the Bridg platform, we enable marketers to leverage their own POS data and reach their customers across a wide variety of digital advertising channels that they would not otherwise be able to identify and reach. Marketers are also challenged to measure the performance of their marketing. This issue is particularly acute with respect to measuring the impact of marketing on in-store sales, where the vast majority of consumer spending occurs. We believe our platforms transform purchase data into purchase intelligence, creating a disruptive opportunity to comprehensively address these challenges by enabling marketers to precisely measure how marketing drives both in-store and online sales through “closed loop-measurement.”
Solutions
The Cardlytics Platform
Through the Cardlytics platform, marketers can deliver advertising content to customers that allows them to earn rewards, which are funded with a portion of the fees we collect from marketers. Additionally, the Cardlytics platform benefits customers and enhances their overall experience by showing them relevant advertisements tailored to their spending patterns and specific interests. We maintain similar platforms in both the United States ("U.S.") and United Kingdom ("U.K.").
The Cardlytics platform helps marketers find potential new customers that are active in their category but not currently shopping with them, or to grow their business with existing customers. Our marketing is targeted and measured based on actual purchase data at a customer and account level. Unlike many other measurement solutions on which the marketing industry has historically relied, our measurements are not probabilistic or based on models, but are based on actual in-store and online purchases.
The breadth of our network of FI partners means that we are able to offer marketers the ability to optimize their marketing efforts to reach a large number of consumers through a single point of contact. The Cardlytics platform also provides our marketers a scalable solution for driving customer loyalty and engagement whereby Cardlytics handles everything from contracting with marketers and creating, managing and reporting performance of their campaigns to attributing incentives to each of our partners' customers.
The Cardlytics platform helps solve fundamental problems for our FI partners. Leveraging our powerful predictive analytics, we create compelling rewards that have the potential to drive deeper and more sustained use of the FI's digital channels, which we believe reduces customer attrition and increases use of the FIs’ credit and debit cards. Today, our FI partners include Bank of America, National Association ("Bank of America"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), as well as many other national and regional financial institutions, financial technology companies and virtual-only banks. We also partner with several of the largest bank processors and digital banking providers to help us reach customers of small and mid-sized FIs.

The Bridg Platform
The Bridg platform is a customer data platform, that utilizes POS data from our merchant data partners, including product-level purchase data to enable marketers to perform analytics and targeted loyalty marketing in a privacy protected manner. Bridg also enables marketers to measure the impact of their marketing. The Bridg platform's unique ability to identify, understand, and engage previously unreachable in-store customers is made possible through industry leading identity resolution, proprietary census of identity and characteristics, and unique strategic data partnerships.
Purchase Intelligence
Purchase Data from our FI Partners
Purchase data from our FI partners provides a secure view into where and when consumers are spending their money. The Cardlytics platform aggregates and analyzes purchase data without any personally identifiable information ("PII") leaving the FI or otherwise being made available to us. The data from the FI is anonymized so that it cannot be associated with any one individual. In the U.S., the Cardlytics platform ingests approximately one in every two debit and credit card transactions. This data allows us to serve relevant advertisements to our FI partners’ customers through our native bank advertising channel. We also leverage the power of purchase intelligence to provide marketers utilizing the Cardlytics platform with valuable insights into the preferences of their actual or potential customers wherever they shop.
Point-of-Sale Data from our Merchant Data Partners
Using POS data from our merchant data partners and our proprietary bureau of offline identity information, the Bridg platform associates customer purchases with developed identifiers. We then build privacy-protective profiles that include product-level purchase history and hundreds of customer attributes to enable marketing and analytics.
Advanced Analytics Capabilities
The advanced analytics we apply to our unique purchase datasets are what transforms them into valuable purchase intelligence. We use sophisticated quantitative methods to quickly access our massive volumes of data and make sense of what has happened—and, importantly, what is likely to happen. Our analytics makes our data actionable, enabling us to develop insights that marketers and partners rely on to make more informed business decisions and more meaningful customer connections.
Since we are able to measure the impact marketing campaigns have on in-store and online sales, marketers can use our purchase intelligence to optimize their advertising efforts and increase their investment in the Cardlytics and Bridg platforms to enhance future campaigns. Given our granular view into consumer spending across all categories, we can also help marketers identify share shift against their competition and learn more about where else their customers spend their money.
For our FI partners, we use our analytics to optimize the offers we display to customers within our Cardlytics platform. By assigning relevancy scores to each offer based on what customers are most likely to buy, our Cardlytics platform can present the most relevant offers earlier in customers’ mobile and online banking sessions. This increases the likelihood that customers activate, redeem, and earn more cash back on the things they care about most. At the same time, marketers gain more opportunities to get valuable content in front of the right audience.
Privacy and Security
Cardlytics Platform
We have architected privacy and security into our systems and practices. A critical part of our strategy involves a design focused on gathering data without collecting, maintaining or using sensitive information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information or medical records. Our platforms are currently designed so that we do not receive or have access to any PII from our FI partners. We only target marketing against anonymized data and/or data that has undergone processing such that it is only linked to pseudonymous identifiers. This approach to privacy is intended to protect consumers. Our privacy and security standards have also been designed and implemented to meet the requirements of, and safeguard the reputations of, our partners and marketers, many of which are large, multinational corporations. These customers frequently audit our practices and engage in detailed assessments of our infrastructure.

Our Ad Server and Ads Manager form the core of the Cardlytics platform. The Ad Server is responsible for targeting and presenting offers, which are developed and designed within the Ads Manager. Each FI partner's Ad Server is either hosted at the FI partner’s data center behind the FI partner’s firewall or hosted by us on behalf of the FI partner. The Ad Server interfaces with our FI partners' systems to receive anonymized purchase data, assign a unique consumer ID to each FI partners' customer, which we call a Cardlytics ID, and aggregate this purchase data. The Cardlytics ID is then used to assign offers, measure redemptions, and in limited cases, validate certain online purchases via anonymously linking to a consumer’s digital media presence. The Ad Server also receives engagement data, such as impressions and activations related to each Cardlytics ID.
The Ads Manager is hosted in our data centers behind our firewall and is used to create, manage and publish marketing campaigns to each FI partner's Ad Server. The Ads Manager also provides a majority of the functionality for managing configuration settings within each Ad Server and the transfer of data between Cardlytics and our partners.
We have implemented a number of security controls. Our security environment has achieved both SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II certifications, and has been audited by third parties using standards, which include Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18), AICPA Auditing Standards Board-issued Statement on Quality Control Standard (SQCS) and Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS). Sensitive data is subject to encryption, anonymization, or de-identification depending on the use case and risk profile. We enhance network security through measures such as network segmentation, firewalls and network and host-based intrusion detection at critical network aggregation and ingress/egress points.
A cornerstone of our practices is transparency in data use and consumer choice. Our privacy policy outlines the types of data we collect and how we use it. Most of our FI partners maintain different types of "opt-out” features for any consumer wishing to opt out of the FI partners' rewards program on the Cardlytics platform.
Outside of the U.S., our privacy and data handling practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business, which may be more restrictive than the requirements that we are subject to in the U.S.
Bridg Platform
The Bridg platform was designed to comply with privacy laws and regulations throughout the U.S. The Bridg platform also has built-in privacy protections to ensure that data provided by clients is never sold or shared without their consent, and personal information relating to newly identified consumers is never shared with the clients. Further, as we seek to deploy the Bridg platform outside the U.S., we will utilize appropriate practices to ensure compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other like data protection regimes.
Competitive Strengths
We have the ability to reach and influence real buyers at scale and measure the true impact of our campaigns on in-store and online sales. We believe that the following strengths provide us with competitive advantages:
•Significant Scale with FI Partners and Deeply Embedded Solution. We are generally the exclusive provider of native bank channel digital advertising to our FI partners as their digital channels are typically not conducive to supporting marketing content from multiple vendors. Our ability to connect and support multiple banks as a single vendor provides network scale that would otherwise be impossible for a single bank to achieve. Further, advertising within FIs' digital channels requires deep technological integrations, which we believe increases the cost of switching or supporting multiple vendors and therefore increases partner loyalty to us.
•Valuable Touchpoints with Customers of our FI Partners. The Cardlytics platform enables marketers to reach consumers in a secure, brand-safe, and digitally engaging environment, when they are thinking about their finances. We have access to consumers through both online and mobile channels and are increasingly reaching them through various other channels, including emails and real-time notifications.
•Massive Reach Informed by Purchase Intelligence. During 2022, the Cardlytics platform analyzed approximately $4.1 trillion in purchases across all categories, and geographies, both online and in-store. We have access to purchase data on the Cardlytics platform in the form of credit, debit, ACH and bill pay transactions. We provide marketers with the opportunity to leverage this unique data set to precisely reach millions of consumers. The Bridg platform gives marketers the ability to leverage insight of their own POS transactional purchase data to better understand their customers, inform their marketing strategies and measure the impact of their marketing.

•Significant Scale with Marketers due to consumer insights and Compelling Return on Advertising Spend. We provide compelling return on advertising spend due to our ability to influence likely buyers through our insights into consumer purchase data. This allows us to serve marketers at scale across a variety of industries, including retail, restaurant, travel and entertainment, direct-to-consumer, and grocery and gas. By serving these marketers at scale, we have developed deep insight into consumer behavior, which has allowed us to optimize how we reach and influence likely buyers.
•Powerful, Self-Reinforcing Network Effects. We see significant network effects within the Cardlytics platform. Adding new marketers and increasing the potential incentives provided to our FI partners’ customers increases engagement within our FI partners’ digital channels. This, in turn, attracts more FI partners to our platforms, adding to our scale, and making our platforms more valuable to marketers.
•Ability to Improve Marketing. Consumers spend a vast majority of their money in physical stores, and marketers have long sought efficient and effective ways to understand online-to-offline attribution. Likewise, although marketers may have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their stores and on their websites, they lack visibility about these customers’ overall spending patterns and the purchasing behavior of other likely buyers. Through the Cardlytics and Bridg platforms, we reach and influence real buyers at scale and measure the true, incremental impact marketing campaigns have on in-store and online sales. Our targeting capabilities allow marketers to tailor their campaigns to align with their marketing strategies.
•Proprietary Technology Architecture and Advanced Analytics Capabilities. We have designed the Cardlytics platform to protect highly sensitive first-party data. Our proprietary, distributed architecture helps facilitate both the effective delivery of our solution and the protection of our FI partners customers’ PII. No PII is shared by FI partners with Cardlytics and the data is anonymized so that it cannot be associated with any one individual. Our technologies leverage proprietary algorithms, to process raw purchase data into normalized purchase history useful for marketing and analytics. Our Cardlytics platform also supports integration of data from third-party sources to enrich the intelligence that we provide. Further, we apply advanced analytics to continuously increase our intelligence capabilities and identify actionable behavior patterns for our marketers. Our advanced analytics capabilities are what transforms our unique purchase dataset into valuable purchase intelligence. We use sophisticated quantitative methods to quickly access our massive volumes of data and make sense of what has happened—and, importantly, what is likely to happen. Our analytics makes our data actionable, enabling us to develop insights that marketers and partners rely on to make more informed business decisions and more meaningful customer connections.
•Loyalty Tactics Beyond Loyalty Programs. The Bridg platform easily ingests POS data, allowing marketers to identify and reach previously unreachable customers. This allows marketers to utilize loyalty tactics across all of their customers and enjoy the same rich insights, targeted marketing capabilities, and closed loop measurement as digital brands.
•World-Class Management Team with Unique Combination of Backgrounds and Experiences. Our team’s extensive experience across banking, technology and marketing is invaluable in our ability to forge relationships with FI partners and market and understand the technical complexities inherent in building platforms that are transforming and disrupting the marketing industry.
Growth Strategies
The principal components of our strategy include the following:
•Grow our Business with Marketers. While we already work with many large marketers, our platforms currently capture only a small portion of their overall marketing spend. We intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing efforts to grow our share of advertising budgets from existing marketers and attract new brands, merchants and service providers both directly and through advertising agencies. We also intend to grow our business with new marketers in newer industry verticals such as travel and entertainment, direct to consumer, and grocery and gas. We also intend to continue growing the footprint of the Bridg platform through both new and existing merchant data partners.
•Continue to Innovate and Evolve our Platform. As we continue to grow our data assets and enhance our Cardlytics platform, we are also developing new solutions, greater automation and increasingly sophisticated analytical capabilities. Our innovation is also focused on evolving our offer formats and expanding the types of offers within the Cardlytics platform, including product-level offers sourced from Bridg’s merchant data partners that can be distributed and managed within the Cardlytics platform. As we have in the past, we plan to continue to work in close collaboration with our partners to develop new purchase intelligence-based analytic solutions to enable marketers to make more informed business decisions.

•Continue to Realize Synergies between the Cardlytics and Bridg Platforms. The acquisition of Bridg allows for synergies with the current Cardlytics platform by creating more relevant offers, and more targeted segments, that can drive higher redemptions, increase consumer engagement, and generate greater advertiser demand. We believe integrating the Cardlytics and Bridg platforms has the potential to enable more effective media measurement (power promotional effectiveness across in-store and online channels), price and promotion optimization, more optimal partner relationships and further international expansion.
•Drive Growth through Existing FI Partners. We intend to increase customer adoption by improving the effectiveness of our FI partners’ digital channels. We continually work with our FI partners to improve their customers’ user experience, increase customer awareness and leverage additional customer outreach channels like email and alerts. We believe this organic increase in our monthly active users will drive growth.
•Expand the Network of Partners. We will continue to focus on growing our network of partners by integrating directly with FI partners, non-bank partners, merchant data partners and by opportunistically reselling our solution through financial processors and payment networks. Each new partner increases the size of our data asset, increasing the value of the Cardlytics and Bridg platforms to both marketers and our existing partners, which we believe will drive growth.
•Grow the Platform Through Integrations with Partners. We intend to continue to partner with other media platforms, marketing technology providers, merchant data providers and agencies that can utilize our platforms to serve a broad array of customers. In addition to focusing on the integration of the Cardlytics and Bridg platforms, we intend to focus on continued technological integration of our platforms with those of other complementary market participants.
Partners
We define a partner as a separate contracting entity from which we access data to empower our platforms either directly or through a third-party intermediary, such as a bank processor, digital banking provider or payment network operator. The partners for the Cardlytics platform are predominantly FI partners that provide us with access to their anonymized purchase data and digital banking customers. We generally pay our partners on the Cardlytics platform a Partner Share, which is a negotiated and fixed percentage of our billings to marketers less any Consumer Incentives that we pay to the partners’ customers and certain third-party data. FI partners that become part of our network through bank processors and digital banking providers may terminate their relationships with these bank processors and digital banking providers and thereby indirectly terminate their relationships with us. Our agreements with our FI partners generally include an automatic renewal feature. The partners for the Bridg platform are merchant data partners that provide us with access to their POS data, including product-level purchase data.
Agreements with Bank of America
Our relationship with Bank of America is governed by a General Services Agreement ("GSA") pursuant to which we provide Bank of America with access to the Cardlytics platform and certain other related services, and a related Statement of Work, which grants Bank of America the right to use the software underlying the Cardlytics platform. The GSA and Statement of Work extends through July 31, 2025, and Bank of America may terminate the GSA and Statement of Work at any time upon 90 days’ written notice.
Pursuant to the GSA with Bank of America, we provide the Cardlytics platform to Bank of America customers which includes forming relationships with participating marketers; obtaining and publishing marketer offers to customers after screening both the marketer and specific advertising content; and monitoring redemption rates with respect to Consumer Incentives offered in Cardlytics campaigns. Although we are primarily responsible for securing marketers to advertise on the Cardlytics platform, Bank of America may likewise secure marketers and share a portion of billings with us. Bank of America has the right to approve all marketer offers to be presented to Bank of America customers on the Cardlytics platform. Bank of America may terminate the Master Agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice. The GSA will automatically renew for 12-month periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the GSA.
Under the GSA, we share the revenue that we generate from the sale of advertising within the Bank of America channel with Bank of America, subject to certain exceptions. The amounts that we pay to Bank of America in excess of Consumer Incentives are reflected as Partner Share. The specific Partner Share percentage that we pay is based on whether we or Bank of America have secured the relevant marketer account and other marketer- and transaction-specific factors, provided that we are entitled to retain a minimum percentage of the monthly revenue subject to the GSA.

Agreements with Chase
In May 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement and Schedule #1 to the Master Agreement (collectively, the “Master Agreement”) with Chase, pursuant to which we provide Chase with access to the Cardlytics platform. Under the Master Agreement, we provide Chase with access to the Cardlytics platform through November 2025. Chase may terminate the Master Agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice. The Master Agreement will automatically renew for 12-month periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Master Agreement.
Under the Master Agreement, we share billings that we generate from the sale of advertising within the Chase channel with Chase, subject to certain exceptions. The amounts that we pay to Chase in excess of Consumer Incentives are reflected as Partner Share. The specific billing share percentage that we pay is based on whether we or Chase have secured the relevant marketer account and other marketer- and transaction-specific factors, provided that we are entitled to retain a minimum percentage of the monthly revenue subject to the Master Agreement. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are focused on growing our share of advertising budgets from existing marketers and attracting new brands, merchants and service providers both directly and through advertising agencies. Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing brand awareness for Cardlytics and Bridg through partnerships, public relations, industry events and publications. Our partner-focused account management team is focused on deepening relationships with existing partners and expanding our network.
We have dedicated sales teams responsible for establishing relationships with marketers and their agencies. Our sales teams are organized by industry, which include retail, restaurant, travel and entertainment, direct-to-consumer, grocery and gas. Each industry team is led by an experienced sales manager and staffed with sales, sales support and service specialists who have deep domain knowledge and industry operating experience. We also have account managers that manage our customer relationships within each industry.
We also have a dedicated partner sales team focused on expanding our network by both nurturing our existing relationships and cultivating new relationships with FI partners. Our partner sales team helps drive adoption of our solution offerings and partners with FIs to develop curated content and enhancements to the user experience for FI partners’ customers to drive increased engagement with the Cardlytics Platform.
Competition
The market for utilizing purchase intelligence to power marketing decisions is still emerging, and we believe we are one of the only companies that can provide purchase intelligence with the scale and the level of granularity that is equivalent to ours. We believe that we are the only company with scale that leverages purchase data to enable marketing through FI partner channels at scale, although we believe we currently have competition from other companies that deliver similar solutions on a smaller scale. In the future, we may face greater competition from other bank service providers, online retailers, credit card companies, digital publishers and mobile pay providers with access to a substantial amount of consumer purchase data. There also may be companies with access to FI data that do not enable marketing through FI partner channels at scale today that may be able to do so in the future. While we may successfully partner with a wide range of companies that are, to some extent, currently competitive to us, these companies may become more competitive to us in the future. As we introduce new solutions, as our existing solutions evolve and as other companies introduce new products and services, we are likely to face additional competition.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
•ability to leverage purchase data to inform marketing;
•depth and breadth of relationships with partners, marketers and their agencies;
•depth and breadth of, and access to, purchase data;
•effectiveness in increasing return on advertising spend for marketers;
•effectiveness in increasing marketing campaign performance for marketers and their agencies;
•effectiveness in increasing partner customer engagement;
•ability to maintain confidentiality and security of partner transaction data;
•transparency into and measurement of marketing performance;
•multi-channel capabilities;
•pricing;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•ability to continue to innovate; and
Table of Contents

•ability to attract, retain and develop leading-edge sales, account management, analytical and technical talent.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider and innovator of purchase intelligence.
The Bridg platform competes with other companies that operate enterprise customer data platforms. Additionally, Bridg competes or may in the future compete against monoline companies that provide advertising and data solutions such as profile unification or marketing campaign management and analytics, as well as data provisioners, brokers and cooperatives that provide advertising analytics to clients.
Intellectual Property
Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2022, we had eight issued patents relating to our software. We cannot assure you that our patents will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Our patents may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringements.
We have registered, or are registering, the "Cardlytics," "Dosh," "Bridg" and "Entertainment" names and logos in the U.S. and certain other countries. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the U.S. and other countries; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.
We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include cardlytics.com, dosh.com, bridg.com, entertainment.com and similar variations on those names.
In order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, financial institution partners, marketers, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, which would prevent us from being able to assert trade secret, rights or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platforms infringes their proprietary rights.
Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our partners, which we typically indemnify against such claims. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.
Seasonality
Our cash flows from operations vary from quarter to quarter, largely due to the seasonal nature of our marketers’ advertising spending. Many marketers tend to devote a significant portion of their marketing budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with consumer holiday spending and reduce their marketing budgets in the first quarter of the calendar year.

Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 501 full-time employees, including 63 in delivery, 200 in sales and marketing, 148 in research and development and 90 in general and administrative. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Human Capital Resources and Management
Our company's mission is to make commerce smarter and rewarding for everyone, and we know this starts with investing in each of our employees. Headquartered in Atlanta, GA with additional offices in New York, NY; Palo Alto, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Austin, TX, Detroit, MI; Champaign, IL and London, U.K, our employees are a big part of what drives our exceptional desire to win and help our advertisers and partners win.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) is integrated in everything we do. This mindset starts at the top, a significant part of our company goal of creating a “Great place where great people want to be.” DEI is embedded in each aspect of the talent lifecycle: attraction, recruitment, onboarding, development and retention. We build external relationships to ensure our talent pipelines are filled with candidates of diverse backgrounds. At the foundation of our DEI focus is our employee-led Special Interest Groups (“SIGs”). These groups facilitate learning and development, holistic wellness, professional connections, philanthropy, and raising awareness internally and externally for meaningful causes. Each group is sponsored by senior leaders in the organization. Cardlytics Connect, our newest SIG, focuses on our Black and Hispanic employees across the globe. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 42% of our global workforce is made up of women and 42% people of color.
A key component to our sustainability and success is talent development and learning. We are intentional in our efforts to provide all employees opportunities to grow. Additionally, we have introduced initiatives to give all employees access to learning content providers as well as experiencing success with programs for Educational Assistance and student loan reimbursement. Cardlytics University is a resource for both new hires as well as longer-tenured employees, and we have specialized curricula for emerging leaders, managers and mentors.
Our use of equity compensation allows our employees to operate as owners and is a key component of our total rewards strategy to retain, motivate and attract the best talent. We encourage our employees to think and act like shareholders, and they are invested in our success. Employee equity is the cornerstone in our compensation philosophy along with comprehensive medical benefits, a positive work/life ratio, unlimited paid time off, health and wellness programs, and learning and development opportunities. Each year, with the help of outside experts, we evaluate each aspect of compensation and benefits to ensure they are in alignment with the market and our peers.
As a purpose-driven company, we are focused on creating undeniable impact for partners while delivering real value to people, and our values reflect what drives our success. Our people and culture are our most valuable assets and greatest differentiators. We take initiative, are hungry to win, value transparency, and make it a priority to create a place where people want to be.
