ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Strategy
Our goal is to discover, develop and deliver therapeutics to defeat degeneration.
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of product candidates engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier (“BBB”) for neurodegenerative diseases and lysosomal storage diseases. We have a diversified and differentiated portfolio of both small molecule and biotherapeutic medicines, comprising seven product candidates in clinical development across eight indications as well as more than a dozen preclinical therapeutic candidates. Each of our programs has been engineered for efficient delivery across the BBB to increase drug exposure in the brain after systemic administration. We have discovered and developed a proprietary platform technology called the Transport Vehicle or “TV”, which we have used in developing our portfolio of brain-penetrant therapies based on our Enzyme Transport Vehicle (“ETV”), Antibody Transport Vehicle (“ATV”), Protein Transport Vehicle (“PTV”), and Oligonucleotide Transport Vehicle (“OTV”). We believe the combination of a clinically validated delivery platform and a maturing therapeutic portfolio will position us for long-term success in our goal to advance next-generation, targeted medicines for people living with neurodegenerative diseases. We plan to further grow our discovery and clinical development capabilities and intend to build internal manufacturing capabilities and commercial infrastructure in a staged manner that is aligned with the progression of our portfolio. We aim to serve patients as a fully integrated global organization.

In addition, we have initiated planning for a Phase 2/3 study of DNL343 (eIF2B activator) as part of the HEALEY Platform Trial in ALS. SAR443820/DNL788 is also being evaluated in a Phase 2 study for multiple sclerosis. We are conducting first-in-human studies of TAK-920/DNL919 (ATV:TREM2) for Alzheimer’s disease and TAK-594/DNL593 (PTV:PGRN) for frontotemporal dementia-granulin (“FTD-GRN”). SAR443122/DNL758 (peripheral RIPK1 inhibitor) is in two Phase 2 studies for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (“CLE”) and ulcerative colitis ("UC").
As our portfolio matures and our company scales, we plan to maintain a deep focus on science to guide our efforts to discover, develop and deliver medicines to patients. Our discovery and development strategy is guided by three overarching principles that we believe will significantly increase the probability of success and accelerate the timing to bring effective therapeutics to people living with neurodegenerative diseases: 
•Degenogene Pathways – each of our programs addresses a molecular target or biological pathway that is genetically validated to cause or increase the risk for neurodegenerative diseases.
•Engineering Brain Delivery – we engineer our product candidates to cross the BBB and act directly in the brain by following a rigorous approach in designing small molecules and by using our proprietary TV platform technology to effectively deliver large therapeutic molecules, such as enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and oligonucleotides, across the BBB after intravenous administration.
•Biomarker-Driven Development – we discover, develop and use biomarkers to inform dose selection, assess clinical activity, and identify patients most likely to respond to our therapies. 
Our target indications include diseases with large patient populations, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as rare indications, such as Hunter syndrome, FTD-GRN and ALS. We expect our first potential product launches will be in rare disease categories. Launching first in rare indications gives us the opportunity to build and establish our commercial organization so that we are poised for success in larger indications over time. Our most advanced TV-enabled program, DNL310 (ETV:IDS), is intended to replace the standard of care in Hunter syndrome, which belongs to a group of rare lysosomal storage diseases (“LSDs”). LSDs affect more than 30,000 individuals worldwide for whom central nervous system (“CNS”) manifestations and many peripheral symptoms continue to remain unaddressed by the current standard of care, if available at all. We aim to leverage certain efficiencies of scale to support the commercialization of additional product candidates to create an LSD franchise. We are actively working toward building clinical manufacturing capabilities and continuing to expand our commercial capabilities in LSDs and intend to serve patients directly in several countries. In parallel, we are advancing our programs for rare neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTD, which impact around 500,000 individuals worldwide. We may commercialize these product candidates, if approved, independently in key markets and/or leverage partnerships to ensure optimal access for patients. For the common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease, which afflict 40 to 50 million individuals worldwide, we plan to initially leverage strategic collaborations that contribute existing global commercial infrastructure.
Collaborations and partnering are central components of our strategy to build, develop and commercialize our portfolio of product candidates. We have numerous arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, technology companies, academic institutions, foundations, and patient-focused data companies. Notable active arrangements include those with Biogen Inc.’s subsidiaries, Biogen MA Inc. (“BIMA”) and Biogen International GmbH (“BIG”) (BIMA and BIG, collectively, “Biogen”), and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda"), and Genzyme Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A. ("Sanofi"). We hold significant development and commercialization rights to all of our CNS programs, including the programs which are subject to our collaboration agreements with Biogen, Sanofi and Takeda, where we share responsibility for clinical development and share commercialization rights in the United States and China. Our costs of developing programs associated with these collaborations are largely covered through upfront payments, expected incoming milestones and cost sharing. We may seek additional strategic partnering opportunities as we strive to capture the full value of our portfolio and platforms. For example, the TV platform has potential applications beyond our core focus on neurodegeneration (e.g., oncology, infectious disease, neuropsychiatry, pain).
At Denali, we are guided by the core Denali values of trust, growth, grit and unity, and these values form the foundation of our Environmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) practices. Our working culture seeks to develop quality leaders, foster diversity and inclusion, and emphasize continuous growth. We embrace differences and acknowledge the valuable perspectives that a diverse and inclusive workforce brings to problem-solving and innovation. We strive to manage our operations in a way that is sustainable and reduces our impact on the environment, including through a Green Alternative program which provides researchers with information on suitable alternative chemicals that have a lower environmental impact for common solvents. Additionally, several waste streams have been segregated on-site for proper disposal or recycling, such as containers, food waste, plastics, styrofoam, and glass chemical containers, to maximize recycling and composting. We also maintain an ongoing commitment to corporate governance principles, with oversight of ESG matters by Denali's Board of Directors, and strong performance orientation in our compensation program.
Our Approach to Defeating Neurodegeneration
Our Scientific Principles
Degenogene Pathways
The number of genetic associations discovered in neurodegenerative diseases has grown rapidly in recent years. Degenogenes are genes that when mutated cause, or are major risk factors for, neurodegenerative diseases. Analysis of recently discovered degenogenes point to important disease pathways that, when dysregulated, increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative disease, and provide a strong scientific foundation for prioritizing drug development programs. We currently focus on programs that seek to modulate three key disease pathways:
•Lysosomal Function – Dysfunction of the lysosomal system, the disposal and recycling compartment of the cell, is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and neurodegeneration in the context of LSDs. Degenogenes linked to lysosomal function include leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ("LRRK2"), progranulin ("PGRN"), alpha-synuclein ("aSyn"), and lysosomal enzymes, including iduronate 2-sulfatase ("IDS"), sulfamidase ("SGSH"), and glucocerebrosidase ("GBA").
•Glial Biology – Glial cells, the resident immune cells of the brain, serve various functions including supporting neuronal health, pruning neuronal synapses, and providing immune surveillance and response in the brain. Genetic and pathological data suggest that glial dysfunction significantly contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Degenogenes that implicate immune dysfunction in the brain include triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 ("TREM2") and receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 ("RIPK1"), a critical signaling protein in a canonical inflammatory and cell death pathway.
•Cellular Homeostasis – The brain is particularly susceptible to defects in lipid, protein or RNA homeostasis. Mutations in several ALS and FTD degenogenes alter RNA homeostasis and increase cellular stress. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 B ("eIF2B") is an essential regulator of cellular stress, and modulators of eIF2B activity have been shown to be beneficial in numerous in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative disease. Other degenogenes linked to cellular homeostasis include amyloid precursor protein ("APP"), Tau and Apolipoprotein E (“ApoE”).
Engineering Brain Delivery
Historically, the BBB has been a major challenge to the development of medicines for diseases of the CNS. While the BBB protects the brain from threats such as harmful substances and infections by tightly regulating transport of molecules into and out of the brain, the BBB also prevents the delivery of small- and large-molecule medicines to the brain in sufficient quantities to have therapeutic effect. We directly address the BBB challenge by engineering brain delivery for both small and large molecules. 
Most small molecules are actively excluded from the brain by efflux pumps at the BBB; it has been estimated that approximately 98% do not cross the BBB. We rigorously design our small molecule therapeutic candidates to be orally bioavailable with chemical and physical properties that enable them to be readily absorbed from the gut and to penetrate the BBB while avoiding transporter-mediated efflux.
We invented, developed, and continue to optimize a proprietary technology, called the Transport Vehicle, to deliver our large molecule biotherapeutic candidates to the brain after systemic administration. Clinical and preclinical studies with several of our TV-enabled product candidates demonstrated high concentrations and broad distribution in all explored regions of the CNS and in key CNS cell types and showed improved pharmacodynamic effects compared to standard biotherapeutics. We believe that the TV can significantly increase the probability of success of biotherapeutics for CNS indications and can enable many new potential treatment options.
Our TV technology is modular and enables several classes of biotherapeutics to more effectively cross the BBB, including enzymes, antibodies, proteins and oligonucleotides. The TV technology is engineered to engage specific BBB transport receptors, such as the transferrin receptor (“TfR”), which are highly expressed in brain capillaries and facilitate transport of proteins into the brain (Figure 1) in a process called receptor mediated transcytosis, or RMT.
Figure 1: Engineering brain delivery. Schematic of the TV technologies, designed to cross the BBB through receptor-mediated transcytosis, leveraging endogenous receptors expressed on endothelial cells of the central nervous system vasculature.
Our pipeline of TV-enabled programs currently includes three clinical-stage programs and more than a dozen programs in preclinical development. We demonstrated proof of concept with safety and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study with DNL310 (ETV:IDS), and pharmacokinetic data from the ongoing Ph1 study with DNL593, as well as data from several preclinical studies in mouse and nonhuman primate models. Preclinical studies demonstrated robust and sustained pharmacodynamic effects in the brain after intravenous dosing of TV-enabled antibodies, enzymes, proteins, and antisense oligonucleotides ("ASOs"), while standard antibodies, enzymes, proteins and ASOs had no or minimal pharmacodynamic effects. These data show that TV-enabled product candidates have the potential to achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in the brain after systemic administration, making them potentially superior to traditional biologic therapeutics in targeting neurodegenerative diseases.
Our TV technology is differentiated from other BBB technologies through its engineering approach, which may provide superior stability and safety and higher exposure of drug candidates in the brain (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Denali’s TV technology is modular and highly differentiated
Our most advanced TV-enabled program, DNL310 (ETV:IDS), is currently in an ongoing Phase 2/3 study, and we have advanced two additional TV-enabled molecules into clinical testing, namely, PTV:PGRN (TAK-594/DNL593) and ATV:TREM2 (TAK-920/DNL919). In addition, we plan to submit an IND application for another ETV-enabled molecule, DNL126 (ETV:SGSH) in the first half of 2023.
We believe that we can further expand our portfolio leveraging the modularity of the TV technology. In addition to our current focus on neurodegenerative diseases and LSDs, we are exploring programs in oncology (ATV:HER2) and infectious diseases as well as other neurological and neuromuscular indications (Figure 3). We may develop these additional programs ourselves in the future or seek partnerships.
Figure 3: Denali’s TV technology provides opportunities for platform expansion
Biomarker-Driven Development
As part of our strategy, we identify and validate biomarkers which are relevant for both animal models and human trials and are critical for selecting patients, predicting and measuring target engagement, supporting dose selection and enabling decisions on progression of product candidates to the next phase of development. When practicable, we are developing patient selection biomarkers for our programs to enable identification of patients with the relevant disease biology and stage of disease likely to benefit from targeted therapy in order to increase the likelihood of success of clinical trials. Ultimately, we expect to positively impact market acceptance of these targeted therapies, driven by high and meaningful response rates within the targeted population as defined by the patient selection biomarkers. In certain indications, regulatory approval may limit the market of a product candidate to target patient populations when patient selection biomarkers are used. In these indications, regulatory authorities may require us to run additional clinical trials prior to expanding the label for approval that includes a broader patient population.
Our Programs
The following table summarizes key information about our clinical programs and pipeline:
Figure 4: Denali’s current development pipeline
We are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our programs are at different stages of clinical and preclinical development. In addition to our current clinical development portfolio, we expect to advance at least three new molecule entities (“NMEs”) into clinical development in the 2023 to 2025 timeframe. We discuss our most advanced programs in further detail below.
Our Transport Vehicle (TV)-Enabled Programs
DNL310 ETV:IDS Enzyme Replacement Therapy Program for MPS II (Hunter Syndrome)
MPS II, also called Hunter syndrome, is a rare genetic disease that affects over 2,000 individuals, primarily males, world-wide, and leads to behavioral, cognitive, and physical symptoms ultimately resulting in shortened lifespan. MPS II is caused by mutations in the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene, which leads to a deficiency of the IDS enzyme. Symptoms often begin emerging around age two and include physical complications, including organ dysfunction, joint stiffness, hearing loss and impaired growth, and neurocognitive symptoms with impaired development. The disease is characterized by a buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes — the part of the cell that breaks down materials including GAGs. The current standard of care enzyme replacement therapy partially treats the physical symptoms but does not cross the blood-brain barrier, and as a result, cognitive and behavioral symptoms experienced by the majority of patients with MPS II are not addressed. Therapies that address behavioral, cognitive, and physical manifestations of the disease are one of the greatest unmet needs for this community.
DNL310 is an investigational fusion protein composed of IDS fused to Denali’s proprietary ETV, which is engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis into the brain. Preclinical studies demonstrate that DNL310 delivers IDS to lysosomes, where it is needed to break down GAGs. DNL310 is engineered for broad delivery of IDS into cells and tissues throughout the body, including the brain with the goal of addressing the behavioral, cognitive, and physical manifestations of MPS II. In March 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track designation to DNL310 for the treatment of patients with MPS II. In May 2022, the European Medicines Agency granted DNL310 Priority Medicines designation. DNL310 is an investigational product candidate and has not been approved by any Health Authority.
Based on supportive clinical and preclinical data to date, we are conducting the Phase 2/3 COMPASS study in North America, South America, and Europe (Figure 5). The Phase 2/3 COMPASS study is expected to enroll 54 participants with MPS II, with and without neuronopathic disease. The participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either DNL310 or idursulfase, respectively. Cohort A will include children ages ≥2 to <6 years with neuronopathic disease; cohort B will include children ages ≥6 to <17 without neuronopathic disease. Upon completion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study, and together with data from the global COMPASS study, this combined data package is intended to support registration.
Figure 5: DNL310 Phase 2/3 COMPASS Study design
In parallel with the Phase 2/3 COMPASS study, we are also conducting a Phase 1/2 trial for DNL310 in patients with MPS II as a multicenter, multiregional, open-label, single-arm trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of DNL310 administered once weekly by intravenous infusion. We have previously reported interim analyses from the Phase 1/2 study and most recently at the 2023 WORLD Symposium in February 2023. The presentation included data as of the September 2022 data cut off from the 28 participants enrolled in the Phase 1/2 study, all but one with neuronopathic MPS II, and having a median age of 5 years (range 2 to 12) at enrollment. Participants received weekly intravenous doses of DNL310 starting on day 1 of the study, with no wash-out period for those switching from idursulfase. Key results are summarized below.
The data reported at the 2023 WORLD Symposium continued to demonstrate that DNL310 enables rapid and sustained normalization of heparan sulfate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with mean reductions from baseline of 91% and 90% at weeks 24 and 49, respectively. Normalization of CSF heparan sulfate was observed even in participants with high levels of preexisting anti-iduronate-2-sulfatase antibodies.(Figure 6). 
Figure 6: Rapid normalization or near normalization of CSF HS was observed in all participants, was sustained at week 49, and remained normal in the three participants tested at week 104.
Sustained reduction of lysosomal lipid biomarkers in CSF was also observed, which is consistent with improved lysosomal function. At week 24, the mean decline in levels of gangliosides GM2, GM3, and glucosylsphingosine lipids were 64%, 54%, and 57%, respectively, which was sustained at week 49 (63%, 49%, and 48%, respectively). 
After switching from idursulfase to DNL310, a mean decline from baseline of 85% and 89% was observed for heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate biomarkers in the urine, respectively, at week 49, suggesting DNL310 has added peripheral activity over approved enzyme replacement therapy.
Exploratory clinical outcomes data from Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS)-II (Figure 7) and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID)-III assessments (Figure 8) were reported for the first time at the 2023 WORLD Symposium and positive mean changes in raw scores over one year with DNL310 treatment relating to adaptive behavior and cognitive skill gains were observed, respectively. These raw score results are consistent with previously reported one-year findings from the Clinician Global Impression Scales of Change and Caregiver Global Impression Scales of Change, showing that most participants demonstrated improvement or stabilization across all domains at week 49 of study treatment.
Hearing, as assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing, numerically improved over time after initiation of DNL310 across all frequencies. At week 49, ABR thresholds showed statistically significant improvements across three of the four frequencies, with a trend toward greater improvement at higher frequencies.
The safety profile of DNL310 remains consistent with standard of care, now with data up to two years of treatment with DNL310. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were infusion related reactions, which decreased in frequency and severity with continued dosing. An independent data monitoring committee met in October 2022 and recommended that the study may continue without modifications. 
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Presentation of additional interim Phase 1/2 data at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) Annual Symposium.
•Continued recruitment of participants with MPS II in the global Phase 2/3 COMPASS study.
Figure 7: Over 49 weeks, mean VABS-II raw scores increased across subdomains, including those particularly relevant to MPS families, reflecting adaptive behavior skill gain.
Figure 8: Mean increases were observed in BSID III Cognitive Raw Scores at Week 49 and were larger in magnitude when accounting for participants cognitively capable of completing the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children.
TAK-594/DNL593 (PTV:PGRN) Program for FTD-GRN
FTD is the most common form of dementia in people under 60 years of age. While the progression of symptoms varies by individual, FTD brings an inevitable decline in function together with changes in personality and social behaviors, and sometimes language and/or motor dysfunction. Mutations in the granulin ("GRN") gene, which encodes the PGRN protein, generally result in reduced levels of PGRN and are among the most common genetic causes of FTD. It is estimated that FTD-GRN is 5-10% of the total FTD patient population. There are currently no approved medicines to stop or slow the progression of FTD or FTD-GRN.
As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Takeda to co-develop and co-commercialize TAK-594/DNL593 (PTV:PGRN), an investigational, brain-penetrant PGRN replacement therapy enabled by Denali's PTV platform and designed to restore normal levels of PGRN in the brain without interfering with normal PGRN transport and processing. Preclinical proof of concept demonstrates that PTV enhances brain uptake of recombinant PGRN as well as uptake by multiple cell types in the brain, including neurons and microglia, as compared to non-TV PGRN. In addition, TAK-594/DNL593 rescued both neurodegeneration and microglial dysfunction in PGRN-deficient mice. Our improved mechanistic understanding of the role of PGRN in lysosomal function indicates that direct delivery of TAK-594/DNL593 to the brain may be an effective therapeutic approach to increase PGRN levels in lysosomes for the potential treatment of people with certain types of FTD, especially FTD-GRN caused by PGRN deficiency.
Together with Takeda, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TAK-594/DNL593 for FTD-GRN in 2022. Interim results from Part A of this study evaluating DNL593 in healthy subjects were presented at the Frontotemporal Dementia Prevention Initiative meeting in November 2022 and demonstrated that single doses of DNL593 resulted in substantial increases in CSF PGRN levels suggesting brain delivery of DNL593 was achieved and has the potential to address PGRN deficiency, which drives FTD-GRN disease progression (Figure 9). Single doses of DNL593 were generally well tolerated, based on blinded safety analysis. The data support the ongoing recruitment of participants with FTD-GRN in Part B (ascending multiple doses) of the Phase 1/2 study.
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Final data from Phase 1/2 Part A healthy volunteer study in mid 2023.
•Continued recruitment of participants with FTD-GRN in Part B (ascending multiple doses) of the Phase 1/2 study.
Figure 9: Dose-dependent increase in CSF PGRN in healthy volunteers with intravenous DNL593.
TAK-920/DNL919 (ATV:TREM2) Program for Alzheimer's disease
Dementia affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia accounting for 60-70% of cases. TREM2 is a receptor expressed on microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. Loss of function TREM2 genetic mutations are strongly associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease; therefore, activating the receptor could be an efficacious therapeutic strategy.
As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Takeda to co-develop and co-commercialize TAK-920/DNL919 (ATV:TREM2), an investigational, brain-penetrant TREM2 agonist enabled by Denali's PTV platform and designed to activate TREM2 and improve microglial function. Animal model data demonstrate enhanced brain uptake and biodistribution with TAK-920/DNL919 as compared to a non-ATV TREM2 antibody and improved pharmacodynamic response, including enhanced microglia metabolism and mitochondrial respiration (Figure 10).

Together with Takeda, we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers in the Netherlands in 2022 which is actively enrolling participants. In January 2022, we announced that the TAK-920/DNL919 Investigational New Drug ("IND") application had been placed on clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). We plan to continue to engage with the FDA and regulatory authorities in Europe to define the path forward for the TAK-920/DNL919 clinical program, including plans to advance into a Phase 1b study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Data from the Phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers by year-end 2023.
DNL126 (ETV:SGSH) Program for MPS IIIA (Sanfilippo Syndrome A)
DNL126 (ETV:SGSH) is our second most advanced ETV program following DNL310 (ETV:IDS). DNL126 is in development for the potential treatment of MPS IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome A), a rare lysosomal storage disease that causes fatal brain damage. MPS IIIA is caused by genetic defects that result in a reduction in the lysosomal activity of SGSH, an enzyme responsible for degrading heparan sulfates in the lysosome. There are no approved treatments for MPS IIIA. Preclinical data demonstrated that DNL126 reduced heparan sulfate in a dose-dependent manner in brain, cerebrospinal fluid and liver in an MPS IIIA model (Figure 11). Submission of an IND application is planned for the first half of 2023.
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Submission of an IND application in the first half and Phase 1/2 recruitment activities in the second half of 2023.
Figure 11: 12 weekly doses of ETV:SGSH reduces brain, CSF, and liver HS levels in a MPS IIIA mouse model.
DNL622 (ETV:IDUA) for MPS I (Hurler syndrome)
Alpha-L-iduronidase (“IDUA”) is an enzyme responsible for degrading heparan and dermatan sulfate in the lysosome. Genetic defects in IDUA result in a reduction or absence of lysosomal IDUA activity and cause Hurler syndrome (or MPS I), which is characterized by alterations in the skeleton, heart, respiratory system, and brain. DNL622 (ETV:IDUA) is a recombinant IDUA enzyme engineered to cross the BBB, to replace IDUA, and to treat the cognitive, behavioral and physical manifestations of the disease. DNL622 is currently in the IND-enabling stage of preclinical development. 
Oligonucleotide Transport Vehicle ("OTV") Platform
Oligonucleotides, such as ASOs, are a novel class of biotherapeutics with the potential to address the root cause of many diseases through modulation of gene expression. This class, however, has been limited in its potential for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, primarily due to the challenge of delivering effective amounts of drug to relevant brain regions. Direct injection into the CSF (e.g., intrathecal injection) or certain brain regions has not achieved the robust biodistribution into deep brain tissue, which may be necessary for effective therapeutic activity.
Nonhuman primate data demonstrated that intravenous delivery of an ASO enabled by our OTV technology resulted in broad brain biodistribution of the ASO (Figure 12) and knockdown of target gene expression in all brain cell types, which was superior to intrathecal administration of the ASO. These data support the potential of our OTV platform to enable peripheral administration of oligonucleotide therapeutics and to address a wide range of neurodegenerative and other neurological diseases. Denali has selected five ASO targets for further development with a near-term focus on advancing two OTV candidates towards clinical development (Figure 13). 
Figure 12: Broad brain biodistribution of an intravenously administered ASO enabled by our OTV technology (right) as compared to limited brain biodistribution of ASO delivered intrathecally (left).
Figure 13: OTV is designed to open a large potential indication space in neurodegeneration and beyond by enabling superior biodistribution of ASOs across brain regions, providing superior knockdown of target gene expression across all cell types, and enabling intravenous dosing of oligonucleotide therapeutics. Five ASO targets have been selected for further development with a near-term focus on advancing two OTV candidates towards clinical development.
Other TV-Enabled Discovery Programs
Our portfolio includes additional preclinical programs, including programs targeting amyloid beta ("Abeta") (“ATV:Abeta”) and HER2 (“ATV:HER2”). 
Targeting Abeta plaques in the brain has been investigated by the field as a therapeutic approach to treat AD, and two Abeta-targeted antibodies, lecanemab and aducanumab, have been approved by the FDA using the Accelerated Approval pathway. These accelerated approvals were based on clinical data demonstrating that treatment was associated with a reduction in the accumulation of Abeta plaque in the brain, a defining feature of AD.
Our ATV:Abeta utilizes the TV platform to enable increased brain exposure and target engagement of anti-Abeta. In preclinical studies in mice, we demonstrated a notable difference in ATV:Abeta localization with plaques, and quantification revealed up to a 17-fold increase in ATV:Abeta signal colocalization with plaques compared to a non-TV-enabled Abeta antibody. This significant increase in target engagement compared to the standard antibody could indicate potential for superior efficacy or an improved therapeutic window. Biogen has an exclusive option to license ATV:Abeta, which option may be exercised up to the initiation of IND-enabling studies.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ("HER2") is a growth factor receptor that is over-expressed in multiple cancers, including breast, colorectal, and gastric cancer. Up to half of patients diagnosed with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer have brain metastases for which limited treatment options exist. Using ATV, we have engineered mono- and bispecific formats of HER2 antibodies. In preclinical mouse studies, we have demonstrated improved anti-tumor activity of ATV-enabled HER2 antibodies in a HER2-positive peripheral tumor model. Our bispecific ATV:HER2 antibody demonstrated improved peripheral anti-tumor activity as compared to non-ATV HER2 antibodies as well as enhanced brain uptake as compared to a non-ATV HER2 antibody. The data support the potential for ATV:HER2 to treat HER2-positive peripheral tumors and brain metastases and to further validate the potential for TV applications in oncology.
Our Brain-Penetrant Small Molecule Programs 
BIIB122/DNL151 LRRK2 Inhibitor Program for Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is one of the most common brain diseases, affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide. It is commonly thought of as a movement disorder because patients can experience tremors, slowness of movement, stiffness and difficulty with walking and balance. In addition, Parkinson's patients can have other non-motor type problems such as constipation, depression and memory loss. The disease results from the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain and is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors.
Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are one of the most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is involved in maintaining a healthy cellular environment by regulating lysosomal function through modification of Rab proteins. Increased levels of LRRK2 kinase activity lead to lysosomal dysfunction, which contributes to neurodegeneration. Inhibition of LRRK2 activity may slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease in patients, with and without known genetic risks based on restoration of lysosomal function.
As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Biogen to co-develop and co-commercialize our small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2 for Parkinson's disease. BIIB122/DNL151 is the most clinically advanced small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 currently in clinical testing for Parkinson's disease. Results from Phase 1 and Phase 1b trials of BIIB122/DNL151 in healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease, respectively, showed robust target and pathway engagement as measured by pS935 LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 (“pRab10”), respectively. In addition, a dose-dependent reduction in urine of the lysosomal lipid 22:6-bis[monoacylglycerol] phosphate (“BMP”), a biomarker of lysosomal function, was achieved with BIIB122/DNL151 treatment, providing evidence supporting improvement of lysosomal function. BIIB122/DNL151 was generally well tolerated across a broad range of doses for up to 28 days, the longest treatment duration in both studies.
Biogen is conducting two global late-stage clinical trials of BIIB122/DNL151: the Phase 2b LUMA study, which commenced in May 2022 and is evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB122/DNL151 as compared to placebo in approximately 640 participants with early-stage Parkinson's disease; and the Phase 3 LIGHTHOUSE study in approximately 400 participants with Parkinson's disease with a confirmed LRRK2 pathogenic variant, which commenced dosing in September 2022.
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Continued recruitment of participants with Parkinson's disease in the Phase 2b LUMA and Phase 3 LIGHTHOUSE studies.
Other LRRK2 Compounds
Genetic and functional studies have linked LRRK2 and other proteins that modulate lysosomal function to Crohn's disease. Excessive LRRK2 activity leads to a reduction in lysosomal function, which contributes to the inflammation and intestinal dyshomeostasis that are characteristic of this disorder. We have discovered potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2 and have selected a lead clinical candidate (DNL975) for treatment of Crohn's disease. As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Biogen on the Peripheral LRRK2 program.
SAR443820/DNL788 RIPK1 Inhibitor Program for CNS Disease
As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Sanofi on the development of small molecules that inhibit RIPK1, a critical signaling protein in the tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) receptor pathway and a regulator of inflammation and cell death. Increased RIPK1 activity in the brain drives neuroinflammation and cell necroptosis and contributes to neurodegeneration. RIPK1 inhibition has been shown to have beneficial effects in preclinical models of ALS, multiple sclerosis (“MS”), Alzheimer's disease, and other diseases.
SAR443820/DNL788 is our lead CNS-penetrant RIPK1 inhibitor in clinical development. Sanofi completed a Phase 1 trial of SAR443820/DNL788 in healthy volunteers in which robust target engagement was demonstrated at doses that were generally well tolerated. In 2022, Sanofi commenced dosing in the HIMALAYA global Phase 2 study of SAR443820/DNL788 and expects to enroll approximately 260 participants with ALS. A Phase 2 study of SAR443820/DNL788 in MS was initiated in January 2023 and is expected to enroll approximately 168 patients. In addition, we are leading preclinical exploration of SAR443820/DNL788 as a potential treatment for AD.
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Completion of recruitment of participants with ALS in the Phase 2 HIMALAYA study.
•Ongoing recruitment of MS Phase 2 study. 
DNL343 eIF2B Activator Program for ALS
We are developing DNL343 as a novel eIF2B activator with first-in-class potential for the treatment of ALS and other indications. eIF2B is an intracellular protein complex that regulates protein synthesis and is required for neuronal health and function. When neurons experience stress, activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway leads to suppression of eIF2B activity, resulting in impaired protein synthesis and formation of stress granules. Stress granules are thought to be a precursor of TDP-43 aggregation, which is a hallmark pathology in ALS. DNL343 is designed to activate eIF2B and thereby restore protein synthesis, disperse TDP-43 aggregates, and improve neuronal survival. 
Results from a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that DNL343 was generally well tolerated for up to 14 days of dosing, with robust distribution in the CNS. Furthermore, biomarker assessments of DNL343 treatment confirmed ISR pathway engagement, demonstrating modulation of ISR-dependent genes and proteins in a dose-dependent manner.
We are conducting a Phase 1b multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 28-day trial followed by an 18-month open-label extension, designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DNL343 participants with ALS. Enrollment in the study is complete with 29 participants. An interim analysis was performed after 20 participants randomized to receive either DNL343 or placebo had completed the double-blind period of the study. The interim results demonstrated that once-daily oral dosing with DNL343 for 28 days was generally well tolerated and demonstrated extensive BBB penetration as well as robust inhibition of biomarkers associated with the ISR pathway (ATF4 protein levels and CHAC1 gene expression) in blood samples from study participants at both doses levels of DNL343 (Figure 14). 
Figure 14: An interim analysis (n=20) from the ongoing Phase 1b study demonstrated 28-day dosing with DNL343 reduced ISR biomarkers in blood samples from ALS patients.
The data to date continue to support late-stage development of DNL343. The design phase of the DNL343 regimen is underway for entry into the Phase 2/3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial led by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS ("Healey Center") at Massachusetts General Hospital ("MGH") in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium ("NEALS") clinical trial network. The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is a large-scale collaborative effort made possible by contributions from patients and families, clinical trial sites, industry partners and research collaborators to evaluate multiple investigational therapies simultaneously with the goal of accelerating the development of potential new treatments for ALS. Therapeutic candidates that enter the platform trial are chosen by a group of expert ALS scientists and members of the Healey & AMG Center.
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Final data from the 28-day double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the Phase 1b study in mid 2023.
•Initiation of Phase 2/3 study in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial in mid 2023.
Other Programs
SAR443122/DNL758 RIPK1 Inhibitor Program for Peripheral Inflammatory Diseases
As part of our parallel development strategy, we have also developed a number of other structurally diverse CNS-penetrant and peripherally-restricted RIPK1 inhibitor molecules, which are included as part of the collaboration agreement with Sanofi, described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below. Sanofi is conducting two Phase 2 studies of the peripherally-restricted RIPK1 inhibitor SAR443122/DNL758 (eclitasertib), one in patients with CLE and the other in patients with UC. Sanofi is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of peripherally restricted RIPK1 inhibitors.
2023 expected progress and milestones:
•Primary completion of Phase 2 CLE study in June 2023.
•Continued recruitment of participants with UC in the Phase 2 study.
Licenses and Collaborations
Biogen License and Collaboration Agreement and Right of First Negotiation, Option and License Agreement
Overview
In August 2020, we entered into a binding Provisional Collaboration and License Agreement (“Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement”) with Biogen Inc.’s subsidiaries, Biogen MA Inc. (“BIMA”) and Biogen International GmbH (“BIG”) (BIMA and BIG, collectively, “Biogen”) pursuant to which we granted Biogen a license to co-develop and co-commercialize our small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor program (the “LRRK2 Program”), an option to our amyloid beta program utilizing our TV technology platform to cross the BBB as well as one other unnamed program also utilizing our TV technology platform (the “Option Programs”), and a right of first negotiation ("ROFN") with respect to two additional unnamed programs for indications within Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, ALS and MS utilizing our TV technology platform (the “ROFN Programs”), should we decide to seek a collaboration with a third party for such programs. In October 2020, we entered into a Definitive LRRK2 Collaboration and License Agreement (“LRRK2 Agreement”) and a Right of First Negotiation, Option and License Agreement (the “ROFN and Option Agreement”) with Biogen (collectively the "Biogen Collaboration Agreement"). The material terms of the LRRK2 Agreement and the ROFN and Option Agreement were consistent with, and superseded, the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement.
LRRK2 Agreement
The LRRK2 Agreement includes our small molecule LRRK2 inhibitors (“LRRK2 Products”) that penetrate the BBB, including DNL201 and BIIB122/DNL151, as well as those that do not penetrate the BBB. Based on the totality of preclinical and clinical data to date, both DNL201 and BIIB122/DNL151 (two chemically distinct LRRK2 inhibitors) have met our requirements to proceed into further late-stage clinical testing, however, BIIB122/DNL151 has been selected to proceed due to pharmacokinetic properties that provide additional dosing regimen flexibility.
Payments
Under the terms of the LRRK2 Agreement, Biogen paid us a $400.0 million upfront payment in October 2020. With respect to the LRRK2 Program, Biogen is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $1.125 billion upon achievement of certain development and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $375.0 million in development, $375.0 million upon first commercial sale, and $375.0 million in net sales-based milestones. We will share profits and losses equally with Biogen for LRRK2 Products in the United States and will share profits and losses in China with Biogen sharing 60% of such profits and losses and us sharing 40% of such profits and losses. We will be entitled to receive royalties in the high teens to low twenties percentages on net sales for LRRK2 Products outside of the United States and China. Information on cost sharing reimbursements between us and Biogen is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in our financial statements and the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
License Grant to LRRK2 Program
Under the LRRK2 Agreement, we granted Biogen a co-exclusive, worldwide license under intellectual property that we control related to our LRRK2 inhibitors, including certain intellectual property licensed to us by a third party.
Development and Commercialization of LRRK2 Program
We and Biogen are jointly developing LRRK2 Products pursuant to a clinical development plan set forth within the LRRK2 Agreement. We and Biogen share responsibility and costs for global development of LRRK2 Products pursuant to a mutually agreed development plan and budget ("LRRK2 Development Activities"), with Biogen funding 60% of such costs and us funding 40% of such costs. We have the ability to opt out of the development cost sharing arrangement, as further described below.
Biogen will lead commercialization activities globally for LRRK2 Products. We will co-commercialize the LRRK2 Products with Biogen in the United States and China, provided that the profit-sharing arrangement for the LRRK2 Products is still in effect, as further described below.
We may opt out of development cost sharing worldwide and upon such election, from any further profit-sharing from the LRRK2 Program. We also have the right to opt out of the profit-sharing arrangement for the LRRK2 Program or for only those LRRK2 Products that do not penetrate the BBB (“Peripheral LRRK2 Products”), in each of the United States and China. After such an opt out, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for, or be entitled to share in the applicable revenues from, such LRRK2 Program (or from the Peripheral LRRK2 Products) for such country, as applicable. If we choose to exercise our opt out rights, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable LRRK2 Program in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates for the applicable LRRK2 Program will be a percentage in the high teens to low twenties, but may increase to the low twenties to mid-twenties, if we have met certain co-funding thresholds or there has been a first commercial sale at the time of our election.
LRRK2 Program Manufacturing
Biogen will be responsible for delivering all supplies for clinical trials and commercial production for LRRK2 Products, except that we will deliver such supplies until the point of transition which will be mutually agreed by us and Biogen, but in no event later than commencement of activities to support commercial launch, and in any event we retain manufacturing rights for certain independent clinical activities. 
LRRK2 Program Royalty Term
For any LRRK2 Product for which Biogen is required to pay royalties, Biogen will pay us royalties on a country-by-country basis and product-by-product basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that product in the applicable country, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that product in the applicable country. If, in a particular country, a LRRK2 Product for which Biogen is required to pay royalties is not covered by specified patent rights in that country or where generic competition exists, Biogen’s royalty obligations in the applicable country would be reduced.
Exclusivity of LRRK2 Program
During the term of the LRRK2 Agreement, neither we nor Biogen may conduct preclinical, clinical or commercial activities involving any small molecule that targets LRRK2 as its primary mechanism of action anywhere in the world, unless such molecule is included under the collaboration and only to the extent such activity is permitted under the LRRK2 Agreement or, with respect to Biogen, the molecule is an ASO product that is the subject of a collaboration between Biogen and a particular third party.
Termination
Each party may terminate the LRRK2 Agreement in its entirety, if the other party remains in material breach of the LRRK2 Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach. After giving a specified amount of prior notice to us, Biogen may terminate the LRRK2 Agreement for convenience in its entirety, or with respect to one or more specified regions of the world. We may terminate the LRRK2 Agreement if Biogen fails to conduct meaningful activities to advance the development or commercialization of any LRRK2 Products for a specified period of time, unless Biogen cures such failure within a certain period of time or if Biogen challenges any patents licensed to it under the LRRK2 Agreement. We and Biogen may each terminate the LRRK2 Agreement in its entirety if the other party is declared insolvent or in similar financial distress.
Following any termination of the LRRK2 Agreement with respect to a particular region (or regions) of the world or termination of the LRRK2 Agreement in its entirety, our rights to each of our LRRK2 inhibitors that were licensed to Biogen will revert to us. Biogen will conduct certain development, manufacturing and commercialization activities on a transitional basis following termination of the LRRK2 Agreement, as outlined in the LRRK2 Agreement.
If the LRRK2 Agreement is terminated, Biogen will grant us an exclusive license to certain intellectual property controlled by Biogen with respect to such LRRK2 inhibitors.
ROFN and Option Agreement
Option Programs
In addition to the LRRK2 Program, Biogen also received an exclusive option to license two preclinical programs enabled by our TV technology platform, including our ATV:Abeta program and a second program utilizing our TV technology for an undisclosed target, excluding small molecules, AAVs and oligonucleotides (each, an "Option Program"). Biogen’s option may be triggered up to initiation of IND-enabling studies for each program and continues for each program until a specified period of time after delivery of an option data package or 30 business days after the 5th anniversary of the effective date of the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement, whichever is earlier.
ROFN Programs
Further, Biogen will have the right of first negotiation on two additional TV-enabled therapeutics within the fields of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, ALS and MS should we decide to seek a collaboration with a third party for such programs, but this does not include any of our small molecule, AAVs or oligonucleotide programs. The ROFN period continues until seven years after the effective date of the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement or the date on which we have offered Biogen two ROFN Programs and for which Biogen has agreed to trigger a ROFN for such program, whichever is earlier. However, if we do not execute an agreement with a third party with respect to a particular ROFN Program offered to Biogen within a specified amount of time, then Biogen will have one additional right to exercise the ROFN again with respect to such ROFN Program.
Payments
Under the ROFN and Option Agreement, Biogen paid us a $160.0 million upfront payment in October 2020. With respect to the options granted by us to Biogen, if exercised, Biogen is obligated to pay to us an aggregate of up to $270.0 million in option exercise and development milestone payments and an aggregate of up to $325.0 million upon first commercial sale, and up to $290.0 million of net sales-based milestone payments, following the achievement of certain prespecified milestone events and if Biogen exercises both of its options. Furthermore, Biogen is obligated to pay us royalties in the mid-single digit to mid-teens percentages, depending on the program for which Biogen exercises its option and upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds.
In addition, if Biogen exercises its ROFN with respect to an eligible Denali program, the parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith for a specified period of time regarding the financial and other terms of an agreement pursuant to which Biogen would obtain rights to such program.
License Grant to Option Programs
If Biogen exercises its option with respect to an Option Program, then we will grant Biogen an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property that we control that is specific to that Option Program, and a non-exclusive license under certain intellectual property that we control that pertains to our TV platform, in each case to develop, manufacture and commercialize products that are the subject of such Option Program.
Exclusivity of ROFN and Option Agreement
If the applicable option is exercised by Biogen, then until termination or expiration of the ROFN and Option Agreement, neither party may conduct preclinical, clinical or commercial activities involving certain therapeutic products directed to the same target, unless the therapeutic is included under the collaboration and only to the extent such activity is permitted under the ROFN and Option Agreement or the therapeutic is a product that includes AAVs, oligonucleotides or small molecules.
Termination
Each party may terminate the ROFN and Option Agreement in its entirety, if the other party remains in material breach of the ROFN and Option Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach. After giving a specified amount of prior notice to us, Biogen may terminate the ROFN and Option Agreement for convenience in its entirety or with respect to any Option Program for one or more specified regions or in its entirety. We may terminate the ROFN and Option Agreement if Biogen challenges any patents licensed to it under the ROFN and Option Agreement. We and Biogen may each terminate the ROFN and Option Agreement in its entirety if the other party is declared insolvent or in similar financial distress. 
Following any termination of the ROFN and Option Agreement in its entirety or with respect to an Option Program (including with respect to a region), the licenses that we granted to Biogen with respect to each such terminated Option Program will be terminated. Biogen will conduct certain development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for certain of such products on a transitional basis following termination of the ROFN and Option Agreement, as outlined in the ROFN and Option Agreement.
If the ROFN and Option Agreement is terminated following exercise of the applicable option with respect to an Option Program, Biogen will grant us an exclusive license to certain intellectual property controlled by Biogen with respect to certain of such products that were the subject of such Option Program.
Common Stock Purchase Agreement
In August 2020, in connection with the Provisional Biogen Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with BIMA, pursuant to which we sold 13,310,243 shares of our common stock to BIMA for an aggregate purchase price of $465.0 million in September 2020. In connection with the sale of shares, we entered into a standstill and stock restriction agreement (the “Standstill Agreement”) with Biogen, pursuant to which Biogen agreed to certain transfer and standstill restrictions, which have now expired, with the exception of certain volume limitations. Biogen remains entitled to certain demand registration rights for the shares received in the transaction under the terms of the Standstill Agreement. 
Sanofi Collaboration and License Agreement
Overview 
In October 2018, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Genzyme Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A. ("Sanofi") pursuant to which certain small molecule compounds that bind to and inhibit RIPK1 (“RIPK1 Inhibitors”) contributed by Sanofi and by us will be developed and commercialized. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018 when the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 were satisfied.
We and Sanofi are jointly developing products containing RIPK1 Inhibitors for neurological indications, such as Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and MS, and Sanofi is developing products containing RIPK1 Inhibitors for systemic inflammatory indications, such as CLE and UC.
The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement includes our and Sanofi’s RIPK1 Inhibitors that measurably penetrate the BBB ("CNS Products"), and our and Sanofi’s RIPK1 Inhibitors that do not measurably penetrate the BBB ("Peripheral Products"). The two most advanced RIPK1 Inhibitors in the collaboration 
are SAR443820/DNL788 and SAR443122/DNL758. SAR3443820/DNL788 is a CNS Product that was discovered by us and licensed to Sanofi who has completed Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers, and is leading two distinct Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with ALS and MS. SAR443122/DNL758 is a Peripheral Product discovered by us, and licensed to Sanofi who is leading two distinct Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with CLE and UC. 
License Grant 
Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide license under intellectual property that we control related to our RIPK1 Inhibitors, including certain intellectual property licensed to us by an academic institution.
Payments
When the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018, Sanofi paid us $125.0 million upfront. Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $215.0 million in clinical milestone payments and $385.0 million in regulatory milestone payments for CNS Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and in Japan for three indications, including Alzheimer's disease. Sanofi has made milestone payments of $40.0 million for CNS clinical milestones through December 31, 2022, with an additional $25.0 million earned and received in January 2023 upon commencement of dosing in the Phase 2 study of SAR443820/ DNL788 in patients with MS. The cumulative earned and potential milestones include $120.0 million in clinical milestone payments, $175.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and $200.0 million in commercial milestone payments for Peripheral Products, as defined, that are developed and approved in the United States, by the EMA and in Japan for three indications. Sanofi has made milestone payments of $35.0 million for peripheral clinical milestones through December 31, 2022.
We will share profits and losses equally with Sanofi for CNS Products sold in the United States and China, and receive variable royalties on net sales for CNS Products sold outside of the United States and China and for Peripheral Products sold worldwide, each as further described below. 
RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and developed and commercialized under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement will be subject to lower milestone and royalty payments to us compared to RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by us. We will also retain responsibility for certain payment obligations under our agreement with an academic institution which licensed certain intellectual property to us that we are sublicensing to Sanofi under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Program for Development and Commercialization of CNS Products 
We and Sanofi jointly develop CNS Products pursuant to a global development plan ("CNS Development Plan"). We will be responsible, at our cost, for conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products for Alzheimer’s disease and any activities required to support such clinical trials and specific for Alzheimer’s disease. Sanofi is responsible, at its cost, for all other Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products, including for ALS and MS. Sanofi will lead the conduct of all Phase 3 and later stage development trials for CNS Products, with Sanofi and us funding 70% and 30% of such costs, respectively. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement contains certain protections for us with respect to Phase 3 development costs not included in the initial budget for the CNS Development Plan agreed by the parties, including a deferral mechanism for costs incurred above the budgeted amounts for such trials and for costs incurred in respect of Phase 3 and other clinical trials not contemplated in the initial CNS Development Plan. In addition, we have the ability to opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as further described below.
Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for CNS Products. We may elect to conduct certain co-commercialization activities outside of MS with respect to each CNS Product in the United States and/or China, provided that the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for the relevant CNS Product are still in effect, as further described below.
We may opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for CNS Products in the United States and China on a CNS product-by-CNS Product and country-by-country basis. Sanofi may also terminate our cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if, following notice from Sanofi and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost-sharing obligations. After such an opt out by us or termination by Sanofi, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the applicable CNS Products and we will not share in the applicable profits from such CNS Products. Instead, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable CNS Products in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates will be a percentage in the low double digits to mid-teens, but may increase to the mid-teens to low-twenties percentages for all countries in which Sanofi is paying royalties on the applicable CNS Products, if we have met certain co-funding thresholds at the time of our election or Sanofi’s termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations.
Program for Development and Commercialization of Peripheral Products 
Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for conducting activities relating to the development and commercialization of all Peripheral Products. Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for Peripheral Products. We will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid- teen percentages on net sales of Peripheral Products. 
Manufacturing 
Sanofi will be responsible for delivering all supplies for current and future clinical trials and commercial production for CNS Products and Peripheral Products. However, we retain manufacturing rights for certain independent clinical activities.
Royalty Term 
For any CNS Product with respect to any country for which Sanofi is required to pay royalties on net sales and for each Peripheral Product, Sanofi will pay royalties to us on a country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that product in the applicable country, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that product in the applicable country. If, in a particular country, a CNS Product for which Sanofi is required to pay royalties or a Peripheral Product is not covered by specified patent rights in that country or net sales in that country decrease below specified thresholds as a result of generic competition, Sanofi’s royalty obligations in the applicable country would be reduced or would terminate as specified in the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Exclusivity 
During the term of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, neither we nor Sanofi may conduct IND-enabling, clinical or commercial activities involving any RIPK1 Inhibitor, anywhere in the world, unless the RIPK1 Inhibitor is included by us or Sanofi, as the case may be, under the collaboration and only to the extent such activity is permitted under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Termination 
Each party may terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, or with respect to a particular program (i.e., the CNS Products program or Peripheral Products program), as applicable, if the other party remains in material breach of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach. After giving a specified amount of prior notice to us, Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for convenience in its entirety, with respect to any particular program, or with respect to one or more specified regions of the world. Sanofi may also terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with respect to any program or a particular RIPK1 Inhibitor if a material safety event has occurred and cessation of all development and commercialization of all RIPK1 Inhibitors in the affected program or the affected RIPK1 Inhibitor is recommended. We and Sanofi may each terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the other party is declared insolvent or in similar financial distress or if, subject to a specified cure period, the other party challenges any patents licensed to it under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.
Following any termination of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with respect to a particular program or a particular region (or regions) of the world or termination of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, our rights to each of our RIPK1 Inhibitors that were licensed to Sanofi will revert to us. Sanofi will conduct certain development, manufacturing and commercialization activities on a transitional basis following termination of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as outlined in the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement or agreed by Sanofi, depending upon the basis for the applicable termination.
If the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by Sanofi for our material uncured breach, our insolvency or our challenge to any of the patents licensed to us by Sanofi, Sanofi will grant us an exclusive license to certain intellectual property controlled by Sanofi with respect to such RIPK1 Inhibitors (which could be subject to low single digit royalties payable to Sanofi).
Takeda Option and Collaboration Agreement
Overview
In January 2018, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement ("Takeda Collaboration Agreement") with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda"), pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option with respect to our ATV:BACE1/Tau, ATV:TREM2 and PTV:PGRN programs. Takeda paid us a $40.0 million upfront payment related to the collaboration, and an additional $110.0 million under a share purchase agreement in February 2018. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018, following satisfaction of certain requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. In February 2019, we amended the agreement to replace the ATV:BACE1/Tau program with the ATV:Tau program and in March 2022, the parties mutually agreed to terminate activity on the ATV:Tau program over which Takeda had its option to develop and commercialize jointly with the Company. Takeda exercised the options for the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 programs in November 2021 and December 2021, respectively.
Research Phase and Takeda’s Option
Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement we were responsible, at our cost, for conducting activities relating to pre-IND development of biologic products directed to the identified targets and enabled by our BBB delivery technology targeting TfR during the applicable option period. The option period continued for each target until the first biologic product candidate directed to the relevant target was IND-ready or about five years after selection of the target, whichever was earlier.
Takeda was obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $25.0 million with respect to each of the programs under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement directed to a target and based upon the achievement of certain preclinical milestone events, up to $55.0 million in total after the ATV:Tau program termination, all of which was received by December 31, 2022.
Collaboration Activities Following Takeda’s Option Exercise
Subsequent to Takeda exercising its option with respect to a particular target and collaboration program (i.e., the biologic products directed to the target for which Takeda has exercised its option), Takeda has the right to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, a specified number of biologic products enabled by our BBB technology that were developed during the option period and which are directed to the relevant target, and we are obligated to grant to Takeda a co-exclusive license under the intellectual property we control related to those biologic products.
Takeda was obligated to pay us a $5.0 million option fee for each target for which Takeda exercised its option, and we received fees totaling $10.0 million from Takeda in 2021 for option exercise payments for the PTV:PGRN and ATV:TREM2 programs. 
Since Takeda exercised its option for both collaboration programs, Takeda may be obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $280.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical milestone events and up to an aggregate of $200.0 million in regulatory milestone events relating to receipt of regulatory approval in the United States, certain European countries and Japan. Further, Takeda may also be obligated to pay us up to $75.0 million per biologic product upon achievement of a certain sales-based milestone, or an aggregate of $150.0 million if one biologic product from each program achieves the milestone.
Further, we and Takeda share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, the profits, for each collaboration program. However, for each collaboration program, we may elect not to continue sharing development and commercialization costs, or Takeda may elect to terminate our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations if, following notice from Takeda and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost sharing obligations with respect to the relevant collaboration program. After such an election by us or termination by Takeda becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the relevant collaboration program, and we will not share in any profits from that collaboration program. Instead we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties. The royalty rates will be in the low- to mid-teen percentages on net sales, or low- to high-teen percentages on net sales if we have met a certain co-funding threshold at the time of our election to opt out of co-development or Takeda’s termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations, and, in each case, these royalty rates will be subject to certain reductions specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Takeda will pay these royalties to us for each biologic product included in the relevant collaboration program, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant biologic product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that biologic product, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that biologic product in the applicable country, unless biosimilar competition in excess of a significant level specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement occurs earlier, in which case Takeda’s royalty obligations in the applicable country would terminate.
For each collaboration program for which we are sharing costs and profits with Takeda, we will lead the conduct of clinical activities for each indication up to the first trial with a clinical outcomes-based efficacy endpoint, and Takeda will lead the conduct of all subsequent clinical activities for that indication. For each collaboration program for which we are sharing costs and profits with Takeda, we and Takeda will jointly commercialize biologic products included in the relevant collaboration program in the United States and China. Unless we have opted out of cost-sharing for both collaboration programs, we have the right to lead commercialization activities in the United States for one collaboration program and Takeda will lead commercialization activities in the United States for all collaboration programs for which we do not lead commercialization activities. Further, Takeda will lead commercialization activities in China and will solely conduct commercialization activities in all other countries.
We have the right to lead all manufacturing activities for all collaboration programs for which the parties are sharing costs and profits.
Information on cost sharing reimbursements between us and Takeda is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in our financial statements and the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Exclusivity
Unless the Takeda Collaboration Agreement is terminated earlier, until expiration of an agreed period of time after the first regulatory approval in the United States or Europe of a biologic product within the applicable collaboration program, neither party may conduct clinical or commercial activities involving antibodies or protein-based therapeutic products directed to the same target (or in the case of a bi-specific program, the same combination of targets) that have an intended therapeutic effect in diseases and conditions of the CNS (including LSDs), except to the extent permitted under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
Termination
Each party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, or with respect to a particular collaboration program, as applicable, if the other party remains in material breach of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach. Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any particular collaboration program, for convenience and after giving a specified amount of prior notice to us. Takeda may also terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to any collaboration program if the joint steering committee established under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement unanimously agrees that a material safety event has occurred with respect to the applicable collaboration program. We may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to a particular collaboration program if Takeda fails to conduct material development and commercial activities for a specified period of time with respect to a collaboration program, unless Takeda cures such failure within a certain period of time. We and Takeda may each terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the other party is declared insolvent or in similar financial distress or if, subject to a specified cure period, the other party challenges any patents licensed to it under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
Following any termination of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to a particular collaboration program or the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, our rights to each terminated collaboration program will revert to us, Takeda will grant us a license to intellectual property owned by Takeda with respect to such collaboration program (which could be subject to certain royalty payments that would be negotiated at the time of such a termination) and, unless the termination was by Takeda on the basis of a material safety event, Takeda will conduct certain development, manufacturing and commercialization wind-down activities.
Common Stock Purchase Agreement
Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Takeda in January 2018, pursuant to which we sold 4,214,559 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”) to Takeda for an aggregate purchase price of $110.0 million. We closed the sale to Takeda in February 2018.
At closing, we also entered into a standstill and stock restriction agreement (the “Standstill Agreement”) with Takeda. Pursuant to the terms of the Standstill Agreement, Takeda agreed to certain transfer and standstill restrictions for a specified period of time following the closing of the sale, which have now expired. Takeda remains entitled to certain demand registration rights with respect to the Shares following termination of the transfer restrictions if the Shares cannot be resold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
F-star License and Collaboration Agreement
Overview
In August 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (“F-star Collaboration Agreement”) with F-star Gamma Limited (“F-star Gamma”), F-star Biotechnologische Forschungs-und Entwicklungsges m.b.H ("F-star GmbH") and F-star Biotechnology Limited ("F-star Ltd") (collectively "F-star"). The goal of the collaboration was the development of certain constant Fc domains of an antibody with non-native antigen binding activity, or Fcabs, to enhance delivery of therapeutics across the BBB into the brain. The collaboration was designed to leverage F-star’s modular antibody technology and our expertise in the development of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In connection with the entry into the F-star collaboration agreement, we also purchased an option for an upfront option fee of $0.5 million, which we refer to as the buy-out-option, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma pursuant to a pre-negotiated buy-out option agreement (the “Option Agreement”). 
In May 2018, we exercised such buy-out option and entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the shareholders of F-star Gamma and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma (the “Acquisition”). 
As a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and we changed the entity’s name to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, we became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Ltd (by way of the Company’s assumption of F-star Gamma’s license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016, (the “F-star Gamma License”)). We made initial exercise payments under the Purchase Agreement and the F-star Gamma License of $18.0 million in the aggregate, less the net liabilities of F-star Gamma, which were approximately $0.2 million. In addition, we are required to make contingent payments, to F-star Ltd and the former shareholders of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount following completion of the research phase of the F-star collaboration of $243.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. These include up to $3.0 million in preclinical contingent payments, $30.0 million in clinical contingent payments, $60.0 million in regulatory contingent payments and $150.0 million in commercial contingent payments. In June 2019, we made a payment of $1.5 million to F-star Ltd upon the achievement of a specified preclinical milestone in the Company's ETV:IDS program. 
Under the terms of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, we could nominate up to three Fcab targets (“Accepted Fcab Targets”) within the first three years of the date of the F-star Collaboration Agreement. Upon entering into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we had selected TfR as the first Accepted Fcab Target and paid F-star Gamma an upfront fee of $5.5 million, which included selection of the first Accepted Fcab Target. In May 2018, we exercised our right to nominate two additional Fcab Targets and identified CD98 as the second Accepted Fcab Target. We made a one-time payment for the two additional Accepted Fcab Targets of, in the aggregate, $6.0 million and extended the time period for our selection of the third Accepted Fcab Target until approximately the fourth anniversary of the date of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement. We did not identify a third Fcab Target. We were also responsible for certain research costs incurred by F-star Ltd in conducting activities under an agreed development plan for each Fcab, for up to 24 months after the target Fcab is accepted. In July 2021, we executed a side letter to our agreements with F-star which confirmed the completion of the research services performed by F-star Ltd that were funded by us. 
Genentech Exclusive License Agreement
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”). The agreement gives us access to Genentech’s LRRK2 inhibitor small molecule program for Parkinson’s disease. Under the agreement, Genentech granted us (i) an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under Genentech’s rights to certain patents and patent applications directed to small molecule compounds which bind to and inhibit LRRK2 and (ii) a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain related know-how, in each case, to develop and commercialize certain compounds and licensed products incorporating any such compound. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts during the first three years of the agreement to research, develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. 
Our financial obligations upon entering the agreement with Genentech included an upfront payment of $8.5 million and a technology transfer fee of $1.5 million. In addition, we may owe Genentech milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, up to a maximum of $315.0 million in the aggregate. These milestones include up to $37.5 million in clinical milestone payments, $102.5 million in regulatory milestone payments and $175.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid Genentech $12.5 million in milestone payments triggered upon the achievement of specified clinical milestone events in the company's LRRK2 program being developed in collaboration with Biogen, with milestones totaling $15.0 million earned through December 31, 2022.
In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages, with the exact royalty rate dependent on various factors, including (i) whether the compound incorporated in the relevant licensed product is a Genentech-provided compound or a compound acquired or developed by us, (ii) the date a compound was first discovered, derived or optimized by us, (iii) the existence of patent rights covering the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, (iv) the existence of orphan drug exclusivity covering a licensed product that is a Genentech-provided compound and (v) the level of annual net sales of the relevant licensed product. We also have the right to credit a certain amount of third-party royalty and milestone payments against royalty and milestone payments owed to Genentech, but such credit cannot reduce our royalty obligation to Genentech by more than fifty percent. Our royalty payment obligations will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (a) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country or (b) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country. If one of our licensed products incorporates a compound provided to us by Genentech, has orphan drug exclusivity, and is not covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent, we must pay royalties on net sales of such licensed products on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until such orphan drug exclusivity in such country expires, but our obligation to pay these royalties may be eliminated or reduced if there is a clinically superior product marketed in such country. Under the terms of our LRRK2 Agreement with Biogen, Biogen is responsible for 50% of any payment obligation to Genentech under this agreement accruing after October 2020.
Unless earlier terminated, our agreement with Genentech will continue in effect until all of our royalty and milestone payment obligations to Genentech expire. Following expiration of the agreement, we will retain our licenses under the intellectual property Genentech licensed to us on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis. Genentech may terminate the agreement if we challenge any of the patent rights licensed to us by Genentech, or if we materially breach the agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or enter into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If Genentech terminates the agreement for our material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency after we have made a milestone payment to Genentech, then we are obligated to grant to Genentech an exclusive right of first negotiation with respect to certain of our patents, know-how and regulatory filings directed to Genentech-provided compounds. We do not have the right to terminate the agreement without cause, but may terminate the agreement for Genentech’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions. 
Manufacturing
We believe it is important to our business success to have a reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply chain. As we mature as a company and approach commercial stage operations, securing reliable high-quality commercial drug supply will be critical.
We currently rely on third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations ("CDMOs"), to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials used during the development of our product candidates. We have established relationships with several CDMOs, including Lonza Sales AG ("Lonza") and WuXi Biologics Limited ("Wuxi"). Effective September 2017, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, which we have subsequently amended to add scope of work. We refer to this agreement, as amended, as the DMSA or the Lonza agreement. Pursuant to the Lonza agreement, Lonza agreed to provide clinical development and manufacturing services with respect to certain of our biologic products on a fee-for-service basis. 
We do not currently operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. In August 2021 we entered into, and subsequently amended, a lease for a clinical manufacturing site in Salt Lake City, Utah. We plan to use the facility to expand our clinical manufacturing capabilities for biologic therapeutics including the manufacture of materials for toxicology studies and drug substance for early human clinical studies, with the goal of increasing flexibility and speed in advancing new investigational therapies into clinical trials. The build-out of the Utah site is in process, and we currently expect to gain access to the facility in 2023 and begin manufacturing in 2024.
We currently do not need commercial manufacturing capacity. When and if this becomes relevant, we intend to evaluate both third-party manufacturers as well as building out internal capabilities and capacity. 
Commercialization Plan
We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities at the current time. 
Our vision, however, is to become a fully integrated, independent global leader in neurodegeneration with capabilities spanning discovery, development, manufacturing and commercial in order to optimize speed, quality and level of patient access to our medicines. We look to grow strategically both in terms of therapeutic areas of high unmet need, starting with lysosomal storage diseases with CNS pathology and expanding into large neurodegenerative disorders, as well as from a geographic perspective, with an initial focus on establishing a commercial presence in the United States and the European Union ("EU"), with subsequent global expansion (including China).
For programs covered by collaboration agreements (including those with Takeda, Sanofi and Biogen), we expect to commercialize only in certain geographies, as defined by the terms of the agreements with the counterpart, and rely on our partners to provide commercialization infrastructure for the rest of the world. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the neurodegenerative disease field, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
Our product candidates will compete with current therapies approved for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, which to date have been primarily targeted at treating the symptoms of such diseases rather than halting or slowing the progression of the disease. However, in addition to such currently approved therapies, we believe that our product candidates, if approved, may also compete with other potential therapies intended to halt or slow the progression of neurodegenerative disease that are being developed by a number of companies and institutions, including but not limited to:
•Alzheimer’s Disease: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Biogen, Eli Lilly (including Prevail Therapeutics, its wholly owned subsidiary), Eisai, Roche (including Genentech, its wholly owned subsidiary), Alector and Abbvie in various stages of development.
•Parkinson’s Disease: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Prothena, Roche (including Genentech, its wholly owned subsidiary), Novartis/UCB, Biogen, Ionis, Eli Lilly (including Prevail Therapeutics, its wholly owned subsidiary), AstraZeneca, Takeda, Oncodesign/Servier and Neuron 23 in various stages of development.
•ALS: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Biogen, Ionis, Amylyx (FDA & Health Canada approval of Relyvrio/Albrioza), AB Science, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Calico/Abbvie in various stages of development.
•FTD-GRN: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alector/GSK, Eli Lilly (including Prevail Therapeutics, its wholly owned subsidiary), Passage Bio, Arkuda Therapeutics, Biomarin, Orchard Therapeutics in various stages of development.
•Lysosomal Storage Diseases: The currently approved treatments for LSDs are enzyme-based therapies. Various BBB-penetrant and direct to CNS delivered ERTs and gene therapies are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including JCR Pharmaceuticals, RegenxBio, Homology Medicines, Orchard Therapeutics, Takeda and Ultragenyx in various stages of development.
In addition, there are companies that are developing technologies that would compete directly with our technologies, including:
•Blood-Brain Barrier Technology: There are several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing BBB delivery technologies that utilize RMT, including Abbvie, biOasis Technologies, ABL Bio, BioArtic, JCR Pharmaceuticals and Roche (including Genentech, its wholly owned subsidiary), among others.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries and BBB platform technology, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of December 31, 2022, our owned and licensed patent portfolio includes over 1,400 patents and patent applications, including over 30 licensed U.S. issued patents and 20 owned U.S. issued patents, covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology, our product candidates, and related inventions and improvements. The patent portfolio also includes over 450 licensed patents issued in jurisdictions outside of the United States, and over 800 owned patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. For our product candidates and our BBB platform technology, we generally pursue or in-license patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use, and manufacture. 
BBB Platform
We own ten patent families related to our BBB platform technology. These include a family directed to the composition and sequences of our TfR-binding TVs, which, if issued are expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. We also have two issued U.S. patents, which are also expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, as well as pending patent applications, to other BBB platform technology. Other families related to BBB platform technology, if issued, are expected to expire in 2038 or later, all not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. In addition, we license multiple patent families from F-star, the earliest issued patents of which are expected to expire in 2026, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
ETV Platform, ETV:IDS, and ETV: SGSH Programs
We own seven patent families directed to our ETV platform and related products, including ETV:IDS and ETV: SGSH. This includes an issued U.S. patent, which is expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, directed to the composition of matter of our ETV:IDS molecules, including DNL310. We also own five additional patent families directed to various aspects of our DNL310 program, which if issued, are expected to expire in 2039 or later, all not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Of the seven patent families, two families relate to the composition of matter of our ETV:SGSH structures, including DNL126. Any patents issuing from these families are expected to expire in 2038 and 2041, respectively, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
PTV:PGRN Program
We own four patent families directed to our PTV:PGRN program. These include two families directed to the composition of matter of our PTV:PGRN structures, including TAK-594/DNL593, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039 and 2040, respectively, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. We also own additional patent families directed to various aspects of our TAK-594/DNL593 program, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039 or later, all not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Our PTV:PGRN program is subject to our Takeda collaboration.
ATV:TREM2 Program
We own five patent families related to our ATV:TREM2 program. These families include a granted U.S. patent, which is expected to expire in 2041, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, directed to the composition of matter of our ATV:TREM2 molecules, including TAK-920/DNL919. The other four patent families, if issued, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2040, all not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Our ATV:TREM2 program is subject to our Takeda collaboration.
Oligonucleotide Transport Vehicle Platform
We own two patent families related to our OTV platform. These families are directed to compositions and methods of use of our OTVs, and if issued, are expected to expire in 2042 and 2043, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
LRRK2 Inhibitor Program
Our LRRK2 program is subject to our collaboration agreement with Biogen. For this program, we license multiple patent families from Genentech directed to, among other things, DNL201, BIIB122/DNL151 and other related compounds, which are expected to expire in 2031, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Furthermore, we own additional patent families that have projected expiration dates in 2038 or later, not accounting for any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, related to the LRRK2 program. We also own a patent family that includes three issued U.S. patents, which are expected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, directed to the composition of matter of BIIB122/DNL151 and methods of treatment using BIIB122/DNL151, respectively, as well as pending patent applications and granted patents in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
RIPK1 Inhibitor Program
Our RIPK1 program is subject to our collaboration agreement with Sanofi. We own five patent families directed to our RIPK1 inhibitor program. These include a family with one issued U.S. patent, directed to the composition of matter of our current RIPK1 lead, SAR443820/DNL788, which is expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. We also own a patent family that includes two issued U.S. patents, which are expected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, and pending patent applications, which are directed to the composition of matter of SAR443122/DNL758 as well as other RIPK1 inhibitor compounds.
eIF2b Activator Program
We own seven patent families directed to our eIF2B activator program, including two patent families directed to DNL343 that are expected to expire in 2038 or later, with the remaining families directed to other eIF2B compounds expiring between 2038 and 2040, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
We cannot guarantee that our owned and licensed pending patent applications, or any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the scope of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our programs and product candidates. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") to determine priority of invention. For more information, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a new drug application ("NDA"), or a biologics license application ("BLA"), process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice ("GLP"), requirements;
•Submission of an IND to the FDA, which must become effective before human interventional clinical trials may begin;
•Approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•Submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
•A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
•Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMP"), requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•Potential FDA inspection of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and
•Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials that precludes study initiation and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Interventional clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.

•Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, and initial side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
•Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and Parkinson's disease information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.

•Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Expedited written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs, and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate or severity of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, the FDA has issued guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including certain reporting requirements, and additional guidance on the good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection and other topics. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations are unclear. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, directly or indirectly through impacts on our contractors and suppliers, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.
We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued guidance, which the FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic. In 2021 and 2022, the FDA published a number of industry guidance documents, including updates to previous guidance, related to Good Manufacturing Practices, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.
NDA/BLA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for the specified indication(s) and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use and/or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators or cooperative clinical groups. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s FY 2023 user fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2023, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is $3,242,026. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug or biologic of $393,933. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs for an orphan indication submission. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing, such as the issuance of a Refuse to File (RTF) letter. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease, and not to all uses or indications within the entire disease or condition. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to facilitate an efficient drug development program. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track or breakthrough therapy designation program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. 
Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. Priority review reduces the review time for an initial or supplemental marketing application by four months.
A product may be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality ("IMM"), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval subsequently provide additional data confirming the anticipated clinical benefit, for example by performing adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If clinical benefit is not confirmed, accelerated approval may be revoked. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"), Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:
•analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and
•animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity).
In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:

•the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
•the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;

•the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
•the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
•the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
•the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
•for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product.
The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an “orphan drug”) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians in the United States may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, an applicant would be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or a supplement before any material modifications can be implemented for a drug or biologic, including changes in labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, which may require the development of additional data or nonclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
•applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA"), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
European Union Drug Development
As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority ("NCA"), and one or more ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014, which went into effect on January 31, 2022, will ensure that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. 
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization ("MA"). There are two types of marketing authorizations.
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure may also apply for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State ("RMS"). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics ("SPC"), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Starting in January 2021, the MHRA assumed additional regulatory responsibilities for medical products marketed in the UK, as pan-EU regulatory procedures before the EMA no longer apply in the UK. MHRA and the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control ("NIBSC") recently issued new guidance documents to the industry regarding regulation under the UK system. Proposals set forth in the new MHRA guidance will take effect through legislative changes that are subject to parliamentary approval, which may increase the amount of resources and time needed for obtaining regulatory approval in the UK and delay our clinical development and commercialization. On January 1, 2024, MHRA plans to launch a new streamlined international recognition framework, which will replace the current European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP) and allow the MHRA to rely on or give regard to a European decision or decision of other regulators to grant a new marketing authorization for a product. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price ("AMP"), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (e.g., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA"), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. 
There have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
At the state level, legislatures have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States indicates continued pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Financial Information about Segments
We manage our operations as a single reportable segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. See "Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 427 full-time employees. A large majority of our employees work out of our headquarters location in South San Francisco, CA, with the remainder working out of our locations in Salt Lake City, Utah and Zurich, Switzerland. 
Our human capital strategy aims to attract new talent and retain and incentivize existing employees by investing in their professional development, as well as providing them with challenging and rewarding opportunities for personal growth. Our working environment is guided by the core Denali values of trust, growth, grit and unity, and reinforced by developing quality leadership, fostering diversity and inclusion, emphasizing continuous growth, creating opportunities for engagement, and embracing our goal to defeat degeneration. Our values-driven culture is complemented by our incentive plans, which serve to (1) attract and retain employees through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards; and (2) motivate employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives, thereby increasing the value and success of our company. 
Key areas of focus for Denali include:
Health and Safety. Our health and safety programs are designed around global standards with specifications addressing regulations, specific hazards, and the unique working environment of our operations. We mandate employee health and safety training and ergonomic assessments, and require specialized training for all lab-based employees. We conduct regular internal safety audits to ensure that proper safety policies and program procedures are in place. In addition, we engage both internal and third-party compliance assessments and audit selected operations for adherence to health and safety standards. Denali’s safety programs have been highly effective: since we commenced operations in 2015, we have had zero reportable regulatory safety incidents.
Diversity and Inclusion. Denali embraces differences and acknowledges the valuable perspectives that a diverse workforce brings to problem-solving. Our Unity in Diversity team spearheads action-oriented diversity programs, such as social responsibility through community leadership and volunteerism, investment in STEM-focused outreach, and creating a safe place for expression and ideas. As part of our plan to create a more inclusive workplace, we have adopted a zero tolerance policy towards harassment and discrimination and created safe avenues for employees to submit complaints, including an anonymous hotline and a formal complaint system that allows for direct access to our Human Resources Department.
We have implemented several measures to ensure that we are accountable for making progress on our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Diversity and inclusion objectives are embedded in our annual performance goals. We also ensure pipeline diversity by partnering with each division in their workforce planning forecasts to develop initiatives and goals to recruit diverse talent across all leadership and skill areas. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 53% of our workforce and 51% of managers were female. As of December 31, 2022, ethnic or racial minorities represented approximately 53% of our workforce and 47% of our managers.
Training and Development. We believe training and development are an important part of creating a safe, productive, fair, and equal environment. We encourage continuous feedback, improvement, and growth for our employees. We provide technical, leadership and compliance training to all employees in several formats, including through live seminars, online trainings and professional organizations. Managers are given annual training to hone their supervisory skills and better support their employees’ development; they are, in turn, accountable for guiding the development of a personal and professional growth plan for each employee. In addition, Denali has designed employee development programs to help employees develop essential skills that are aligned to promote growth and Denali’s values. 
Flexible Work Options. The global pandemic has accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. Denali values workplace flexibility and hybrid ways of working, and has introduced a policy which we believe balances more workplace flexibility with time together to collaborate and connect in person. We use enhanced tools and technology designed to help us optimize productivity and collaboration while facilitating a hybrid work environment for our diverse workforce.
