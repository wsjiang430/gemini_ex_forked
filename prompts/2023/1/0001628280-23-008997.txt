Item 1. Business.
FS Energy and Power Fund, or the Company, which may also be referred to as "we," "us" or "our," was organized in September 2010 and commenced investment operations in July 2011. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of approximately $2.6 billion.
We are managed by FS/EIG Advisor, LLC, or FS/EIG Advisor, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, pursuant to an investment advisory and administrative services agreement dated as of April 9, 2018, as amended, or the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. FS/EIG Advisor oversees the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio. 
Our investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of energy and power, or Energy, companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days’ prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change. We consider Energy companies to be those companies that engage in the exploration, development, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storage, refining, distribution, mining, generation or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined products, coal or power, including those companies that provide equipment or services to companies engaged in any of the foregoing. We seek to concentrate our investments on debt securities in Energy companies that we believe have, or are connected to, a strong infrastructure and/or underlying asset base so as to enhance collateral coverage and downside protection for our investments. We may also make select equity investments in certain Energy companies meeting our investment objectives of current income generation and long-term capital appreciation. Our primary areas of focus will be the upstream, midstream, power and service and equipment sub-sectors of the Energy industry; however, we broadly define our ‘‘Energy Investment Universe’’ as follows:
•Upstream—businesses that find, develop and extract energy resources, including natural gas, crude oil and coal, from onshore and offshore reservoirs; 
•Midstream—businesses that gather, process, store and transmit energy resources and their by-products, including businesses that own pipelines, gathering systems, gas processing plants, liquefied natural gas facilities and other energy infrastructure;
•Downstream—businesses that refine, market and distribute refined energy resources, such as customer-ready natural gas, propane and gasoline, to end-user customers; 
•Power—businesses engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of power and electricity or in the production of alternative energy; and
•Service and Equipment—businesses that provide services and/or equipment to aid in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including seismic, drilling, completion and production activities, as well as those companies that support the operations and development of power assets.
Our investment objectives are to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet our investment objectives by:
•utilizing the experience and expertise of FS/EIG Advisor in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions; 
•employing a conservative investment approach focused on current income and long-term investment performance; 
•focusing primarily on debt or debt-like investments, such as structured preferred equity investments, in a broad array of private Energy companies within the United States; 
•making select equity investments in certain Energy companies that have strong growth potential; 
•investing primarily in established, stable enterprises with positive cash flow and strong asset and collateral coverage so as to limit the risk of potential principal loss; and 
•maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative events within our portfolio.
The majority of our portfolio is comprised of income-oriented securities, which principally refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. Generally, we 
expect to invest primarily in directly originated investments and primary market transactions, as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project’s or company’s needs with our investment objectives. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior secured debt and directly originated preferred equity investments, which we believe offer opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. These yield enhancements are typically expected to include royalty interests in mineral, oil and gas properties, warrants, options, net profits interests, cash flow participations or other forms of equity participation that can provide additional consideration or “upside” in a transaction. Our preferred equity investments are mostly directly originated and may take the form of perpetual or redeemable securities, typically with a current income component and minimum base returns. In addition, certain income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships, or MLPs. MLPs are entities that (i) are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies, (ii) are publicly traded, (iii) satisfy certain requirements to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (iv) primarily own and operate midstream and upstream Energy companies. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructurings of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including total return swaps, credit default swaps and other commodity swap contracts. FS/EIG Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or other more opportunistic investments. We expect that the size of our individual investments will generally range between $10 million and $250 million each, although investments may vary proportionately as amounts available for investment change and the size of our capital base changes and will ultimately be at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, subject to oversight by our board of trustees.
To seek to enhance our returns, we intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. With certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts or issue debt securities if our asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% immediately after such borrowing. The minimum asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act, however, is currently 150% provided that certain disclosure and approval requirements are met.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. In an order dated June 4, 2013, or the Order, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of its former investment adviser, including FS KKR Capital Corp., or collectively our co-investment affiliates. Effective April 9, 2018, or the JV Effective Date, and in connection with the transition of advisory services to a joint advisory relationship with EIG, our board of trustees authorized and directed that we (i) withdraw from the Order, except with respect to any transaction in which we participated in reliance on the Order prior to the JV Effective Date, and (ii) rely on an exemptive relief order dated April 10, 2018, granted to EIG and its affiliates which permits us to participate in co-investment transactions with certain other EIG advised funds, or the EIG Order. 
While a BDC may list its shares for trading in the public markets, we have currently elected not to do so. Prior to any liquidity event, a non-traded structure allows us to operate with a long-term view, instead of managing to quarterly market expectations. We and FS/EIG Advisor will continue to evaluate the appropriate form and timing of any liquidity event, taking into account, among other things, the composition of our portfolio and market conditions.
For information regarding our share repurchase program, distributions and our distribution reinvestment plan, including certain related tax considerations, see “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Share Repurchase Program, De Minimus Account Liquidation and Distributions” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—RIC Status and Distributions.”

Potential Market Opportunity
FS/EIG Advisor believes that global energy and energy-related infrastructure markets are in a period of dynamic change and that fundamental shifts in global supply and demand have created, and will continue to create, investment opportunities across the entire Energy value chain.
Characteristics of and Risks Related to Investments in Private Companies
The majority of our portfolio is comprised of income-oriented securities of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. Investments in private companies pose significantly greater risks than investments in public companies. First, private companies have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress. As a result, these companies, which may present greater credit risk than public companies, may be unable to meet the obligations under their debt and equity securities that we hold. Second, the investments themselves may often be illiquid. The securities of many of the companies in which we invest are not publicly traded or actively traded on the secondary market and are, instead, traded on a privately negotiated over-the-counter secondary market for institutional investors. In addition, our directly originated investments generally will not be traded on any secondary market, and a trading market for such investments may not develop. These securities may also be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale. As such, we may have difficulty exiting an investment promptly or at a desired price prior to maturity or outside of a normal amortization schedule. These investments may also be difficult to value because little public information generally exists about private companies, requiring an experienced due diligence team to analyze and value the potential portfolio company. Finally, these companies may not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of FS/EIG Advisor or EIG to obtain adequate information through their due diligence efforts to evaluate the creditworthiness of, and risks involved in investing in, these companies, and to determine the optimal time to exit an investment. These companies and their financial information will also generally not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other rules and regulations that govern public companies that are designed to protect investors.
Investment Strategy
Our investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in securities of Energy companies. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days’ prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change. In accordance with the best interests of our shareholders, FS/EIG Advisor monitors our targeted investment mix as economic conditions evolve.
When identifying prospective portfolio companies, we focus primarily on the attributes set forth below, which we believe help us generate higher total returns with an acceptable level of risk. While these criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions, we caution investors that, if we believe the benefits of investing are sufficiently strong, not all of these criteria necessarily will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. These attributes are:
◦Deeply-rooted asset value. We seek to invest in companies that have significant asset value rather than speculative investments that rely solely on rising energy commodity prices, exploratory drilling success or factors beyond the control of a portfolio company. We focus on companies that have strong potential for enhancing asset value through factors within their control, such as operating cost reductions and revenue increases driven by improved operations of previously under-performing or under-exploited assets. We expect such investments to have significant collateral coverage and downside protection irrespective of the broader economy.
◦Defensible market positions.  We seek to invest in companies that have developed strong positions within their sector and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service our investments in a range of economic environments. We seek companies that can protect their competitive advantages through scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality versus their competitors, thereby minimizing business risk and protecting profitability.
◦Proven management teams. We focus on companies that have experienced management teams with an established track record of success. We typically require our portfolio companies to have proper incentives in place, which may include non-cash and performance-based compensation, to align management’s goals with ours.
◦Commodity price management. We seek to invest in companies that appropriately manage their commodity price exposure through the use of hedging arrangements and other contracts and instruments that seek to minimize the company’s exposure to significant commodity price volatility.
◦Allocation among various issuers and sub-sectors.  We seek to allocate our portfolio broadly among issuers and certain sectors within the Energy industry, thereby attempting to reduce the risk of a downturn in any one company or sector having a disproportionate adverse impact on the value of our portfolio.
In addition, since the JV Effective Date, the EIG Order has permitted us to participate in co-investment transactions with certain other EIG advised funds. We believe that the ability to participate in co-investment transactions with other funds managed by EIG permits us to participate in a broader range of, and allocate a higher percentage of our portfolio to, secured, directly negotiated investments that span the upstream, midstream, power and service and equipment sectors.
Joint Venture
Since January 2020, we have also invested with Imperial Sustainable Infrastructure Investments, LLC, or Imperial, a subsidiary of Imperial Capital Asset Management, LLC, through Sustainable Infrastructure Investments, LLC, or SIIJV, a joint venture between us and Imperial. SIIJV invests its capital in senior secured loans (both first lien and second lien) to middle market companies, broadly syndicated loans and other midstream, renewables and power assets. We and Imperial each have 50% voting control of SIIJV and together are required to agree on all investment decisions as well as all other significant actions for SIIJV. As of December 31, 2022, SIIJV had total capital commitments of up to $67,629 in U.S. dollars and $5,430 in Canadian dollars pursuant to which we and Imperial have agreed to provide 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the committed capital. As of December 31, 2022, we and Imperial funded approximately $62,300 to SIIJV, of which $54,514 was from us. As of December 31, 2022, our investment in SIIJV had a fair market value of approximately $51,098. We do not consolidate SIIJV in our consolidated financial statements. 
Potential Competitive Strengths
We believe that we offer investors the following potential competitive strengths:
Global Platform with Seasoned Investment Professionals.
We believe that the breadth and depth of the experience of FS/EIG Advisor’s management team, which is dedicated to sourcing, structuring, executing, monitoring and harvesting a broad range of private investments, provides us with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing and analyzing what we believe to be attractive investment opportunities. 
Long-term Investment Horizon.
Our long-term investment horizon gives us great flexibility for pursuing transactions, which we believe allows us to maximize returns on our investments. Unlike private equity and venture capital funds, we are not required to return capital to our shareholders once we exit a portfolio investment. Such funds typically can only be invested once and capital must be returned to 
investors after a specific time period. These provisions often force private equity and venture capital funds to seek liquidity events, including initial public offerings, mergers or recapitalizations, more quickly than they otherwise might, potentially resulting in a lower return to investors. We believe that freedom from such capital return requirements, which allows us to invest using a longer term focus, provides us with the opportunity to increase total returns on invested capital, compared to other private company investment vehicles.
Disciplined, Income-Oriented Investment Philosophy.
FS/EIG Advisor employs an investment approach focused on current income and long-term investment performance. This investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity, as well as ongoing monitoring of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of deteriorating credit conditions at portfolio companies which would result in adverse portfolio developments. This strategy is designed to maximize current income and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining the potential for long-term capital appreciation.
Investment Expertise Across All Levels of the Corporate Capital Structure.
FS/EIG Advisor believes that its broad expertise and experience investing at all levels of a company’s capital structure enable us to manage risk while affording us the opportunity for positive returns on our investments. We attempt to capitalize on this expertise in an effort to produce and maintain an investment portfolio that will perform in a broad range of economic conditions. In addition, we seek to leverage this broad-ranging capability to enable us to provide Energy companies with financing that most closely aligns with their particular capital needs. We believe that such flexibility is valuable to Energy companies and provides us with an advantage over other capital providers that are more limited in the securities in which they invest.
Energy Specialists with In-House Technical Expertise.
The energy industry expertise and experience of the investment personnel of FS/EIG Advisor continue to represent a competitive advantage for us relative to other Energy company capital providers. We believe it is important to have experience investing throughout multiple business and commodity cycles and maintain extensive technical capabilities due to the complexities in the underlying businesses. Focusing on providing capital to Energy projects and companies since 1982, EIG has employed investment professionals and engineers with significant industry experience and maintains one of the longest continuous track records of any institutional investor in the industry. FS/EIG Advisor leverages this experience as it makes investment decisions. We further believe that we are a desirable partner for Energy companies because we have specialized knowledge of the economic, regulatory, and stakeholder considerations faced by them.
Investment Sourcing Capabilities.
We believe that the experience, technical expertise, depth and continuity of FS/EIG Advisor’s team are key differentiators for us relative to our competitors. We believe that FS/EIG Advisor’s substantial in-house technical expertise and recognized brand name in the Energy industry provide a competitive advantage in sourcing, analyzing and executing Energy, resource and related infrastructure projects, as FS/EIG Advisor is typically able to make independent evaluations of investment opportunities without significant reliance on third-party consultants.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
Our investment activities are managed by FS/EIG Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FS/EIG Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. See Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of the fees we pay to FS/EIG Advisor.
FS/EIG Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.
Pursuant to the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, we reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor’s allocable portion of the compensation and/or related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and EIG providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor, and for 
transactional expenses for prospective investments, such as fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of investments that do not close, often referred to as "broken deal" costs. We reimburse FS/EIG Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor’s actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as time allocations and other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees compares the total amount paid to FS/EIG Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor.
In addition, we have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company, or State Street, to provide various accounting and administrative services including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS/EIG Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance.
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt will be limited in certain significant respects pursuant to the 1940 Act. Within the limits of existing regulation, we will adjust our use of debt, according to market conditions, to the level we believe will allow us to generate maximum risk-adjusted returns. See "—Regulation." We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
Investment Types
The majority of our portfolio is comprised of income-oriented securities, which principally refers to debt securities and income-oriented preferred and common equity interests, of privately-held Energy companies within the United States. Generally, we expect to invest primarily in directly originated investments and primary market transactions, as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project’s or company’s needs with our investment objectives. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior secured debt and directly originated preferred equity investments, which we believe offer opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. These yield enhancements are typically expected to include royalty interests in mineral, oil and gas properties, warrants, options, net profits interests, cash flow participations or other forms of equity participation that can provide additional consideration or “upside” in a transaction. Our preferred equity investments are mostly directly originated and may take the form of perpetual or redeemable securities, typically with a current income component and minimum base returns. In addition, certain income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in MLPs. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructurings of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including total return swaps, credit default swaps and other commodity swap contracts. FS/EIG Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. 
Historically, we have focused on the following investment categories: (i) direct originations and (ii) broadly syndicated investments. Going forward, FS/EIG Advisor intends to continue to rebalance our portfolio from syndicated investments into mostly directly originated investments.
Senior secured debt
Senior secured debt is situated at the top of the capital structure. Because this debt has priority in payment, it typically carries the lowest risk among all investments in a company. Generally, senior secured debt in which we invest is expected to have a maturity period of three to seven years, offer some form of amortization, and have first priority security interests in the assets of the borrower. Senior secured debt may also include second lien debt, which is granted a second priority security interest in the assets of the borrower, meaning that any realization of collateral will generally be applied to pay first lien debt in full before second lien debt positions are paid, and the value of the collateral may not be enough to repay in full both first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt. Generally, we expect that the variable interest rate on our first lien debt will typically range between 4.0% and 9.0% over a standard benchmark, such as the prime rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. We expect that the variable interest rate on second lien debt will range between 6.0% and 12.0% over a standard 
benchmark. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any yield enhancements we receive in connection with these investments.
Unsecured debt
In addition to senior secured debt, we may invest a portion of our assets in unsecured debt. Unsecured debt is effectively subordinated to first lien and second lien secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt, but is senior to preferred equity and common equity in the capital structure. In return for its junior status compared to first lien and second lien secured debt, unsecured debt typically offers higher returns through both higher interest rates and possible equity ownership in the form of warrants or other yield enhancements, enabling the investor to participate in the capital appreciation of the borrower. Where warrants are received, they typically require only a nominal cost to exercise. We intend to generally target unsecured debt with interest-only payments throughout the life of the security, with the principal due at maturity. Typically, unsecured debt investments have maturities of five to ten years. In normalized markets, we expect these securities to carry a fixed rate or a floating current yield of 4.0% to 10.0% over a standard benchmark. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants or other yield enhancements we receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid-in-kind, or PIK.
Preferred equity
Preferred equity typically includes a stated value or liquidation preference that is contractually senior to common equity, and may include a dividend or yield feature. Holders of preferred equity can be entitled to a wide range of voting and other rights, depending on the structure of each security. Preferred equity can also include a conversion feature whereby the securities convert into common stock based on established parameters according to set ratios. We seek to invest in primarily income-oriented equity securities of Energy companies in a manner consistent with our status as a BDC. Going forward, FS/EIG Advisor intends to focus on preferred equity securities that are directly originated.
Other equity securities
We may also invest in other equity securities which are typically subordinated to all other securities within the capital structure and do not have a stated maturity. As compared to more senior securities, equity interests have greater risk exposure, but also have the potential to provide a higher return.
Net profits interests, royalty interests, volumetric production payments, or VPPs
We may invest in energy-specific non-operating investments including net profits interests, royalty interests or VPPs. Such non-operating interests do not include the rights and obligations of operating a mineral property (costs of exploration, development and operation) and do not bear any part of the net losses. Net profits interests and royalty interests are contractual agreements whereby the holders of such interests are entitled to a portion of the mineral production or proceeds therefrom. A VPP is a type of structured investment whereby the owner sells a specific volume of production in a field or property to an investor and the investor receives a specific quota of production on a monthly basis in either raw output or proceeds therefrom. A VPP is typically set to expire after a certain length of time or after a specified aggregate total volume of the commodity has been delivered. If the producer cannot meet the supply quota for a given period, the supply obligation rolls forward to future cycles until the buyer is made financially whole.
Non-U.S. securities
We may invest in non-U.S. securities, including securities of companies in emerging markets, which may include securities denominated in U.S. dollars or in non-U.S. currencies, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. In addition, investing in securities of companies in emerging markets involves many risks, including potential inflationary economic environments, regulation by foreign governments, different accounting standards, political uncertainties and economic, social, political, financial, tax and security conditions in the applicable emerging market, any of which could negatively affect the value of companies in emerging markets or investments in their securities.
Investments with Third-Parties
We may co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, thereby acquiring jointly-controlled or non-controlling interests in certain investments in conjunction with participation by one or more third parties in such investment.
Derivatives
We may also invest from time to time in derivatives, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and other commodity swap contracts. We anticipate that any use of derivatives would primarily be as a substitute for investing in conventional securities. Any use of derivatives may subject us to additional risks. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments—We may from time 
to time enter into total return swaps, credit default swaps, fixed price swaps or other derivative transactions which expose us to certain risks, including credit risk, market risk, commodity risk, liquidity risk and other risks similar to those associated with the use of leverage.”
Cash and cash equivalents
We may maintain a certain level of cash or equivalent instruments to make follow-on investments, if necessary, in existing portfolio companies or to take advantage of new opportunities or existing commitments.
Sources of Income
The primary means through which our shareholders may receive a return of value is through interest income, dividends and capital gains generated by our investments. In addition to these sources of income, we may receive fees paid by our portfolio companies, including one-time closing fees paid at the time each investment is made. FS/EIG Advisor has agreed to offset the amount of any structuring, upfront or certain other fees received by FS/EIG Advisor or its members against the management fees payable by us under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. Closing fees typically range from 1.0% to 2.0% of the purchase price of an investment. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees.
Risk Management
We seek to limit the downside potential of our investment portfolio by, among other things:
•applying our investment strategy guidelines for portfolio investments;
•requiring a total return on investments (including both interest and potential appreciation) that adequately compensates us for credit risk;
•allocating our portfolio among various issuers and sub-sectors, size permitting, with an adequate number of companies, across different sub-sectors of the Energy industry, with different types of collateral; and
•negotiating or seeking debt and other securities with covenants or features that protect us while affording portfolio companies flexibility in managing their businesses consistent with preservation of capital, which may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights.
We may also enter into interest rate hedging transactions. Such transactions will enable us to selectively modify interest rate exposure as market conditions dictate.
Affirmative Covenants
Affirmative covenants require borrowers to take actions that are meant to ensure the solvency of the company, facilitate the lender's monitoring of the borrower and ensure payment of interest and loan principal due to lenders. Examples of affirmative covenants include covenants requiring the borrower to maintain adequate insurance, accounting and tax records, and to produce frequent financial reports for the benefit of the lender.
Negative Covenants
Negative covenants impose restrictions on the borrower and are meant to protect lenders from actions that the borrower may take that could harm the credit quality of the lender's investments. Examples of negative covenants include restrictions on the payment of dividends and restrictions on the issuance of additional debt without the lender's approval. In addition, certain covenants restrict a borrower's activities by requiring it to meet certain earnings interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio requirements. These covenants are also referred to as financial or maintenance covenants.
Investment Process
The investment professionals supporting FS/EIG Advisor have spent their careers developing the experience necessary to invest in private companies. Our current transaction process is highlighted below. 
Our Transaction Process
Screening
The relationships of FS/EIG Advisor and its affiliates provide us with access to a robust and established pipeline of investment opportunities from a variety of different investment channels, including private equity sponsors, non-sponsored corporates, 
financial advisors, banks, brokers and family offices. In addition, personnel of FS/EIG Advisor have long-standing personal contacts within the Energy industry who provide us with additional opportunities for directly originated investments. Similarly, substantial in-house technical expertise and recognized brand name in the Energy industry of FS/EIG Advisor and its affiliates provide a competitive advantage in sourcing, analyzing and executing energy, resource and related infrastructure projects, as FS/EIG Advisor is typically able to make independent evaluations of investment opportunities without significant reliance on third-party consultants. Once a potential investment has been identified, FS/EIG Advisor screens the opportunity and makes a preliminary determination concerning whether to proceed with a more comprehensive deal-level due diligence review.
Due diligence
Our due diligence process will typically involve: (i) evaluation of the proposed investment consistent with our investment criteria; (ii) meetings with project sponsors and management; (iii) a review of technical feasibility; (iv) a preliminary review of key project contracts; and (v) an analysis of fundamental project economics.
Structure iterations and feedback
If a potential investment passes the initial review process, the investment team then negotiates preliminary terms with the potential portfolio company. We seek to maintain flexibility in structuring the form of investments and utilize this flexibility to provide tailor-made financing solutions.
Recommendation and approval process
At an advanced stage of the due diligence process, the deal team will prepare a draft investment recommendation, which is circulated internally for peer review, a process that allows select investment professionals of FS/EIG Advisor and its affiliates who are not directly involved in the transaction to review independently the merits of the investment. A final investment recommendation is submitted to the FS/EIG Advisor investment committee for review and approval. Each investment must be approved by the FS/EIG Advisor investment committee.
Execution
Once the FS/EIG Advisor investment committee has determined that the portfolio company is suitable for investment, FS/EIG Advisor works with the management team of the prospective company to finalize the structure and terms of the investment. We believe that structuring transactions appropriately is a key factor to producing strong investment results. Accordingly, we will actively consider transaction structures and seek to process and negotiate terms that provide the best opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns.
Post-investment monitoring
Portfolio monitoring. FS/EIG Advisor monitors our portfolio with a focus toward anticipating negative credit events. To maintain portfolio company performance and help to ensure a successful exit, FS/EIG Advisor works closely with the lead equity sponsor, loan syndicator, portfolio company management, consultants, advisers and other security holders to discuss financial position, compliance with covenants, financial requirements and execution of the company’s business plan. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the transaction, we may occupy a seat or serve as an observer on a portfolio company’s board of directors or similar governing body. We believe that close contact with management, efficient flow of information and ongoing analysis form the basis of the monitoring process.
Typically, FS/EIG Advisor receives financial reports that may detail information such as operating performance, sales volumes, margins, cash flows, financial position and other key operating metrics on a quarterly basis from our portfolio companies. FS/EIG Advisor uses this data, combined with due diligence gained through contact with the company’s customers, suppliers, competitors, market research and other methods, to conduct an ongoing, rigorous assessment of the company’s operating performance and prospects.
In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FS/EIG Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FS/EIG Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio Asset Quality” for a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating.
Valuation Process. Our board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to FS/EIG Advisor’s valuation policy. As permitted by Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, our board of trustees has designated FS/EIG Advisor as our valuation designee with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio 
valuation process set forth in FS/EIG Advisor’s valuation policy. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Valuation of Portfolio Investments.”
Managerial Assistance. As a BDC, we must offer, and provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Depending on the nature of the assistance required, FS/EIG Advisor will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than FS/EIG Advisor, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.
Financing Arrangements
To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, but in no event may leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our financing arrangements.
Regulation
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our trustees be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities,” which the 1940 Act defines as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.
We will generally not be able to issue and sell our common shares at a price per share, after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts, that is below our net asset value per share. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Business Development Companies—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and a RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.” We may seek the approval of our shareholders to issue shares of our common shares at a price below the then current net asset value per share for a twelve month period following shareholder approval. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common shares at a price below net asset value per share in rights offerings to existing shareholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. The EIG Order permits us to co-invest in privately negotiated investment transactions with private funds managed by EIG or its affiliates.
During 2022, compliance with material governmental regulation applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
1.Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
a.is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
b.is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
c.satisfies any of the following: 
i.does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 
ii.has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; 
iii.is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 
iv.is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million. 
2.Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control. 
3.Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
4.Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
5.Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
6.Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its trustees, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests (as defined below) in order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described below under "—Taxation as a RIC." Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. FS/EIG Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of shares senior to our common shares if our asset coverage, as applicable to us under the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Debt Financing" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Business Development Companies."
Code of Ethics
We and FS/EIG Advisor have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 promulgated under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 of the Advisers Act, respectively, that, among other things, establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with each code's pre-clearance and other requirements. Each code of ethics is available on our website at www.fsinvestments.com and on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at www.sec.gov. Shareholders may also obtain a copy of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC's Public Reference Section, at 100 F Street, N.E, Washington, D.C. 20549.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and FS/EIG Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our chief compliance officer and the chief compliance officer of FS/EIG Advisor are responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to FS/EIG Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of FS/EIG Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by FS/EIG Advisor and our non-interested trustees, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, FS/EIG Advisor has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of FS/EIG Advisor are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 promulgated under, the Advisers Act.
Personnel of FS/EIG Advisor and its affiliates will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of its clients. Such personnel will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although FS/EIG Advisor will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients' portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
The proxy voting decisions are made by the senior personnel of FS/EIG Advisor and its affiliates who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients' investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how FS/EIG Advisor intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Shareholders may obtain information, without charge, regarding how FS/EIG Advisor voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, FS Energy and Power Fund, 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112 or by calling us collect at (215) 495-1150.
Other
We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any trustee or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office.
Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance
We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 promulgated under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act, our management will be required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
Taxation as a RIC
We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To qualify for and maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends of an amount at least equal to 90% of our "investment company taxable income," which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, or the Annual Distribution Requirement.
If we:
•qualify as a RIC; and 
•satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,
then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income or capital gains we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends to our shareholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) as dividends to our shareholders.
As a RIC, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute dividends in a timely manner to our shareholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (as adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) 100% of any net ordinary income and capital gain net income recognized for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We generally will endeavor in each tax year to avoid any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings.
We have previously incurred, and may incur in the future, such excise tax on a portion of our income and capital gains. While we intend to distribute income and capital gains to minimize exposure to the 4% excise tax, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we generally will be liable for the excise tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each tax year; 
•derive in each tax year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or foreign currencies, net income from certain "qualified publicly-traded partnerships (which generally are partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof), other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income)," or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or other securities, or the 90% Income Test; and 
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the tax year: 
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and 
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain "qualified publicly-traded partnerships," or the Diversification Tests.
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income. If our expenses in a given tax year exceed our investment company taxable income, we may experience a net operating loss for that tax year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent tax years and such net operating losses do not pass through to its shareholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, the excess of realized capital losses over realized capital gains) to offset its investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such net capital losses, and use them to offset future capital gains, indefinitely. Due to these limits on deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our shareholders even if such taxable income is greater than the net income we actually earn during those years.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each tax year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same tax year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.
We invest a portion of our net assets in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless instruments, how payments received on instruments in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt obligations in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We will address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income to avoid any material U.S. federal income or excise tax.
Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to maintain RIC tax treatment under Subchapter M of the Code. We may have to sell or otherwise dispose of some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. See "—Regulation—Senior Securities." Moreover, our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we sell or otherwise dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
To satisfy the Diversification Tests at the close of each quarter of our tax year, we will generally have invested no more than 25% of the value of our total assets in MLPs and certain other "qualified publicly traded partnerships". As a limited partner in the MLPs in which we seek to invest, we will be deemed to have received our share of income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits from those MLPs. Historically, a significant portion of income from MLPs has been offset by tax deductions. As a result, this income has been significantly lower than cash distributions paid by MLPs. The percentage of an MLP's income and gains which is offset by tax deductions, losses and credits will fluctuate over time for various reasons. A significant slowdown in acquisition activity or capital spending by MLPs held in our portfolio could result in a reduction of accelerated depreciation generated by new acquisitions, which may result in an increase in our investment company taxable income that we are required to distribute to shareholders to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or to eliminate our liability for U.S. federal income tax. If our income from our investments in MLPs exceeds the cash distributions received from such investments, we may need to obtain cash from other sources in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may also recognize for 
U.S. federal income tax purposes gain in excess of cash proceeds upon the sale of an interest in an MLP. Any such gain may need to be distributed (or deemed distributed) in order to avoid liability for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on such gain.
A portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulties that require us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such transaction could, depending upon the specific terms of the transaction, result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any such transaction could also result in our receiving assets that give rise to non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test or otherwise would not count toward satisfying the Diversification Tests.
Some of the income that we might otherwise earn, such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, may not satisfy the 90% Income Test. To manage the risk that such income might disqualify us as a RIC for failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, one or more subsidiary entities treated as U.S. corporations for entity-level tax purposes may be employed to earn such income and (if applicable) hold the related asset. Such subsidiary entities will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce the yield to our shareholders on such fees and income.
Competition
Our primary competitors for investments include other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds and CLO funds). In addition, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, have begun to invest in areas in which they have not traditionally invested, including making investments in middle market private U.S. companies. We also compete with traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks. We believe we will be able to compete with these entities for financing opportunities on the basis of, among other things, the experience of FS/EIG Advisor’s senior management team.
Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we have. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater experience operating under, or are not subject to, the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could delay deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses.”
Employees
We do not currently have any employees. Each of our executive officers is a principal, officer or employee of FS/EIG Advisor or its affiliates, which manages and oversees our investment operations. In the future, FS/EIG Advisor may retain additional investment personnel based upon its needs.
