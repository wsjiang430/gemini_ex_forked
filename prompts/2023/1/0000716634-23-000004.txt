BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Synergistic Diversification and Branding

We are an internationally diversified company focused on the development, ownership and operation of entertainment and real property assets in three jurisdictions: (i) United States (“U.S.”), (ii) Australia, and (iii) New Zealand. We group our businesses in two operating segments, which are owned and operated through various operating subsidiaries:
Theatrical Motion Picture Exhibition (“Cinema Exhibition”), through our 62 cinemas. 
Real Estate, including real estate development and the rental or licensing of retail, commercial and live theatre assets comprised, as of the date of this 2022 Annual Report, of approximately 9,926,000 square feet of land and approximately 728,000 square feet of net rentable area. 
COVID-19 Impact and Company Response

COVID-19 Impact on our Cinema Business

The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted not only the global economy, but the global cinema industry, including our Company. Our cinema segment, along with our live theaters, suffered a material adverse impact in 2020, 2021 and into 2022. In March 2020, as a result of the pandemic, all of our cinemas and live theatres in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand were forced to temporarily close by government mandate, ultimately causing an immediate halt to our cinema revenues and income. To address this liquidity challenge in 2020 and 2021, we monetized five non-core assets to create short term liquidity for our Company, we implemented various cash preservation strategies, including, but not limited to, laying off our hourly U.S. cinema and live theatre staff, postponing non-essential operating and capital expenditures, negotiating rent abatements/deferrals with third-party cinema landlords and other major suppliers. We also worked with our lenders to modify our financing arrangements to accommodate the economic condition of the business resulting from the pandemic. 

In 2021, a majority of our cinemas reopened (some with occupancy restrictions in place), but admissions continued to be down from pre-pandemic levels due to a weaker slate of movies from the major studios and distributors. As a result of both production backlogs and concerns about movie-goers desire to attend public events through the pandemic, major studios and distributors moved certain movies (i) to later release dates or (ii) directly to streaming, home video or premium video on demand (“PVOD”) platforms and thereby passing the exclusive theatrical release window. 

Further impacting our overall profitability was the impact the pandemic had on our cinema business’ operating expenses. Supply chain issues and the marked increase in inflation through this period resulted in higher operating expenses. Our venues also faced labor challenges, including hiring and retaining staff, in addition to mandated increasing wage rates.

As of the date of this 2022 Annual Report, all our cinemas are open other than our Courtenay Central in Wellington, New Zealand which is unlikely to reopen until the redevelopment of the property is completed. Despite being open for business and Hollywood’s COVID induced production backlog, 2022 resulted in significantly fewer wide releases than pre-COVID periods. Additionally, the 2022 box office was impacted by the direct or simultaneous release of movies to ancillary platforms rather than an exclusive theatrical run basis. A more robust slate of major movie releases is expected during 2023, which has generated optimism that box office revenues will continue to improve compared to the pandemic periods (2020-2022). Based on today’s 2023 movie release schedule, the number of titles available for theatrical release, and the anticipated appeal of many of those titles to a variety of audiences, should support increased attendance and box office grosses for 2023. Total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were $77.9 million, $139.1 million, and $203.1 million, respectively, compared to $276.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, the last pre-pandemic year. Finally, we believe that the major studios have reinforced a commitment to an exclusive theatrical window, as opposed to releasing their content either direct to or simultaneously with streaming, home video or PVOD platforms.

As a result of fallout from the pandemic, a number of U.S. exhibitors have filed for bankruptcy and/or have begun to shed underperforming cinemas. During 2022, we terminated our lease and permanently closed one U.S. cinema and have advised two additional U.S. landlords of our intention to end our leases and close those U.S. cinemas. 

Over the course of the pandemic, we have been able to negotiate certain lease concessions from some of our landlords. However, many of those concessions have been in the form of rent deferrals, and we are, in a number of situations, now carrying the added burden of paying down those deferrals, which puts additional stress on our cinema cash flows. As of the date of this 2022 Annual Report, our existing rent deferral obligation is $9.4 million. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a greater impact on us than some other U.S. based exhibitors. The U.S. Congress determined that, as a public company (despite our micro-cap status), we should be excluded from participation in various federal pandemic relief programs such as the Shuttered Venue Operator Grant Program and Payroll Protection Programs. Our liquidity position and recovery from the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic would have been significantly improved if we had been eligible for such U.S. federal pandemic relief. This has put us at a competitive disadvantage to private operators who were able to access such funding.


COVID-19 Impact on our Real Estate Business

Our real estate business has been less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of this 2022 Annual Report, virtually all of our third-party tenants in Australia are operating and paying full rent.  While New York City live theatre audiences have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, our two live theatres are both currently licensed. Following government mandated closures effective in March 2020, STOMP reopened at our Orpheum Theater in New York on July 20, 2021. However, STOMP closed on January 8, 2023 after an historic nearly 30 year run. We have entered into license agreement for a new production – The Empire Strips Back – which is scheduled to open at the Orpheum in April 2023. Audible, an Amazon company, continues to license our Minetta Lane Theatre in New York, and, following almost 18 months of government mandated closure resumed public performances on October 8, 2021. 

With regard to our architectural award winning 44 Union Square redevelopment project in New York City, while the COVID-19 pandemic and the current “work from home” focus of many employees severely constrained leasing activity in New York City, in January 2022 we did secure a long-term lease for the cellar, ground floor, and second floor of the building with an affiliate of Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: WOOF), a leading pet health and wellness company (“Petco”). Though our real estate team continues to work to secure one or more tenants for the remaining space at 44 Union Square, we believe that the pandemic’s impact on the office leasing market in New York City and the slower pace of the “return to office” effort in New York City have impacted and will continue to impact our efforts to locate an office tenant for the space at 44 Union Square. We have mortgage financing in place for this project to cover leasing and tenant improvement costs of such space. 

With respect to our office building in Culver City, we began receiving rental income from a new tenant in October 2020.

In general, the loss of cinema cash flow due to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to scale back our real estate development activities during the 2020-2022 period. 

Management’s Responses to the Challenges of COVID-19

To date, we have taken a number of significant steps to preserve our liquidity, and we will continue to evaluate our operations as the world more fully recovers from the pandemic in 2023. We have modified our business strategy in order to shore up our long-term viability in a way that would not have a dilutive impact on our stockholders, overleverage our Company, or require that we fire sale assets. In response to lower cash inflows from our cinema businesses, we reviewed our real estate portfolio to identify assets that had not been adversely impacted by the pandemic and which would require material capital investment to generate any material increase in value. These asset monetizations are detailed at Note 5 - Real Estate Transactions to the financial statements. In arriving at the determination to rely upon the monetization of certain non-core real estate assets to bridge this gap in cinema cashflow (which in 2021 

 -  -


 produced net proceeds to our Company of $139.4 million), we considered a variety of alternatives, including the issuance of additional common stock and the issuance of high interest rate “junk” debt. We determined that it would be in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders to avoid dilutive equity issuances and to avoid high interest rate debt. We have used the proceeds from the sale of these properties to pay down debt, to cover operating expenses, to fund limited capital improvements, and to strengthen our liquidity. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $29.9 million, compared to $83.3 million at December 31, 2021. During 2022, we have reduced our net bank debt from $236.9 million as of December 31, 2021, to $215.6 million as of December 31, 2022. 

As we continue to navigate the post-pandemic period and the challenging macro-economic environment marked by higher interest rates and costs of operations, we will continue to assess and reassess our real estate holdings as a funding resource. We continue to analyze and reanalyze each of our properties as a possible source of cash to fund operations and/or pay debt. In this process, we remain focused on identifying non-core assets unlikely to enjoy material value increases without substantial capital investment that can be monetized in a reasonable manner without material adverse tax consequences. 

In addition to the monetization of certain non-core real estate assets, we implemented a number of measures to reduce our day-to-day cost of operations while improving the safety of our cinemas in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures have included, but are not limited to, terminating U.S. cinema and live theater staff for the period of cinema closures, reducing our utilities and essential operating expenditures to the minimum levels necessary, terminating or deferring non-essential capital expenditure, and reducing corporate-level employment costs. We have enhanced our cleaning protocols and installed partitions and air filtration systems to improve the safety aspects of our cinemas and upgraded our mobile platforms to increase social distancing. Furthermore, we were able to keep our Australia and New Zealand cinema level staff due to government assistance provided in those countries. 

We were able to maintain most of our cinema assets and keep our key personnel in place as we reopened our cinemas. Generally speaking, our lenders and landlords continue to work with us. While we have closed or anticipate that we will close certain non-performing U.S. cinemas, and while we are in discussions with various landlords as to modifications in our occupancy arrangements, to date no landlord has terminated our right to occupy any of our cinemas. We have a variety of landlords, and these discussions are being progressed on a location-by-location basis. Further, we believe that our relationships with our film suppliers continue to be strong. 

While COVID-19 impacts seem to be on the decline globally, we continue to experience residual impacts that we anticipate will be passing in the long-term, and we believe that we will ultimately return to results that resemble those of the pre-pandemic era in the future. However, no assurance can be given that we will achieve these results and, unfortunately, there is still a risk of future global outbreaks of COVID-19 or other diseases. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by long-term social trends and movie release patterns, which are placing greater emphasis on streaming in periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In short, we have thus far preserved our core business and, while we have monetized on favorable terms certain real estate assets earlier than we had intended and may be called upon to further cull our portfolio, we still hold quality real estate assets in which to invest our time and resources.

 | United StatesAustralia | Several of our cinemas are arthouses or specialty theaters operating under our Angelika brand. These cinemas feature specialty films, such as independent films, international films, and documentaries. Since its opening in 1989, our New York City Angelika Film Center has been and consistently continues to be one of the most popular and influential arthouse cinemas in the U.S., featuring principally independent and foreign films. To date, we have expanded our Angelika Film Center Group to include nine other Angelika Film Centers: two in Dallas, TX, two in the Washington DC area, three in New York, NY, one in Sacramento, CA and one in San Diego, CA. Each of our Angelika Film Centers also offers a curated food and beverage experience. In early 2021, we announced that our Cinemas 1,2,3, Village East and Tower Theatre cinemas would be operated as Angelika brand cinemas: (i) the Cinemas 1,2,3 by Angelika, (ii) the Village East by Angelika and (iii) the Tower Theatre by Angelika. In December 2019, we acquired the iconic 100-year-old State Cinema in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, which has been ranked the fifth highest grossing arthouse in Australia for the last decade. The cinema, which features 10 screens, a rooftop cinema and bar, a large café and an independent bookstore, is and has been a major cultural destination in North Hobart for decades. In early 2021, the cinema was also rebranded as State Cinema by Angelika. The State Cinema Bar which serves a range of wines and spirits was rebranded the Angelika Bar in 2020. We continue to look to expand our specialty theater portfolio by looking for more specialty theater sites in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. We anticipate opening later this year in Brisbane our first “Angelika” Film Centre in Australia. | Angelika Film CenterState Cinema

 | | United StatesAustralia | Launched in December 2020, Angelika Anywhere, is an art focused streaming platform available in the U.S. and more recently, in Australia. We created Angelika Anywhere to allow us to expand the reach of our “Angelika” based cinema experience beyond the four walls of a conventional brick-and-mortar cinema. Our goal is to offer cinephiles easy and curated access to the type of product that has made our Angelika Film Center in NYC the most recognized, dedicated arthouse in North America. | Angelika Anywhere 
Real Estate / Leasing | | United States | Historically known as Tammany Hall, this approximately 70,000 square foot building overlooking Manhattan’s Union Square, has now signed its first tenant Petco Animal Supplies Stores. Inc (“Petco”) who will occupy most of the ground floor, the cellar and the second floor. Hailed as a dramatic pièce de résistance with its first in the city, over 800-piece, glass dome, this building brings the future to New York’s fabled past. In 2022, the building was selected for the following awards: (i) 2022 The American Architecture Award for Restoration and Renovation; (ii) 2022 ACEC NY Engineering Excellence Award; and (iii) 2022 Building/Technology Systems Diamond Award. 44 Union Square is one of a very limited number of locations in Manhattan that will provide major office tenant(s) with a “brandable” site, and the only such location on Union Square. This location now has an active lease with Petco leasing 42% of the leasable area, including the lower level, ground floor and second floor. | 44 Union Square 
 | | Australia | Located on 203,000 square feet of land in suburban Brisbane, Newmarket Village is currently comprised of approximately 143,828 square feet of net rentable area, including a Coles Supermarket and 47 other third-party tenants, offering community level F&B, retail, and professional services. At the end of 2017, we completed a major expansion that added a new eight-screen Reading Cinemas with TITAN LUXE, an additional 10,000 square feet of restaurant tenant space and 124 parking spaces. Adjacent to our Newmarket Village, we own a three-level, 22,000 square foot office building. Taken together with the retail components, the center is 98% leased as of December 31, 2022. | Newmarket Village

 | | New Zealand | Located in the heart of Wellington – New Zealand’s capital city – this center is comprised, on a consolidated basis through various subsidiaries, of 161,000 square feet of land, including two parking lot parcels totaling 84,184 square feet. Courtenay Central is situated proximate to the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum (attracting over 1.5 million visitors annually, pre-COVID), across the street from the site of the new convention center being constructed to handle the demand for such space in Wellington (estimated to open its doors in 2023) and at a major public transit hub. Damage from the 2016 earthquake necessitated demolition of our nine-story parking garage at the site. In January 2019, unrelated seismic issues caused us to close major portions of the existing cinema and retail structure while we move forward with plans to redevelop the center as an entertainment themed urban center with major food beverage components. Wellington continues to be rated as one of the top cities in the world in which to live, and we continue to believe that our assets in Wellington are located in one of the most vibrant areas of New Zealand. | Courtenay Central
Live Theatre | | United States | We operate two off-Broadway live theatres in Manhattan under the Liberty Theatres tradename. In 2018, we entered a license with Audible, a subsidiary of Amazon, pursuant to which our Minetta Lane Theatre serves as Audible’s live theatre home in New York City, which now runs through March 15, 2024. The long running show STOMP has ended its 30-year run at our Orpheum Theatre, and we have entered into a license agreement for a new show, The Empire Strips Back, scheduled to open in April 2023. | Liberty Theatres 





Our business plan is to coordinate cinema-based entertainment and real estate to create a powerful and mutually beneficial partnership. Our historically strong and consistent cash flows from our cinemas have, prior to the pandemic, enabled us to be strategic and proactive in acquiring and holding long-term real estate assets, including non-income producing land, and to fuel our real estate development endeavors. However, uncertainty as to current U.S. cinema cash flows has required that we constrain our activities on both the cinema side and the real estate side of or business.

Our real estate portfolio has historically provided us with a solid foundation and helped us weather the COVID caused storm. It has also, over the years, given us financial leverage providing us with a collateral base to support comparatively long term and stable real estate based borrowing. This dynamic combination of cinema and real estate has historically offered a host of advantages that we believe will continue to pay dividends as the longer term pandemic consequences abate. More specifically, the combination of these two segments can provide a variety of business advantages including the following:
Diversification of our Risk Profile and Enhanced Flexibility in meeting our Cash Needs. We believe that a solid real estate base provides flexibility to raise additional liquidity through one, or a combination of mortgage-based borrowing, sale and leaseback transactions and/or sale. Real-estate backed loans typically allow higher leverage of cash flows than operating loans secured by cinema assets, and the underlying assets themselves provide us a more ready source of liquidity through sale than traditional cinema assets. Strategic asset monetization has formed a key part of our COVID-19 response strategy.

Reduced Pressure to Deliver Cinema Business Growth; to Grow for Growth’s Sake. During pre-pandemic periods, our competitors bid up the price of independent circuits and cinema leases in order to grow their market share through re-investment of their cinema cash flow and leverage. While we investigated many of these opportunities, we could not justify the prices paid and the rents required. We have in recent periods focused our cash flow on upgrading our existing cinemas and developing our real estate assets, rather than chasing cinema deals. We have adopted a “better, not bigger” strategy with respect to our U.S. cinema circuit. In 2022, we allocated $6.3 million to upgrade and expand our cinema assets and $2.6 million for non-cinema real estate investments. The COVID-19 pandemic restrained our capital reinvestment. We believe, however, that maintaining a strategic approach to our investments and focusing on our core real estate activities will enable us to weather the challenges posed by the current economic climate and continue to grow our business in the long term. We will continuously monitor market conditions and adjust our investments as needed to ensure financial stability and continued success. It may be, as major exhibitors, such as Regal, walk away from cinema assets that opportunities will present themselves to expand our circuit with minimal capital expenditure and on sustainable lease terms.

Enhanced Control over our own Destiny. As a developer and operator of cinemas, we have enjoyed a unique advantage in creating large-scale retail developments such as our entertainment-themed centers (ETCs). Our cinemas have served as anchor tenants for our projects, historically providing a steady and reliable source of foot traffic and drawing in other businesses to the area. This had allowed us to have more control over the tenant mix and overall development of our ETCs. Additionally, because we are the anchor tenant, we do not have to go through the process of identifying and negotiating with third-party anchor tenants, providing us with a streamlined and efficient development process. We have successfully utilized this approach at our tree currently operating ETCs (and one to be redeveloped) and are excited about the potential for future developments. We are confident that our cinema-anchored developments will continue to be a key driver of our business and create thriving communities.

The Certainty of Cinema Anchor Tenancies. Our expertise in the cinema industry gives us a significant advantage in developing large-scale retail spaces such as our ETCs. Our cinemas serve as the anchor tenants, creating a bustling and vibrant atmosphere that draws in other businesses to the area. This allows us to carefully curate the tenant mix and shape the overall development of our ETCs. Furthermore, as anchor tenants ourselves, we can streamline the development process without having to negotiate with third-party tenants. We have successfully implemented this approach at our four existing ETCs and are excited about the potential for future developments. In 2021, we monetized our Auburn ETC, retaining a leasehold interest for our cinema there. A profit of $38.7 million was booked on that transaction. We are currently developing plans and strategies to execute as a redevelopment of our fourth ETC in Wellington, NZ. Our cinema-anchored developments are a key strength of our business, and we are confident in their ability to create thriving and dynamic communities.

Flexibility in Property Use. We are always open to the idea of converting an entertainment property to another use, if there is a higher and better use for the property, or to sell individual assets if an attractive opportunity presents itself. Our 44 Union Square property has a long-term lease with Petco for the lower level, ground floor and second floor, which went into effect in the first quarter of 2022.


Our hybrid, multi-country strategy emphasizes diversification, and the building of long-term hard asset values. We believe that this business strategy is proving its worth as we have progressed through and are emerging from the current pandemic. 

As of December 31, 2022, our principal tangible assets included:
interests in 62 cinemas comprising of 505 screens;
fee interests in two live theatres (the Orpheum and Minetta Lane both in Manhattan); 
fee interest in our 44 Union Square property, at which we have leased the lower level, ground floor and second floor to Petco. Petco began paying rent in December 2022, and is now in occupancy of such space on a full rent paying basis. CBRE is currently acting as our exclusive broker for the remainder of the space.
fee interest in one cinema (the Cinemas 1,2,3) in Manhattan, in which we own a 75% managing member interest in the holding limited liability company;
fee interests in two cinemas in Australia (Bundaberg and Maitland) and three cinemas in New Zealand (Dunedin, Napier and Rotorua);
fee interest in our currently operating ETCs in Brisbane (Newmarket Village), Townsville (Cannon Park), and Perth (The Belmont Common) and our ETC currently in the process of redevelopment in Wellington, New Zealand (“Courtenay Central”);
fee interest in our administrative office buildings in Culver City, California and Melbourne, Australia. Both buildings also feature one other third-party tenant; 
fee interest in a 23 acre industrial site with rail access in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, leased to Transco;
in addition to the fee interests described immediately above, fee ownership of approximately 9.1 million square feet of developed and undeveloped real estate in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand; and
cash and cash equivalents, aggregating $29.9 million.
We now present an overview of our business segments.

(1)Our Company has a 33.3% unincorporated joint venture interest in a 16-screen cinema located in Mt. Gravatt, Queensland managed by Event Cinemas.
(2)Our Company is a 50% joint venture partner in two New Zealand Rialto cinemas totaling 13 screens. We are responsible for the booking of these cinemas and our joint venture partner, Event Cinemas, manages their day-to-day operations.
(3)On November 9, 2022, we permanently closed our 10-screen cinema at Ko’olau in Hawaii and on Jan 13, 2023, took over an existing 6-screen cinema in Armadale in Australia.

Subject to current cash flow constraints, we continue to focus on upgrading our existing cinemas, obtaining liquor licenses, and developing new cinema opportunities to provide our customers with premium offerings, including luxury recliner seating, state-of-the-art presentation including sound, lounges, cafés and bar service, and other amenities. Currently, 187 of our auditoriums feature recliner seating (excluding our joint ventures). In addition, 33 of our auditoriums now feature large format TITAN XC, TITAN LUXE, or IMAX screens. Our circuit has been completely converted to digital projection and sound systems. However, in certain of our cinemas we have, as a point of differentiation, retained the ability to show film in the 70MM format preferred by some directors.

Although we operate cinemas in three nations, the general nature of our operations and operating strategies does not vary materially from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction. In each jurisdiction, our gross receipts are primarily from box office receipts, food and beverage sales, gift card purchases, online ticketing fees, and screen advertising. Our ancillary revenue is created principally from theater rentals (for example, for film festivals and special events), and ancillary programming (such as concerts and sporting events).

Our cinemas generated approximately 58% of their 2022 revenue from box office receipts. Ticket prices vary by location, and in selected locations we offer reduced rates for senior citizens, children and, in certain markets, military and students.

Showtimes and features are placed in advertisements on our various websites, on internet sites and, in some markets, in limited instances, local newspapers. We are continually increasing our presence in social media, thereby, reducing our dependency on print advertising. Film distributors may also advertise certain feature films in various print, radio and television media, as well as on the internet, and distributors generally pay those costs. 

F&B sales accounted for approximately 34% of our total 2022 cinema revenue. Although certain cinemas have licenses for the sale and on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages, historically F&B products have been primarily popcorn, candy, and soda. This is changing, as more of our theaters are offering expanded food and beverage offerings. One of our strategic focuses is to upgrade our 

 -  -


 existing cinemas with expanded F&B offerings consistent with what we believe to be the new position of cinemas in the pathway from content provider to consumer. We use SPP as a measure of our performance as compared to the performance of our competitors, as well as a measure of the performance of our food and beverage operations. While ultimately, the profitability of our food and beverage operations depends on a variety of factors, including labor cost and cost of goods sold, we think that this calculation is important to show how well we are doing on a top line basis. 

Screen advertising and other revenue contribute approximately 8% of our total 2022 cinema revenue. With the exception of certain rights that we have retained to sell screen advertising to local advertisers, generally speaking, we are not in the screen advertising business and nationally recognized screen-advertising companies’ contract with us for the right to show such advertising on our screens.

Management of Cinemas

With the exception of our three unconsolidated cinemas, we manage our cinemas with executives located in Los Angeles and Manhattan in the U.S., Melbourne, Australia, and Wellington, New Zealand. Our two New Zealand Rialto cinemas are owned by a joint venture in which Reading New Zealand is a 50% joint venture partner. While we assist in the booking of these two cinemas, our joint venture partner, Event Cinemas, manages their day-to-day operations. Our one-third interest in a 16-screen Brisbane cinema is passive in nature. That cinema is also managed by Event Cinemas.
Licensing and Pricing 

Film product is available from a variety of sources, ranging from the major film distributors, such as Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros, Disney, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures and Lionsgate, to a variety of smaller independent film distributors. In Australia and New Zealand, some of those major distributors distribute through local unaffiliated distributors. Worldwide, the major film distributors dominate the market for mainstream conventional films. In the U.S., art and specialty film is distributed through the art and specialty divisions of these major distributors, such as Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics, and through independent distributors such as A24 and Neon. Film payment terms are generally based on an agreed-upon percentage of box office receipts that will vary from film-to-film.
Competition

Film is allocated by the applicable distributor among competitive cinemas and in an increasingly material number of situations to streaming services. Accordingly, from time to time, we may be unable to license every film that we desire to play. In the Australian and New Zealand markets, we generally have access to all film products in the market. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a rise in streaming services with greater quantity and quality of films offered. We have also seen certain major distributors skip the traditional theatrical window and go straight to streaming, PVOD or Video on Demand (“VOD”). Over the last few years, videos have become an essential component of internet usage, with their prevalence increasing across all online platforms as part of digital marketing strategies. Whether it's through social media, websites, emails, or other communication channels, both short and long videos have emerged as the primary mode of connecting with audiences. 

Moreover, the surge in popularity of video-on-demand platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu is evident. From September 8-19, 2022, selected AMC Theatres celebrated Disney+ Day which showcased beloved films from the Disney catalog. Additionally, in October 2022, a Netflix movie had a one-week theatrical sneak preview across 600 AMC, Regal, and Cinemark theaters in the United States, marking the first time all three major theater chains had agreed to screen a big-budget Netflix film. Along with this partnership, the sequel to "Knives Out," titled "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery," also premiered in select theaters in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Spain, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. 

Competition for films may be intense, depending upon the number of cinemas in a particular competitive market. Our ability to obtain top grossing, first run feature films may be adversely impacted by our comparatively small size, and the limited number of screens and markets that we can supply to distributors. Moreover, because of the dramatic consolidation of screens into the hands of a few very large and powerful exhibitors such as AMC, Cineworld, and Cinemark, who between them control over 57% of the North American market, these mega-exhibition companies are in a position to offer distributors access to many more screens in major markets than we can. Also, the major exhibitors have a significant number of markets where they operate without material competition, meaning that the distributors have no alternative exhibitor for their films in these markets. Accordingly, distributors may decide to give preference to these mega-exhibitors when it comes to licensing top-grossing films, rather than deal with independent exhibitors such as ourselves. The situation is different in Australia and New Zealand, where typically every major multiplex cinema has access to all of the film currently in distribution, regardless of the ownership of that multiplex cinema. However, on the reverse side, we have suffered somewhat in these markets from competition from boutique operators, who are able to book top grossing commercial films for limited runs, thus increasing competition for customers wishing to view such top grossing films. The implementation of a two-year sunset period for block booking and circuit dealing is meant to give movie theaters time to adjust their operations during a period of significant market changes. This prevents the block booking licensing agreements from having a negative impact on independent movie distributors' access to the market by creating a barrier to entry.

The availability of state-of-the-art technology and/or luxury recliner seating can also be a factor in the preference of one cinema over another. In recent periods, a number of cinemas have opened or reopened featuring luxury recliner seating and/or expanded food and beverage service, including the sale of alcoholic beverages and food served to the seat. After significant investment in our cinema portfolio since 2015, our circuit is ready for post COVID-19 recovery. 48% of US screens feature Luxury Recliner Seating. 31% of AU/NZ screens feature Luxury Recliner Seating. 35% of US theaters feature at least one Premium Large Format auditorium (IMAX, TITAN LUXE or TITAN XC) and 53% of AU/NZ theaters feature a PLF Auditorium (TITAN XC or TITAN LUXE). Lastly, 78% of US cinemas offer enhanced F&B menus (including liquor), while 53% of AU/NZ cinemas offer enhanced F&B menus, and 66% of our global cinemas serve liquor.

The film exhibition markets in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are to a certain extent dominated by a limited number of major exhibition companies who have substantial financial resources which could allow them to operate in a more competitive manner than us. Based on information contained in filings made with the SEC, as of December 31, 2022, the principal exhibitors in the United States are AMC (with 7,855 screens in 600 cinemas); Regal (with 6,860 screens in 516 cinemas), owned by Cineworld Group, the U.K.’s largest cinema operator; and Cinemark (with 4,458 screens in 323 cinemas). It is to be noted that these numbers are subject to fluctuations, as Regal and AMC have been shedding screens in the United States in recent periods. As of December 31, 2022, we were the 14th largest exhibitor with 1% of the box office in the United States with 228 screens in 23 cinemas.

The principal exhibitors in Australia are Greater Union, which does business under the Event Cinemas name (a subsidiary of Event Hospitality and Entertainment, Limited) (“Event”), Hoyts Cinemas (“Hoyts”), and Village Cinemas (“Village”). The major exhibitors control approximately 65% of the total cinema box office: Event 29%, Hoyts 24%, and Village 12%. Event has 526 screens nationally, Hoyts 421 screens, and Village 229 screens. By comparison, our 191 screens (excluding our joint venture theaters) represent approximately 8% of the total box office making us the fourth largest exhibitor in Australia. The industry is somewhat vertically integrated in Australia and New Zealand, in that Roadshow Film Distributors, a subsidiary of Village, serves as a distributor of film in Australia and New Zealand.

The principal exhibitors in New Zealand are Event Cinemas with 127 screens and Hoyts with 76 screens, nationally. The major exhibitors in New Zealand control approximately 51% of the total box office: Event 31% and Hoyts 20%. We have 57 screens (excluding its interests in unconsolidated joint ventures). We have 11% of the market (Event and Reading market share figures exclude any partnership theaters) and we are the third largest exhibitor in New Zealand.

In-Home, Streaming and Mobile Device Competition

The in-home streaming and mobile device entertainment industry has experienced significant leaps in recent periods in both the quality and affordability of in-home and mobile device entertainment systems and in the accessibility to, and quality of, entertainment programming through cable, satellite, and internet distribution channels. The success of these alternative distribution channels (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video) and the entrance of new specially curated product for the home and streaming markets are competing with films produced for theatrical release which puts additional pressure on film distributors to reduce and/or eliminate the time period between theatrical and secondary release dates. 

Since 2020 the streaming landscape has experienced significant transformation. In 2022 newly named Paramount Global (formerly Viacom CBS) finally revealed specifics about its streaming services, including the number of Paramount+ subscribers. AT&T is in the process of merging Warner Media, which owns HBO Max, with Discovery Communications. AMC Networks launched a premium AMC+ subscription bundle in Canada and Australia on Apple TV channels and Amazon Prime Video Channels. In December 2020 and December 2021, respectively, we launched our very own streaming service, Angelika Anywhere, in the U.S. and Australia, which is curated for film lovers of independent and foreign film, documentaries, and the more specialized movies from the major studios. Currently our US based website and mobile app have the function which allow guests to instantly book Private Watch Parties online instantly. Our Australia and New Zealand, customers can also book Private VIP via online.

We are responding to these challenges generally by increasing the comfort and service levels available at our cinemas, by offering convenient online ticket reservation services with guaranteed seating, by investing in larger screens and enhanced sound, by offering more specialized and alternative product to our audiences, and by providing value for the moviegoer’s dollar. We are focusing on the fact that going to the movies is a special social experience, and we are working to make that experience the best that it can be. We must differentiate ourselves from other forms of video entertainment by emphasizing the special nature of seeing film and alternative content in a cinema environment and by developing ways to position ourselves to take advantage of the increased output of film and feature product. These are issues common to both our U.S. and international cinema operations. We are proactively adjusting our operating, programming, and marketing strategies to take into account the wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic. We want to grow our cinema-based business through a disciplined approach to renovations and new opportunities globally.

Further competitive issues are discussed under Item 1A – Risk Factors.

Seasonality

Major films are generally released to coincide with holidays. This fact provides some balancing of our revenue because, with the exception of Christmas and New Years, there is no material overlap between holidays in the United States and those in Australia and New Zealand. Distributors will delay, in certain cases, releases in Australia and New Zealand to take advantage of Australian and New Zealand holidays that are not celebrated in the United States. However, the deferral of releases is becoming increasingly less common, given the need to address internet and other channels of distribution that operate on a worldwide basis and are less tied to holiday schedules.

2022 saw some successful releases including Top Gun: Maverick and concluded with the release of Avatar: The Way of Water, but only three films reached the $1 billion mark, which included Jurassic World Dominion. Cinema operators are more hopeful for 2023 as the year offers several highly anticipated releases, such as three Marvel titles, a new Indiana Jones movie, a new Mission: Impossible film featuring a Maverick-boosted Tom Cruise, a second Dune film, the Hunger Games prequel, and highly anticipated adaptations of Wonka, Super Mario Bros, Barbie, and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.

REAL ESTATE

Overall

We engage in the real estate business through the development and our ownership and rental or licensing to third parties of retail, commercial and live theatre assets. We own the fee interests in both our live theatres, and in 10 of our cinemas (as presented in the preceding table within the “Cinema Exhibition” section). Our real estate business creates long-term value for our stockholders through the continuous improvement and development of our investment and operating properties, including our ETCs. 

Our real estate activities have historically consisted principally of: 
the ownership of fee or long-term leasehold interests in properties used in our cinema exhibition activities or which were acquired for the development of cinemas or cinema-based real estate development projects; 
the acquisition of fee interests in land for general real estate development; 
the licensing to production companies of our live theatres; and,
the redevelopment of our existing fee-owned cinema or live theatre sites to their highest and best use. 

All of our leasehold interests are cinema operating properties. We utilize office space at the Village East cinema building for our corporate headquarters.

We have historically made use of third-party agencies to provide the on-site management and leasing administration functions of our Australia and New Zealand sites. In 2020, however, we terminated these arrangements and brought these activities in-house. All of our U.S. real estate operations are managed in-house, with operational support from a third-party for 44 Union Square. 

In addition to our principal properties as set out below, we own certain historic railroad properties (such as our 8.2-acre North Viaduct and adjacent commercial properties in Philadelphia). 

United States

Live Theatres – Minetta Lane and Orpheum

Included among our real estate holdings are two Off-Broadway style live theatres, operated through our Liberty Theatres subsidiary. We license theatre auditoriums to the producers of Off-Broadway theatrical productions and provide various box office and food & beverage services. The terms of our licenses are, naturally, principally dependent upon the commercial success of our tenants. While we attempt to choose productions that we believe will be successful, we have no control over the production itself. At the current time, we have two single-auditorium theatres in Manhattan: 
the Minetta Lane (399 seats); and
the Orpheum (347 seats).

Liberty Theatres is primarily in the business of licensing theatre space. However, we may from time to time participate as an investor in a play, which can help facilitate the exhibition of the play at one of our theatres and do from time to time rent space on a basis that allows us to share in a production’s revenues or profits. Rental revenues, expenses, and profits are reported as part of the real estate segment of our business.

44 Union Square

At the end of 2019, we substantially completed the construction phase of our 44 Union Square redevelopment project, achieving approximately 73,000 square feet of net rentable area (calculated inclusive of anticipated BOMA adjustments) comprised of retail and office space. We have leased all the retail space to Petco for a flagship, state-of-the-art facility. We are currently working with CBRE to lease the office portions of the project. 44 Union Square/Tammany Hall, hailed as a dramatic pièce de résistance with its first in the city, over 800-piece, glass dome, brings the future to New York’s fabled past and in 2022 was awarded the (i) The American Architecture Award for Restoration and Renovation, (ii) the ACEC NY Engineering Excellence Award, (iii) and the Building/Technology Systems Diamond Award. Item 7 – Recent Developments.
5995 Sepulveda Boulevard

We own an approximately 24,000 square foot office building with 72 parking spaces located at 5995 Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, California. We occupy approximately 12,000 square feet of our Culver City office building for administrative purposes. The remainder of the building is leased to an unrelated third-party. Reading purchased the building and acquired an existing A & T Lease on April 8, 2016. An update on this property is provided in Item 7 – Recent Developments. 
Cinemas 1,2,3

We own, through our 75% managing member interest, the fee interest in our Cinemas 1,2,3 property in Manhattan. While we are evaluating the potential to redevelop this property as a mixed-use property, these endeavors have been deferred as we deal with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, located on 3rd avenue, across from Bloomingdales on Manhattan’s Upper Eastside, this property is a prime long-term hold-for-development asset of our Company, and we are confident in the long-term outlook for the New York City commercial market. While we monitor the market for conditions to stabilize, we have been operating the property as a 3-screen cinema by Angelika since March 2021.
Australia

We own and operate three ETCs in Australia. Our revenues from these sites consist of rental income and other ancillary charges from our various tenants.

Newmarket Village

Located on 226,537 square feet of land in suburban Brisbane, Newmarket Village is currently comprised of approximately 165,830 square feet of net rentable area, including a Coles Supermarket and 47 other third-party tenants. We added a state-of-the-art eight-screen Reading Cinemas in December 2017. In 2022, we also executed 2 new leases and 4 renewal leases.
Cannon Park

Comprising 9.4-acres across two properties, Cannon Park City Center and Cannon Park Discount Center. Cannon Park was acquired in December 2015. Our multiplex cinema is one of the anchor tenants for Cannon Park City Center, which features 14 third-party F&B and leisure tenants. In 2022, we executed 1 new lease and 3 renew leases.
The Belmont Common

Anchored by our 10-screen Reading Cinemas and six F&B or third-party tenants, The Belmont Common is located in Perth, Australia, and is currently comprised of 103,204 square feet of land and 60,118 square feet of net rentable area.
New Zealand

Courtenay Central

Located in the heart of Wellington – New Zealand’s capital city – our Courtenay Central ETC is currently under redevelopment and is comprised, on a consolidated basis through various subsidiaries, of 161,071 square feet of land situated (i) proximate to the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum (attracting over 1.5 million visitors annually, pre-COVID), and (ii) across the street from the site of the future Takina, Wellington Convention and Exhibition Center (wcec.co.nz), the capital’s first premium conference and exhibition space, which is due to be completed in 2023, and (iii) across the street from the St. James Theatre which was recently renovated and has strengthened Wellington’s theatre scene. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, construction for this major public project is on track with plans including the creation of a public concourse linking through to Wakefield Street. When it is completed, not only will it be a major generator of foot traffic in the area, but its presence (together with the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum) will provide our property with the potential for 

 -  -


 unhindered view lines over- looking Wellington Harbor. During 2022, our Company completed a second Urban Activation and created a space for the public to enjoy on our Wakefield Street Property in collaboration with Wellington City Council. In the third quarter of 2022, we also favorably resolved disputes regarding our pre-earthquake, pre-COVID development obligations to a third-party tenant which now allows us to proceed with our development and seismic strengthening projects in order to achieve their highest and best use. This pivotal settlement has ultimately provided us a path to freely and strategically work with various stakeholders to advance an overall re-thinking and master plan for our properties and to re-establish our assets as the key Wellington destination for film, families, and fun.

As previously reported, damage from the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake necessitated demolition of our nine-story parking garage at the site, and unrelated seismic issues caused us to close major portions of the existing cinema and retail structure in early 2019. Wellington continues to be rated as one of the top cities in the world in which to live, and we continue to believe that the Courtenay Central site is located in one of the most vibrant and growing commercial and entertainment precinct areas of Wellington. In 2022, the University of Canterbury hailed Wellington as New Zealand’s most walkable city as 35% of all residents lived within a 10-minute walk of all amenities and the Keep New Zealand Beautiful Society designated it as “The Most Beautiful Large City in Aotearoa”. 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the real estate team had developed a comprehensive plan featuring a variety of uses to complement and build upon the “destination quality” of the Courtenay Central location. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, our real estate team is continuing to work with our consultants, potential tenants, and city representatives to advance our redevelopment plans for this property.

Our real estate holdings are described in further detail in Item 2 – Properties. Our real estate developments are described in Item 7 – Recent Developments.

Competition

A summary discussion of our view as to the competitive aspects of the markets where we own real estate properties is as follows:

United States

We believe that the COVID effect, while significant in 2020 and 2021, will not survive in the long-term as the human need for interaction will outweigh the reduced COVID post-vaccine risks. In 2022, we witnessed a return to normalcy as health and safety measures in public spaces subsided and as large gatherings rebounded. To meet this need for human interaction, we expect that U.S. retail real estate owners will continue to reuse the space vacated by anchor retailers to offer a variety of entertainment options and ultimately enhance the customer experience. 

Demand for office space may decline in the near term as corporations adapt to employees’ “work-life balance” and leverage technology to automate tasks. However, our office space offering in the United States is limited. The available space in our Culver City office building is now completely leased. Our 44 Union Square office space is not generic in nature, given its Union Square location, its boutique size and brandability. The retail portion of our 44 Union Square property is now fully leased to Petco.

Australia and New Zealand

Over the past few years, there has been a noted stabilization in real estate market activity resulting in some increases to commercial and retail property values in Australia and to a lesser extent in New Zealand. Both countries have relatively stable economies with varying degrees of economic growth that are mostly influenced by global trends. Also, we have noted that our Australian and New Zealand developed properties have had consistent growth in rentals and values, despite the COVID effects. This is in part a product of the fact that our tenancies have focused on entertainment services (cinemas, food and beverage) and essentials (such as groceries and 

 -  -


 pharmacies), which has to some extent insulated us from internet competition. We remain optimistic that our Australian and New Zealand holdings will continue to provide value and cash flows to our operations.

BUSINESS MIX AND FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACT

At December 31, 2022, the book value of our assets was $587.1 million, and our consolidated stockholders’ book equity was $63.3 million. Calculated based on book value, $267.9 million, or 46% of our assets, relate to our cinema exhibition activities and $247.2 million, or 42%, of our assets, relate to our real estate activities. 



For additional segment financial information, please see Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-- Note 1 – Description of Business and Segment Reporting.

We have diversified our assets among three countries: the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Based on book value, at December 31, 2022, we had approximately 58% of our assets in the United States, 34% in Australia and 8% in New Zealand compared to 49%, 40%, and 11%, respectively, at the end of 2021. This shift in the ratio is principally due to repatriation of the proceeds from the monetization of certain AU and NZ real estate assets to US, and currency fluctuations.

We have worked to maintain a balance both between our cinema and real estate assets and between our U.S. and our Australian and New Zealand assets. In 2022, we invested approximately $4.3 million in our U.S. assets: $1.8 million for the development of our real estate assets (principally for the construction of our 44 Union Square property) and $2.5 million for the improvements of our cinema assets (principally the renovations of our cinema at Kapolei, and upgrades of certain other cinemas). We invested approximately $3.2 million in our Australia asset, primarily for the development of our cinema assets (principally the fit-out of our new South City Square eight-screen complex and Busselton five-screen reading cinema). We invested approximately $1.5 million in our New Zealand assets: $1.1 million for our Invercargill cinema renovation and $0.4 million was used for the development of real estate assets (principally on the predevelopment of our Courtenay Central asset). 

At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $29.9 million, which are treated as corporate assets. Our cash included $24.0 million denominated in U.S. dollars, $4.9 million (AU$7.2 million) in Australian dollars, and $1.1 million (NZ$1.7 million) in New Zealand dollars. We had total worldwide non-current assets of $539.6 million, distributed as follows: $300.0 million in the United States, $192.1 million (AU$320.0 million) in Australia and $47.5 million (NZ$74.8 million) in New Zealand. We had no unrestricted unused capacity of available corporate credit facilities on December 31, 2022.

For 2022, our gross revenues in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand were $100.1 million, $87.8 million, and $15.2 million, respectively, compared to $61.8 million, $64.7 million, and $12.6 million for 2021. All three countries posted revenue increases in 2022 as a result of no mandated COVID-19 related closures in 2022, compared to 2021 due to the wide distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and better film releases.

As shown in the chart set forth in the International Business Risks section, exchange rates for the currencies of these jurisdictions have varied, sometimes materially. These ratios naturally have an impact on our revenues and asset values, which are reported in USD.   The U.S. dollar is trading at or about a ten year high compared to the Australian and New Zealand Dollar, which has the effect of reducing the value of our Australia and New Zealand earnings and cash flow from a U.S. point of view. Notwithstanding these fluctuations, we continue to believe that, over the long term, operating in Australia and New Zealand is a prudent diversification of risk. Australia has been identified by the United Nations to be among the Top 10 countries in the World in terms of natural resources per person. Deutsche Bank has twice named Wellington the best place in the world to live. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has twice rated Australia as the best place to live and work in the world. In our view, the economies of Australia and New Zealand are stable economies, and their lifestyles support our entertainment/lifestyle focus. 

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our company is committed to diversity and does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs or practices or any other protected characteristics. We strive to recruit and retain a diverse group of employees. Our board of directors is comprised of three women (including our Chair, Vice Chair and Chair of our Compensation Committee) and two men.

Our cinemas typically employ persons from the communities that they serve and accordingly, we believe that they reasonably reflect the diversification of such communities. Many of our jobs are entry level positions and offer comparatively flexible hours attractive to students and others seeking part time employment. We believe that we provide a starting point for younger people entering the job market for the first time, as well as an opportunity for individuals with other life commitments and interests and who are not seeking full time employment. Finding and retaining cinema staff has been a challenge in the post COVID period.

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately (i) 89 executive/administrative and 8 real estate employees who were primarily full-time and (ii) 20 live theatre and 1,908 cinema employees worldwide who were predominantly part-time/casual employees. A small number of our cinema employees in New Zealand are union members, as are our projectionists in Hawaii. None of our Australian-based employees or other employees are subject to union contracts. Overall, we are of the view that the existence of these collective bargaining agreements does not materially increase our costs of labor or our ability to compete.

We offer our employees a competitive benefits package. In the U.S., we offer a 401(k)-retirement savings plan (our “401(k) Plan”) that allows eligible U.S. employees to defer a portion of their compensation, within limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, on a pre- and post-tax basis through contributions to the plan. We match contributions made by participants in our 401(k) Plan up to a specified percentage, and these matching contributions are fully vested as of the date on which the contributions are made. Currently, matching has been deferred as allowed by our 401(k)-plan due to COVID-19. For our employees in Australia and New Zealand, we offer superannuation plans in line with the requirements as they pertain to each government. We believe that providing a vehicle for retirement savings through our 401(k) Plan or superannuation plan, and making fully vested matching contributions in the U.S., in accordance with our compensation policies, adds to the overall desirability of our employee compensation package and further incentivizes our employees. 

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) designed to help our Directors and employees resolve ethical issues. Our Code of Conduct applies to all Directors and employees and is posted on our website. Our Board has established a means for employees to report a violation or suspected violation of the Code of Conduct anonymously. In addition, we have adopted an “Amended and Restated Whistleblower Policy and Procedures,” which is also posted on our website, and establishes a process by which employees may anonymously disclose to our Principal Compliance Officer alleged fraud or violations of accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. We are firm supporters of equal rights and diversity, and have accordingly adopted the Anti-Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy posted on our website.

Our Green Initiatives.

We strive to do our part in the fight against climate change. 

United States

In our U.S. theaters we are looking at transitioning to paper straws and bamboo biodegradable cutlery in the immediate future. We provide recycle bins at all of our theaters. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we completed a variety of energy enhancements, including the installation of (i) LED Lighting retrofits to lower KWH Usage and reduce our energy consumption across all the theatres, (ii) modern and smart EMS systems at various locations, to efficiently control the current HVAC systems, and (iii) replacement HVAC package units to improve our carbon footprint. 
Australia and New Zealand

In our theaters in Australia and New Zealand, we are (i) using commercially compostable bamboo takeaway cutlery nationally, (ii) using commercially compostable paper straws (which are individually wrapped in paper to ensure we are COVID safe), (iii) using commercially compostable soft drink cold cups, coffee cups, popcorn boxes, takeaway pizza boxes and takeaway clamshell hot food boxes. We have achieved our 2021 goal to source only commercially compostable packaging, we expect all AU/NZ locations in Q2 2022 to be 100% converted to the new environmentally friendly stock. At our Burwood cinema in Australia, we are separating waste into three waste streams (compostable material/general waste/recyclable). At our Belmont ETC in Australia, we have installed Solar Panels to minimize our reliance on non-renewable energies.
