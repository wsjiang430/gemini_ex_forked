ITEM 1. BUSINESS

ENGlobal Corporation (which may be referred to as “ENGlobal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 1994, is a leading provider of innovative, delivered project solutions primarily to the energy industry. We deliver these solutions to our clients by combining our vertically-integrated engineering and professional project execution services with our automation and systems integration expertise and our fabrication and construction capabilities. We believe our vertically-integrated strategy allows us to differentiate our company from most of our competitors as a full-service provider, thereby reducing our clients’ dependency on and coordination of multiple vendors and improving control over their project cost and schedules. Our strategy and positioning has also allowed the Company to pursue larger scopes of work centered around many different types of modularized engineered systems. All of the information contained in this Report relates to the annual periods ended December 31, 2022, which contained 53 weeks, and December 25, 2021, which contained 52 weeks.

We derive revenues primarily from three sources: (i) business development efforts, (ii) preferred provider or alliance agreements with strategic end-user clients, original equipment manufacturers, and technology partners, and (iii) referrals from existing customers and industry members. Our business development professionals are focused on specific market segments within the energy industry. The market segments that we are targeting include Renewables, Automation, Oil, Gas, and Petrochemicals, and Government Services. This market focus allows us to develop centers of expertise for each of our targeted markets. 

We generally enter into two principal types of contracts with our clients: time-and-material contracts and fixed-price contracts. Our clients typically determine the type of contract to be utilized for a particular engagement, with the specific terms and conditions of a contract being negotiated and typically contained in a multiyear services agreement.

Our business development professionals focus on building long-term relationships with clients in order to provide solutions throughout the life cycle of their projects and facilities. Additionally, we seek to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities between our market segments and many of our projects will contain elements from more than one market segment. Sales leads are often jointly developed and pursued by our business development personnel from multiple markets.

Products and services are also promoted through trade advertising, participation in industry conferences and on-line internet communication via our corporate home page at www.englobal.com. The ENGlobal website illustrates our company’s full range of services and capabilities and is updated on a continuous basis. Through the ENGlobal website, we seek to provide visitors and investors with a single point of contact for obtaining information about our company. Information on our website or any other website is not a part of this Report.

Client relationships are nurtured by our geographic advantage of having office locations near our larger customers. By having clients in close proximity, we are able to provide single, dedicated points of contact. Our growth depends in large measure on our ability to attract and retain qualified business development personnel with a respected reputation in the energy industry. Management believes that in-house marketing allows for more accountability and control, thus increasing profitability. We develop preferred provider and alliance agreements with clients in order to facilitate repeat business. These preferred provider agreements, also known as master services or umbrella agreements (“MSAs”) typically have a duration of three to five years. This allows our clients to release work to us without having to negotiate contract terms for each individual project. With the primary terms of the contract agreed to, add-on projects with these customers are easier to negotiate and can be accepted quickly, without the necessity of a bidding process. Management believes that these agreements can serve to stabilize project-centered operations.

We have identified four strategic markets where we have a long history of delivering project solutions and can provide complete project execution and have focused our business development teams on communicating these offerings to their clients. These four targeted markets include: (i) Renewables, (ii) Automation, (iii) Oil, Gas, and Petrochemicals, and (iv) Government Services.

Within the Renewables group, our focus is to design and build production facilities for hydrogen and associated products, together with converting existing production facilities to produce products from renewable feedstock sources. These projects often utilize technologies that are more fuel efficient, and therefore reduce the associated carbon footprint of the facility. Our scope of work on these projects will typically include front-end development, engineering, procurement, mechanical fabrication, automation and commissioning services, and may be performed in conjunction with a construction partner.

Our Automation group designs, integrates and commissions modular systems that include electronic distributed control, on-line process analytical data, continuous emission monitoring, and electric power distribution. Often these packaged systems are housed in a fabricated metal enclosure, modular building or freestanding metal rack, which are commonly included in our scope of work. We provide automation engineering, procurement, fabrication, systems integration, programing and on-site commissioning services to our clients for both new and existing facilities.

Our Oil, Gas, and Petrochemical group focuses on providing engineering, procurement, construction, and automation services as well as fabricated products to downstream refineries and petrochemical facilities as well as midstream pipeline, storage and other transportation related companies. These services are often applied to small capital improvement and maintenance projects within refineries and petrochemical facilities. For our transportation clients, we work on facilities that include pumping, compression, gas processing, metering, storage terminals, product loading and blending systems. In addition, this group designs, programs and maintains supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) systems for our transportation clients. This group also provides engineering, fabrication and automation services to clients who have operations in the U.S. oil and gas exploration and development markets. The operations are usually associated with the completion, purification, storage and transmission of the oil and gas from the well head to the terminal or pipeline destination.

Our Government Services group provides services related to the engineering, design, installation and maintenance of automated fuel handling and tank gauging systems for the U.S. military across the globe.

We have positioned ourselves as a full-service, vertically-integrated supplier in order to better accommodate the requests of our clients and capture opportunities of larger scope. A majority of these opportunities are expected to be in all sectors of the energy industry; however, some may be outside the energy sector. One result of our sales efforts is that our proposal pipeline continues to increase as we are now focused on selling complete packaged solutions as opposed to our past focus of primarily selling consultant man hours. Many of these proposals have very long lead times and have exceeded our expected award timing, which would imply that many of our customers will release awards when they are more confident that commodity prices have stabilized at a sufficient level or foreseeable time period. Backlog represents an estimate of gross revenues of all awarded contracts that have not been completed and will be recognized as revenue over the life of the project. Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Further, most contracts with clients may be terminated by either party at will, in which case the client would only be obligated to pay us for services provided through the termination date. A significant portion of our revenue is generated through MSAs with our clients. Projects awarded under these MSAs tend to be smaller in nature, but continuously awarded as each one is completed. In these instances, only the current unfinished projects are included in our backlog. Additionally, we have historically performed work under longer term contracts with the U.S. Navy that were generally renewed, released or awarded on an annual basis. Recently, the federal government has begun changing the contracting agency for this work. This has created some delays to the contracting sequence. At December 31, 2022, our backlog was $20.4 million. Of this amount, $14.9 million was for our Commercial segment and $5.5 million was for our Government segment. This compares to a total backlog of $12.8 million as of December 25, 2021 with $7.0 million for our Commercial segment and $5.8 million for our Government segment.

We continue to be mindful of our overhead structure. We have made significant investments in key business development and other essential personnel, product developments and new facilities and equipment, which all have negatively impacted our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense. While we believe the addition of these key personnel will allow the Company to expand its client base and acquire new projects, we recognize that the level of our SG&A is greater than it could be for a company our size and have started efforts to reduce headcount, reduce office and shop space, and implement other cost saving measures to address our lack of profitability. If anticipated revenue levels are not achieved to support the reduced level of our SG&A, we will continue these efforts to reduce SG&A expense. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022 we recorded a $1.9 million bad debt reserve due to a contract dispute with one of our major customers.

Our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, need for additional financing and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain such financing, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have limited cash on hand and will need additional working capital to fund our planned operations. We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional capital to fund our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business. We intend to raise funds through various potential sources, such as equity or debt financings; however, we can provide no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available or we do not achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, we may be required to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and our business would be jeopardized.

Reporting Segments

Our Commercial and Government segments are strategic business units that offer different services and products and therefore require different marketing and management strategies. Separate operational leaders are in charge of our engineering offices and our automation offices, including the office that contracts with government agencies. The operating performance of our segments is regularly reviewed with the operational leaders of the two segments, the Executive Chairman (“CEO”), the chief financial officer (“CFO”) and others. This group represents the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for ENGlobal.

Our corporate and other expenses that do not individually meet the criteria for segment reporting are reported separately as Corporate expenses.

Products and Services

The Commercial segment provides multi-disciplined engineering services and fabrication relating to the development, management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project management services primarily to the energy industry throughout the United States. The Commercial segment currently operates through ENGlobal’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ENGlobal U.S., Inc. (“ENGlobal U.S.”). ENGlobal’s engineering staff has the capability of developing a project from the initial planning stages through detailed design and construction management. Our services include conceptual studies, project definition, cost estimating, engineering design, environmental compliance, material procurement, project management, construction management and fabrication.

The Commercial segment derives revenue on contracts from time-and-material fees charged for professional and technical services. Its operating income is derived primarily from services it provides to the oil and gas industry. We also enter into contracts providing for the execution of projects on a fixed-price basis, whereby some, or all, of the project activities related to engineering, material procurement, construction management, automation, integration, and fabrication are performed for a fixed amount.

The Government segment provides services related to the design, integration and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems, advanced automated data gathering systems, information technology and the maintenance of these systems primarily to the U.S. Government globally. The Government segment operates through ENGlobal’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ENGlobal Government Services, Inc. (“EGS”). 

EGS primarily provides automated fuel handling systems and maintenance services to branches of the U.S. military and public sector entities. Other clients of this division are government agencies, refineries, petrochemical and process industry customers worldwide. EGS provides electrical and instrument installation, technical services, and ongoing maintenance, calibration and repair services.

Competition

Our Commercial segment competes with a large number of public and private firms of various sizes, ranging from the industry’s largest firms, which operate on a worldwide basis to much smaller regional and local firms. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them than we do. However, the largest firms in our industry are sometimes our clients, performing as program managers for very large-scale projects who subcontract a portion of their work to us. We also have many competitors who are smaller than us and who, as a result, may be able to offer services at more competitive prices.

Competition is centered on performance and the ability to provide the engineering, planning and project delivery skills required for completing projects in a timely, cost-efficient manner. The expertise of our management and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors.

Our Government segment competes with a large number of public and private firms of various sizes, ranging from the industry’s largest firms, which operate on a worldwide basis to much smaller regional and local firms. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them than we do. We also have many competitors who are smaller than us and who, as a result, may be able to offer services at more competitive prices.

Competition is centered on performance and the ability to provide the engineering, assembly and integration required to complete projects in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The technical expertise of our management team and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors.

Customers

Our customer base consists primarily of Fortune 500 companies in the energy industry and the U.S. government. While we do not have continuing dependence on any single client or a limited group of clients, one or a few clients may contribute a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year or over a period of several consecutive years due to the longevity of major projects, such as facility upgrades or expansions. ENGlobal may work for many different subsidiaries or divisions of a client. The loss of a single large customer, including all of its subsidiaries or divisions, or the reduction in demand for our services by several customers in the same year could have a material impact on our financial results. We continue to focus substantial attention on improving customer services in order to enhance satisfaction and increase customer retention. Revenue generated through sources such as preferred provider relationships are longer term in nature and are not typically limited to one project.

A significant long-term trend among our clients and their industry counterparts has been outsourcing engineering services. This trend has fostered the development of ongoing, longer-term client arrangements. These arrangements vary in scope, duration and degree of commitment. While there is typically no guarantee that work will result from these agreements, often the arrangements form the basis for a longer-term client relationship. Despite their variety, we believe that these partnering relationships have a stabilizing influence on our revenue.

Overall, our ten largest customers, who vary from one period to the next, accounted for 66.0% of our total revenues for 2022 and 86.0% of our total revenues for 2021. Most of our projects are specific in nature and we generally have multiple projects with the same clients. If we were to lose one or more of our significant clients and were unable to replace them with other customers or other projects, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our top two clients in 2022 were a contractor completing a renewable diesel facility and the U.S. Government. Even though we frequently receive work from repeat clients, our client list may vary significantly from year to year. Our potential revenue in all segments is dependent on continuing relationships with our customers. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we had approximately 59 and 69 active customers, respectively.

Suppliers

Our ability to provide clients with services and systems in a timely and competitive manner depends on the availability of products and parts from our suppliers at competitive prices and on reasonable terms. Our suppliers are not obligated to have products on hand for timely delivery nor can they guarantee product availability in sufficient quantities to meet our demands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary supplies at prices or on terms we find acceptable. However, in an effort to maximize availability and maintain quality control, we generally procure components from multiple distributors on our clients’ behalf and in some cases we can take advantage of national agreements our clients may have entered into.

For example, all of the product components used by our Government segment are assembled using components and materials that are available from numerous domestic manufacturers and suppliers. There are approximately five principal suppliers of distributed control systems, each of which can be replaced by an equally viable competitor, and our clients typically direct the selection of their preferred supplier. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, we anticipate little or no difficulty in obtaining components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner to support our installation and assembly operations in the Government segment. Units produced through the Government segment are not produced for inventory and component parts; rather, they are typically purchased on an as-needed basis. By being vendor neutral, ENGlobal is able to provide quality technology and platforms for the design of plant systems such as 3D modeling, process simulation and other technical applications.

Despite the foregoing, our Government segment relies on certain suppliers for necessary components and there can be no assurance that these components will continue to be available on acceptable terms. If a vendor does not continue to contract with us, it may be difficult to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. While we do not believe that such a disruption is likely, if it did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, which we do primarily through protection of our trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued our “Integrated Rack” patent No. 7,419,061 B1 in 2008, our “Universal Master Control Station System” patent No. 8,601,491 B1 in 2013, our “Modular HVAC System for Providing Positive Pressure to an Interior of a Positive Pressure Facility” patent No. 8,670,870 in 2014, our “Method of Controlling a Plurality of Master Control Stations” patent No. 8,959,447 B1 and our “Client Configuration Tool” patent No. 8,983,636 B1 in 2015.

Our trade names are protected by registration as well as by common law trademark rights. Our trademark for the use of “ENGlobal” ® - “Engineered for Growth” ®, and “viMAC” ® in connection with our products are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and we claim common law trademark rights for “ENGlobal” TM in connection with our services. We also claim common law trademark rights for “Global Thinking…Global Solutions” TM, “CARES - Communicating Appropriate Responses in Emergency Situations” TM, “riFAT” TM, “ACE” TM, and “ENGlobal Power Islands” TM.

There can be no assurance that the protective measures we currently employ will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of our technology, or the independent, third-party development of the same or similar technology. Although our competitive position to some extent depends on our ability to protect our proprietary and trade secret information, we believe that other factors, such as the technical expertise and knowledge base of our management and technical personnel, as well as the timeliness and quality of the support services we provide, will also help us to maintain our competitive position.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), Human Capital, and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

Workforce Composition

As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 302 individuals on a full-time equivalent basis compared to approximately 198 individuals on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 25, 2021. The 52.5% increase in personnel in 2022 was attributable to the start-up of our field services and construction divisions, and increased staffing levels to address the increase in project volume during the year and the anticipated growth in 2023. We believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled and experienced professional and technical personnel has been and will continue to be critical to our ability to execute our business plan. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Diversity and Inclusion

As a company focused on internal collaboration to achieve common goals and partnerships with a diverse group of stakeholders to optimize value, we believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success. As such, we endeavor to create an environment rich in diversity that welcomes those of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and experiences. We employ people from a diverse number of nationalities and ethnicities. Nearly 49% of our workforce is comprised of racial minority groups; approximately 15% of our workforce is female. 

ENGlobal is committed to balance in our hiring practices and workplaces. Our recruiting efforts, development opportunities and retention initiatives include a focus on promoting gender and ethnicity balance in the workplace. As a contractor for various governmental entities we provide certain assurances of our initiatives related to workplace diversity. 

We also are dedicated to the development and training of our workforce. Training begins with onboarding with job-specific instruction, integrating safety expectations, corporate ethics and behaviors that focus on workplace inclusion. 

Benefits

We provide employees health and welfare benefits standard for the industry and their location of employment. All employees and their families (upon meeting eligibility requirements) are eligible to participate in the Company’s health insurance plan as well as the Company’s defined contribution (401(k)) plan with a discretionary Company match. 
Health and Safety

Safety is one of our core values. We endeavor to make certain our employees have access to preventive policies, procedures, programs, and training as we work toward an accident-free workplace. 

Our human capital initiatives are implemented by senior leadership with oversight from our Board of Directors. The Board’s Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees oversee our human capital-related policies, programs, and initiatives that focus on diversity and benefits including employee safety, health and wellness matters.

Government Regulations

ENGlobal and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to our business and operations, and various health and safety regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). We are subject to a variety of state, local and foreign licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements governing the practice of engineering and other professional disciplines. For example, OSHA requires Process Safety Management to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, the Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that pipeline operators are in full compliance with pipeline safety regulations, and the Environmental and Protection Agency (EPA) provides incentives to reduce chemical emissions. Currently, we are not aware of any situation or condition relating to the regulation of the Company, its subsidiaries, or personnel that we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Benefit Plans

ENGlobal sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan for its employees. The Company, at the direction of the Board of Directors, may make discretionary contributions. The Company reinstated the match of employees’ deferrals effective May 29, 2022. The Company matches 33% of employee deferrals up to 6% of eligible pre-tax compensation, for a maximum Company matching contribution of 2%.
