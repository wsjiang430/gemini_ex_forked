Gathering System Operations
Epsilon Energy USA is the 100% owner of Epsilon Midstream, which owns a 35% undivided interest in the Auburn GGS, located in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, with partners Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC (43.875%) and Equinor Pipelines, LLC (21.125%). The Anchor Shippers, consisting of Epsilon Energy USA, Equinor USA Onshore Properties, Inc., and Chesapeake Energy Corporation, dedicated approximately 18,000 mineral acres to the Auburn GGS for an initial term of 15 years under an operating agreement whereby the Auburn GGS owners receive a fixed percentage rate of return on the total capital invested in the construction of the system.
The gathering rate of the Auburn GGS is determined by a cost of service model whereby the Anchor Shippers dedicate acreage and reserves to the gas gathering system in exchange for the Auburn GGS owners agreeing to an 18% contractual rate of return on invested capital. The term of this arrangement is 15 years commencing January 1, 2012 and expiring December 31, 2026. Each year, the Auburn GGS historical and forecast throughput, revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures are entered into the cost of service model. The model then computes the new gathering rate that will yield the contractual rate of return to the Auburn GGS owners. In January 2027, the Auburn GGS will transition to a

​




​
​

fixed gathering rate.
Revenues from the Auburn GGS are earned primarily from the Anchor Shippers. Revenues are also earned from third-party customers of the system to transport gas from the wellhead to the compression facility, and then to the delivery meter at Tennessee Gas Pipeline. The relative mix of Anchor Shipper gas and third-party gas is critical to the revenue and earnings of the Auburn GGS because the third-party gathering rate is only 25% of the Anchor Shipper rate. Third-party shippers must pay the gathering rate of the originating gathering system plus 25% of the Auburn GGS gathering rate. The purpose of the reduced rate is to attract additional volumes that require delivery to Tennessee Gas Pipeline when there is spare capacity at the Auburn compression facility, or the “Auburn CF”. Throughput at the Auburn CF has declined from 100.1 Bcf in 2018 to 66.3 Bcf in 2022, a decrease of 34%. However, Anchor Shipper gas as a percentage of total throughput has increased from 57% in 2018 to 71% in 2022. As a result of this shift toward a higher percentage of Anchor Shipper gas, revenues and earnings for the gathering system have only declined 21% and 15%, respectively, from 2018 to 2022.
The Auburn GGS consists of approximately 44 miles of gathering pipelines, a small auxiliary compression facility and a main compression facility with three dehydration units and three Caterpillar 3612 compression units. At inception, the capacity of the Auburn CF was approximately 330,000 Mcf per day at a design suction pressure of 800 psig. The design suction pressure was subsequently reduced to 550 psig in June 2020 at the request of the Anchor Shippers. This request served to minimize throughput decline during a period of low pricing in which the drilling of new wells was undesirable. Operating at the lower design suction pressure also has the benefit of reducing hydrate occurrences in the system which can pose an operational hazard. The current system capacity of the Auburn CF at this lower design pressure is approximately 220,000 Mcf per day. The facility capacity could be increased again, if required, by either adding compression units or increasing the design suction pressure.
The Auburn CF delivers processed natural gas into the Tennessee Gas Pipeline at the Shoemaker Dehy receipt meter. The Auburn GGS is connected with the adjacent Rome GGS, which allows for the receipt of additional natural gas to maximize utilization of the Auburn CF and Tennessee Gas Pipeline meter capacity.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Auburn GGS delivered 66.3 Bcf and 63.2 Bcf respectively, of natural gas, or 182 and 173 MMcf per day.
Revenues derived from Epsilon’s production which have been eliminated from gathering system revenues amounted to $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

​
​

of one well in Pennsylvania and three wells in Oklahoma.
We have not engaged in any exploration capital spending in 2022 or 2021. Our development capital spending to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for the periods indicated is as follows:

● | In 2022 in Pennsylvania, 5 gross (0.05 net) wells were drilled and 4 gross (0.21 net) completed. (Net development capital $2.5 million). Reserves of 5.4 Bcf for the 1 well with proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified as proved developed producing as this well was turned online in August 2022. Additionally, 2 gross (0.02 net) wells were drilled in 2022, but not completed (development capital $0.1 million). They were completed and turned online in January 2023.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2021 in Pennsylvania, 3 gross (0.42 net) wells were drilled and 3 gross (0.27 net) completed. (Net development capital $4.1 million). Reserves of 4.6 Bcf for the 3 wells were reclassified as proved developed producing as these wells were turned online at various times beginning in January and going through October of 2021. Additionally, 1 gross (0.18 net) well was drilled in 2021, but not completed (development capital $0.2 million).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2022 in Oklahoma, we drilled 2 gross (0.26 net) wells and completed 3 gross (0.7 net) wells. (Net development capital $5.4 million). Reserves of 2.9 Bcfe for the 3 wells were reclassified as proved developed producing as these wells were tuned online at various times beginning in March 2022 and going through October 2022. One gross (0.11 net) well was drilled in 2022, but not completed. It is scheduled to be completed in April 2023.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2021 in Oklahoma, we drilled 4 gross (0.75 net) wells and completed 2 gross (0.6 net) wells. (Net development capital $3.0 million). Reserves of 2.8 Bcfe were reclassified as proved developed producing.

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process and Qualifications of Technical Persons with Oversight for the Company’s Overall Reserve Estimation Process
Our policies regarding internal controls over reserve estimates require reserves to be prepared by an independent engineering firm under the supervision of our Chief Operating Officer, and to be in compliance with generally accepted geologic, petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. The corporate staff interacts with our internal petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals in each of our operating areas and with operating, accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for the reserves estimation process. We provide our engineering firm with property interests, production, capital budgets, current operating costs, current production prices and other information. This information is reviewed by our Chief Operating Officer to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to submission to our independent engineering firm. Reserves are reviewed and approved internally by our Chief Operating Officer on a semi-annual basis. Our Chief Operating Officer holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and received a Master’s Degree of Business Administration. He has over 30 years of experience in upstream exploration and production, and has managed all phases of drilling, completions, production and field operations.
The reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent petroleum consultants. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC and with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (revised June 2019) Approved by the SPE Board on 25 June 2019” and in Monograph 3 and Monograph 4 published by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
For the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs, a performance-based methodology integrating the appropriate geology and petroleum engineering data was utilized for this report. Performance-based methodology primarily includes 

10
​




​
​

(1) production diagnostics, (2) decline-curve analysis, and (3) model-based analysis (if necessary, based on availability of data). Production diagnostics include data quality control, identification of flow regimes, and characteristic well performance behavior. These analyses were performed for all well groupings (or type-curve areas).
The person responsible for preparing the reserve report, Dilhan Ilk, is a Registered Professional Engineer (No.139334) in the State of Texas and a Senior Vice President of the firm. Mr. Ilk graduated from Texas A&M University with a Doctor in Philosophy degree in Petroleum Engineering, is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, and has in excess of 11 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations. 
Marketing and Major Customers
Natural gas marketing is competitive in northeast Pennsylvania because of the limited interstate transportation capacity and ample natural gas supply. We do not currently own any firm transportation on interstate pipelines that would enable us to diversify our natural gas sales to downstream customers. As a result, all of our Pennsylvania gas sales occur in Zone 4 of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline at the Shoemaker Dehy meter, which is the receipt point from the Auburn CF.
Epsilon uses a third-party service, ARM Energy Management LLC (“ARM”) for its natural gas marketing. In this capacity, ARM is responsible for carrying out marketing activities such as submission of nominations, receipt of payments, submission of invoices and negotiation of contracts.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold natural gas through ARM to 26 unique customers. Direct Energy Business Marketing, LLC and EQT Energy, LLC each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold natural gas through ARM to 30 unique customers. Direct Energy Business Marketing, LLC and SWN Energy Services Company, LLC each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue.
Geographic Locations of Operations
Approximately 91% and 93% of our production during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was derived from natural gas production and gathering system revenues in the state of Pennsylvania. Our asset in Pennsylvania has not yet reached the mature stage, but at some point, we may need to acquire and develop other producing assets to maintain our current level or to grow.
As a result of this geographic concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, weather events or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil or natural gas.
Competition
It is not uncommon in the oil and natural gas industry to experience shortages of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, pipe, services, and personnel, which can cause both delays in development drilling activities and significant cost increases. We are exposed to the risk of industry competition for drilling rigs, completion rigs and availability of related equipment and services, among other goods and services required in our business.
Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the “JOBS Act”. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

Legal Proceedings
On March 10, 2021, Epsilon filed a complaint against Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC (“Chesapeake”) in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Scranton, Pennsylvania (“Middle District”). Epsilon claims that Chesapeake has breached a settlement agreement and several operating agreements (“JOAs”) to which Epsilon and Chesapeake are parties. Epsilon asserts that Chesapeake has failed to cooperate with Epsilon’s efforts to develop resources in the Auburn Development, located in Northeast Pennsylvania, as required under both the settlement agreement and JOAs. 
Epsilon requested a preliminary injunction but was unsuccessful in obtaining that injunction.  Epsilon filed a motion to amend its original Complaint. Chesapeake opposed. The Court ruled in Epsilon’s favor and allowed 

12
​




​
​

Epsilon’s amendment. Chesapeake moved to dismiss the amended Complaint. The Court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice to Epsilon’s right to file a new lawsuit based on new proposals made after the Court’s decision. Epsilon filed a motion for reconsideration of that decision, but the court denied the motion for reconsideration on January 18, 2022.
Epsilon filed a notice of appeal on February 15, 2022 challenging both the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration decisions.  Chesapeake filed a cross-appeal on March 1, 2022.  A briefing schedule was set and briefing closed October 14, 2022.  Oral argument was held in January 2023.  A decision on the appeal is not expected until mid-2023.
Epsilon re-filed a complaint against Chesapeake in the Middle District on May 9, 2022.  Epsilon generally asserts similar claims as in the previous suit, pursuing declaratory judgment claims regarding Chesapeake’s obligation to Epsilon to cooperate with Epsilon’s efforts in the Auburn Development and regarding Chesapeake’s obstruction of Epsilon’s efforts with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection permitting process but not based on specific well proposals.  Chesapeake filed a motion to stay pending a decision on the Third Circuit appeal, which was granted.  The matter is stayed pending a decision from the Third Circuit.
Regulation
Environmental Regulation
Epsilon is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the handling, management, disposal and discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or that may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may:

● | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases Epsilon’s overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on Epsilon’s operations, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, it is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that Epsilon will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations. However, given that such laws and regulations are subject to change, Epsilon is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on Epsilon’s operations, financial condition and results of operations.
Climate Change
There is consensus in the international scientific community that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) in the atmosphere will produce changes to global, as well as local, climate. Scientists project that increased concentrations of GHGs will cause more frequent, and more powerful storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations, as well as operations of our third party providers and customers, could be adversely affected. To date, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address potential impacts of climate change on our operations and there can be no assurance that any such impacts would not have

an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Attempts to address GHGs, as well as climate change more generally, have taken the form of local, state, national and international proposals. Broadly speaking, examples include cap-and-trade programs, carbon tax proposals, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHGs from certain sources.
In the United States, federal proposals are rooted in the EPA’s “endangerment finding,” that was upheld by the Supreme Court. Simply, EPA has concluded that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment. For example, the EPA adopted regulations that require Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction under Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that constitute major sources of emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards. 
Rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from designated sources in the United States on an annual basis, including, oil and natural gas production facilities and processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations, have been adopted. The EPA has expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities.
Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane from natural gas operations. In 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”), known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain facilities to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. EPA published amendments to those regulations effective September 15, 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order directing EPA to consider suspending, revising or rescinding the September 15, 2020 amendments and also to consider proposing new regulations governing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and gas sector operations. 
In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaking from oil and natural gas operations on public lands. A federal district court vacated much of that rule in October 2020 and that decision is now subject to an appeal. 
Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a non-binding agreement in France for nations to limit their GHG emissions through country-determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 (the “Paris Agreement”). Although the Trump Administration subsequently announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, on January 20, 2021 President Biden issued an Executive Order providing that he was accepting the Paris Agreement on behalf of the United States. 
In addition, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities.
Epsilon is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future, laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions. Any limits on GHG emissions, however, could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our gas gathering services. We are currently unable to calculate or predict the direct and indirect costs of GHG or climate change related laws, regulations and treaties, and accordingly, we cannot assure you that any such efforts will not have a material impact on our operations, financial condition and results.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has finalized a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. In 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 requesting comments related to disclosure for hydraulic fracturing chemicals. The Department of the Interior had released final regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on

​




​
​

federal and Native American oil and natural gas leases which require lessees to file for approval of well stimulation work before commencement of operations and require well operators to disclose the trade names and purposes of additives used in the fracturing fluids. However, in December 2017, the Bureau of Land Management published a final rule rescinding the March 26, 2015 rule (“BLM 2015 Rule”), entitled “Natural gas and oil; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands.” The primary purposes of the BLM 2015 Rule were to ensure that wells were constructed so as to protect water supplies, to ensure environmentally responsible management of fluids displaced by fracturing, and to provide public disclosure of chemicals used in fracturing operations. The net effect of the December 2017 rule making is to return the affected sections of the Code of Federal Regulations to the language that existed before the BLM’s 2015 Rule. In addition, legislation has from time to time been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for additional federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require additional disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.
Epsilon is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the United States, but there can be no assurance that the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) would not materially and adversely affect Epsilon’s operations, financial condition and results of operations.
Gathering System Regulation
Regulation of gathering facilities may affect certain aspects of Epsilon’s business and the market for Epsilon’s services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC. The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas produced by Epsilon, as well as the revenues received for sales of Epsilon’s natural gas.
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act, or the NGA, and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations.
