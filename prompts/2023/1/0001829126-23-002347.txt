The government is committed to breaking down data silos and sharing urban resources to provide better civil services and security to the general population, which means the “market” for the government’s services is by far the largest in any industry. In the process of a government’s self-transformation, it would be required to undertake massive data management and analysis, massive data connectivity and massive city terminal perception exercises.
 
In general, the government cloud is a platform that serves as the “engine room,” coordinating the technological hardware and software resources used by the government. The cloud provides the government with a platform to engage in comprehensive services such as infrastructure, supporting software, application system, information resources, operation guarantee, and information security. By using cloud technology, the government significantly reduces IT costs, promotes the sharing of information between departments, and improves the speed of launching applications and service quality. The government is also able to accelerate the establishment of smart cities and satisfy the high threshold of data sharing by efficiently processing and managing data.
 
The government cloud algorithm solutions we intend to provide enable the government to improve the efficiency and quality of service of the government cloud platform’s operational efficiency and quality of service, and have exhibited strong market potential.
 
Central processing algorithm services for the manufacturing industry
 
As information technology is ever-increasing intertwined with traditional manufacturing industries, the industrial internet is constantly required to upgrade ICT infrastructure platform, which is a platform for unified communications, to support the application digitalization, networking, and intelligent upgrading of the manufacturing industry and the entire real economy. The integration of information technology and manufacturing also gave rise to new business models such as network collaboration, personalized customization, and service-oriented manufacturing. A variety of machines, devices, and equipment must be embedded with a large number of energy-efficient chips and connected to the network through sensors, embedded controllers, and application systems to form a new complex architecture based on “terminal-cloud” collaboration.

Financial technology is reshaping the way the financial industry work. The transformation of channel and real-time trading scenarios from a centralized system to a fully distributed system demands higher computing power and better energy efficiency ratios. In the next few years, operation analysis scenario will complete the switch from all-in-one to an open architecture, requiring high distributed concurrency. The new smart finance business is the fastest-growing scenario in the future, which requires high concurrency and mobile collaboration. The traditional business scenario is transforming to the cloud, which requires low energy consumption and costs to improve the price-performance ratio of big data comprehensive analysis.
 
Big data finance focuses on the acquisition, storage, processing analysis, and visualization of financial big data. In general, the core technologies of financial big data include the infrastructure layer, the data storage and management layer, the computing processing layer, the data analysis and visualization layer. The data analysis and visualization layer are mainly responsible for simple data analysis, advanced data analysis, and visualization of the relevant analysis results. Big data finance is also committed to the research and development of new financial business models of financing, payment, investment, and information intermediary services by adopting internet technology and information and communications technology. The application scenarios above would benefit from bespoke centralized processing algorithms to improve business efficiency and reduce costs.
