Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Company Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 1, 2021 and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
On March 4, 2021, our sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 5,031,250 shares of Class B common stock (the “founder shares”). The outstanding founder shares included an aggregate of up to 656,250 shares subject to forfeiture by our sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part. The underwriter partially exercised their over-allotment option on August 20, 2021 and forfeited the remainder of the option; thus, 520,875 founder shares were forfeited by our sponsor.
 
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on July 27, 2021. On July 30, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 17,500,000 units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $175,000,000. Each unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“public warrant”). Each public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 7,850,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement (the “private placement warrants”) to our sponsor, Mercury Sponsor Group I LLC, generating gross proceeds of $7,850,000. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants were added to the net proceeds from the initial public offering held in a trust account. If we do not complete a business combination within 36 months from the consummation of the initial public offering, the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law).
 
On August 20, 2021, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option and purchased an additional 541,500 units, generating gross proceeds of $5,415,000.
 
The shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions), and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. Holders of founder shares may also elect to convert their shares of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, subject to adjustment as provided above, at any time.
 
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

PART I
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions (other than amendments relating to provisions governing the election or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination, which require the approval of a majority of at least 90% of the outstanding shares of our common stock voting in a stockholder meeting) cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of 65% of our common stock. Our initial stockholders will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation previously provided that the Company would have until 18 months (i.e. until January 30, 2023), or 24 months (i.e until July 30, 2024) if the Company had signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period, from the closing of its initial public offering to complete a business combination. While the Company had been in discussions with respect to a business combination, the Company’s board of directors did not believe that there would be sufficient time before January 30, 2023 to execute a definitive agreement for an initial business combination or to complete an initial business combination before July 30, 2023 if the Company had executed a definitive agreement by January 30, 2023. As a result, on December 20, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Extension Amendment”), extending the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from January 30, 2023 (or July 30, 2023 if the Company had executed a definitive agreement for a business combination by January 30, 2023) to July 30, 2024 (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”).  The Extension Amendment Proposal was described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement, which was filed with the SEC on November 30, 2022. At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the Extension Amendment Proposal, and on December 20, 2022, the Company filed the Extension Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Extension Amendment extended the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from January 30, 2023 (or July 30, 2023 if the Company had executed a definitive agreement for a business combination by January 30, 2023) to July 30, 2024 (the date that is 36 months from the closing date of the Company’s initial public offering of units).
 
On December 21, 2022, the Company filed an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Name Change Amendment”) to change its corporate name from “Mercury Ecommerce Acquisition Corp.” to “SEP Acquisition Corp.” (the “Company Name Change”). Additionally, the board of directors of the Company amended the Company’s Bylaws to reflect the Company Name Change.
 
As amended, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:
 

• | if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 36 months from the closing of the Company’s initial public offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account (less up to $100,000 of interest released to us to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law;

PART I
 

• | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 36 months from the closing of the Company’s initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we will not complete our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination.
 
Share Redemptions
 
In connection with the Extension Proposal, the Company was required to permit public stockholders to redeem their shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. Of the 18,041,500 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock outstanding, the holders of 16,737,241 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock elected to redeem their shares at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.22. As a result, the Company transferred cash in the amount of $185.0 million to the Trustee, of which approximately $171.1 million was designated to pay such holders who had elected to redeem their shares in connection with the Extension Proposal. As of December 31, 2022, $162.0 million had been paid to the redeeming stockholders and approximately $22.5 million remained in restricted cash, $9.1 million of which was subsequently paid to such holders who elected to redeem their shares. Following the redemptions, the Company had 1,304,259 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock outstanding and approximately $13.3 million remained in the Trust Account (i.e. approximately $10.22 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock).
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

PART I
 
Indemnity
 
Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations.
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 3737 Buffalo Speedway, Suite 1750, Houston, Texas 77098, and our telephone number is (713) 715-6820. Commencing on July 27, 2021, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have four officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
