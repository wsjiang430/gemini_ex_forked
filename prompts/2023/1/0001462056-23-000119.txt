Item 1. Business
We are a leading specialized storage cloud platform, providing businesses and consumers cloud services to store, use, and protect their data in an easy and affordable manner. We provide these cloud services through a purpose-built, web-scale software infrastructure built on commodity hardware. We believe that by substantially reducing the complexity and frustration of storing, using, and protecting data, we can empower customers to focus on their core business operations. Through our blog and culture of transparency, we have built a community of millions of readers and brand advocates. Referrals from our community of brand advocates, combined with our highly efficient and primarily self-serve customer acquisition model and an ecosystem of thousands of partners, have allowed us to attract more than 500,000 customers as of December 31, 2022. These customers use our Storage Cloud platform across more than 175 countries to grow and protect their business data on our over 2.5 exabytes, or 2.5 trillion megabytes, of data storage under management. 
At its founding, Backblaze set out to simplify the process of storing, using, and protecting data. Over the following years we focused relentlessly on cutting away the complexity common among diversified cloud vendors’ services and legacy on-premises system vendors. Today, we believe our solutions are differentiated by their ease of use and affordability. We believe that focusing on storage use cases and promoting an open ecosystem helps position us to integrate well with a broad range of partners. From our straightforward pricing model, to our transparent communication with customers, to the popular and insightful content on our blog—we believe we have established ourselves as an open and trusted provider and partner.
The Backblaze Storage Cloud organizes, safeguards, and keeps over 500 billion files available on demand and is designed to handle much more in the future. Through our purpose-built software that manages our global physical infrastructure, we provide a platform that we believe is durable, scalable, performant, and secure. Our two cloud services that we offer on our Storage Cloud are:
•Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage: Enables customers to store data, developers to build applications, and partners to expand their use cases. The amount of data stored in this cloud service can scale up and down as needed on a pay-as-you-go basis, or can be paid for on a capacity basis for greater predictability, which we refer to as our B2 Reserve offering. This Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) enables use cases including backups, multi-cloud, application storage, and ransomware protection.
•Backblaze Computer Backup: Automatically backs up data from laptops and desktops for businesses and individuals. This cloud backup service offers easily understood flat-rate pricing to continuously back up a virtually unlimited amount of data. This service is offered as a subscription-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and serves use cases including computer backup, ransomware protection, theft and loss protection, and remote access.
Our solutions are designed for individuals and businesses of all sizes and across all industries but have a particularly strong appeal to mid-market organizations (which we define as organizations with 10 to 999 employees) due to their desire for easy-to-use and cost-effective solutions. 
We have a go-to-market model that was primarily built on a self-serve selling motion. Prospective customers find us through a variety of channels including our website, partners, and brand advocates. We have fostered community engagement with content we share on our blog—in 2022 alone, millions of readers consumed content that we shared there. Our free trial and self-serve sign-up processes help convert our blog readers and referrals from our brand advocates into customers, with approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2022 coming from self-serve customers. Our technology, channel, affiliate, and managed service provider (MSP) partners help expand use cases and sales channels and attract customers, thereby increasing usage of our Storage Cloud. In addition to our self-serve selling motion, we have a sales-assisted selling motion to identify opportunities to increase business with existing customers and to assist larger customers in adopting our services. Our sales-assisted selling motion customers are frequently significantly larger in terms of average revenue per customer than our self-serve customers. 
Substantially all of our revenue is recurring in nature. We employ a land-and-expand model that drives additional revenue from existing customers. As customers generate, store, and back up more data, their use of our platform increases, creating natural opportunities for revenue expansion. We can further expand our relationships with our customers when they adopt new features and use cases that lead to increased usage of our platform. Our land-and-expand strategy is evidenced by our overall net revenue retention rate of 113% and 111% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For more 
information about net revenue retention rate and how it is calculated, please see the section titled “Key Business Metrics” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our B2 Cloud Storage revenue grew by 46% during the year ended December 31, 2022 and our Computer Backup cloud service revenue grew by 17% during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Our ecosystem of partners—including technology and developer partners, channel partners, and MSPs—helps us expand our platform in existing and new markets. Our partners leverage our cloud services to provide storage solutions to their customers or our mutual customers and in turn, we are able to expand our use cases and overall reach.
•Technology and Developer Partners. Our platform, alongside the platforms of our technology and developer partners, enables software developers to efficiently build their applications and provides a cloud storage destination for partners whose products require storage to serve their customers. Partners providing software, hardware, and SaaS services to perform backups, synchronize data, manage media, and address other use cases either select our Storage Cloud for the underlying data storage, or offer it as a choice to their customers. 
•Channel Partners. We sell B2 Cloud Storage to resellers at a discounted rate. Resellers then market and sell B2 Cloud Storage individually or as part of broader solutions to businesses and organizations. The channel provides greater access to markets with specialty needs in the purchasing process, like state and local governments and educational institutions.
•Managed Service Providers (MSP). Our platform enables MSP partners to store data for backups, archives, hybrid cloud setups, ransomware protection, and otherwise manage their clients’ data. MSPs provide critical IT solutions for mid-market organizations who often lack the resources to do so themselves. We believe these providers are drawn to our solutions due to our support of the breadth of their offerings, competitive pricing which helps MSPs with their own margin profile, and ease of use. 
The markets addressed by our platform include Public Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) storage as well as Data-Protection-as-a-Service (DPaaS). According to IDC forecasts, the worldwide market for Public Cloud IaaS Storage is expected to grow to $91.0 billion by 2025. Additionally, according to IDC, the worldwide market for DPaaS is expected to grow to $18.4 billion by 2025. We believe our efficient go-to-market and focus on ease of use are particularly suited to selling to and serving the needs of mid-market businesses (defined as businesses and organizations with 10 to 999 employees). According to our analysis of IDC data, mid-market businesses are expected to represent approximately 60% of worldwide IaaS spending throughout the forecast period (2021 to 2025). We believe this ratio serves as a reasonable proxy for spending across both markets. Applying this ratio to the Public Cloud IaaS Storage market yields a mid-market opportunity growing to $54.6 billion in 2025. Applying the same ratio to the DPaaS market yields a mid-market opportunity growing to $11.0 billion by 2025.
Our Platform and Cloud Services
Our Platform: Backblaze Storage Cloud
The Backblaze Storage Cloud provides the core platform for our cloud services and is designed to be durable, available, scalable, secure, performant and predictive. This storage cloud organizes, safeguards, and keeps over 500 billion files available on demand and is designed to handle many more in the future. The key enabler of the Backblaze Storage Cloud is the software that runs it, which contains millions of lines of code that our software engineering team has written and continually improved since our Company’s founding. The ability to manage an ever-larger amount of data across ever-larger hard drives while maintaining data availability and durability continues to be highly complex. This web-scale software layer receives, stores, and delivers data for customers across the globe. Our code achieves this for billions of files under management by intelligently allocating storage locations in line with capacity and demand. Alongside these core processes, the software layer also manages load balancing, caching, data compression, deletion, billing, as well as numerous other essential functions for hundreds of thousands of customers. Generally weekly code updates regularly enhance these functions. 
Our vault architecture creates redundancy for the storage of customer data using proprietary and other algorithms. Our software splits each uploaded customer file into several data parts, adds multiple redundant parts, and stores these parts across discrete hard drives in different servers in a data center. As a result, even if a few of the parts are entirely lost or 
offline, we are able to reconstruct the customer data from the remaining parts for durability. Multiple vaults are grouped together to form one cluster, and one or more clusters are organized into a region. Our globally distributed storage platform also offers customers multi-region geographic choice for their data—currently between East and West Coast regions in the United States and Europe—providing flexibility for different needs including geopolitical considerations, regulatory requirements, and performance optimization.
This software manages our global physical infrastructure of more than 250,000 hard drives and one terabit per second (one million megabits per second) of network capacity across multiple data centers. Our systems also manage the automation, monitoring, and security of this infrastructure. 
As our customers’ data grows, and our total revenue with it, we continuously and smoothly deploy additional infrastructure. A significant amount of our employees are either software engineers that develop and improve the software that runs our Storage Cloud or Cloud Operations employees that specialize in network operations, site reliability engineering, technical operations, and supply chain, which operate our software and systems to deliver our infrastructure as a service and our cloud services. 
Our Cloud Service Offerings
Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage. B2 Cloud Storage provides customers direct access to our Storage Cloud to store, use and protect data. Users can access the platform through industry standard and native application programming interfaces (APIs), software development kits (SDKs), our web interface, or hundreds of third-party integrations. The wide range of options for accessing B2 Cloud Storage allows anyone to use it, including developers and partners who can integrate storage capabilities into their technology stack or build their own solutions on top of our platform. Customers also strategically tier backups of their core data systems to B2 Cloud Storage, including on-premises and virtual machine servers and other high-capacity storage devices. Customers leverage B2 Cloud Storage for a wide range of use cases, including public, hybrid and multi-cloud data storage; application development and DevOps; content delivery and edge computing; security and ransomware protection; media management; backup, archive and tape replacement; repository for analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning; and Internet of Things (e.g., storing data for surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart devices).
Backblaze Computer Backup. Our Computer Backup cloud service backs up laptops, desktops, and external hard drives in a continuous and automated fashion. Whether for home computers or a business’ full fleet of machines, customers can back up a virtually unlimited number of files without size or speed constraints. This cloud service includes a lightweight agent that runs locally on each end user’s computer, continuously searching for new and changed files in a manner unobtrusive to the user. When a new or changed file is detected, the altered data is backed up and sent to the Backblaze Storage Cloud. Once there, it is accessible to the end user or business administrator responsible for managing the account. In the event of data loss, customers can restore all or portions of their backed-up data. Customers leverage Computer Backup for many different use cases, including Mac and PC backup; ransomware protection; theft and loss recovery; data archiving; organization and MSP-level management; and remote access. 
Customers
Our customers consist of a wide range of organizations and businesses—particularly mid-market organizations—and consumers. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 500,000 customers in over 175 countries, including approximately 436,000 customers using our Computer Backup cloud services solution and approximately 87,000 customers using our B2 Cloud Storage solution (approximately 16,000 customers use both our B2 Cloud Storage and Computer Backup solutions). Our customers span a range of industries, including a broad range of businesses, MSPs, developers, media innovators, creative agencies, academic institutions, government agencies, research institutes, gaming companies, and individuals. Our customer base is highly diversified, with no single customer accounting for more than 1% of our total revenue in 2022 or 2021. 
Sales and Marketing
We believe we have an efficient go-to-market model that is built on a self-serve selling motion. Prospective customers find us through a number of channels including our website, partners, and brand advocates. We have fostered community engagement through the content shared on our blog. In addition to generating customers, our content generation efforts have contributed to building a community of thousands of partners. Our technology and developer, channel, and MSP partners expand use cases and attract customers, thereby increasing the usage of our platform. 
Our marketing efforts focus on establishing our brand, generating awareness, creating leads, and cultivating the Backblaze community. The marketing team consists primarily of product marketing, corporate communications and publishing, social media, growth marketing, and website teams. We leverage both online and offline marketing channels such as blogs, events and trade shows, seminars and webinars, whitepapers, case studies, search engines, and email marketing.
We complement our self-serve customer acquisition model with a growing inside sales team that is focused on a low-touch sales assisted model that supports our larger customers if the need arises. Among other things, our sales and marketing teams focus on inbound inquiries, outbound prospecting targeting specific use cases, and volume expansion of our self-serve customers. We have plans to increase our investment in our sales and marketing capabilities to capitalize on our large and global market opportunity. We have also stood up a Developer Evangelism team to support our focus on supporting developers and applications storage use cases, and scaled up our partnerships team to grow our technology and channel partnership opportunity.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development. We have an internal technology roadmap to introduce new features and functionality to our platform. Substantially all of our R&D organization, which makes up approximately one-third of our company, is focused on software development.
We generally have a continuous product release cycle and we typically release updates on a weekly basis. We establish priorities for our organization by collaborating closely with our customers, community, and employees.
Competition
Our current primary competitors generally fall into the following categories: diversified public cloud vendors, such as Amazon.com, Inc. through Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc. through Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Corporation through Azure; certain smaller cloud storage competitors; and legacy on-premises storage vendors such as Dell EMC.
While we compete primarily based on offering services that are significantly easier to use and lower cost, but also through continued innovation; key platform features; availability, durability, scalability, and performance; brand awareness and reputation; transparency; customer support; independence; security; interoperability; partner ecosystem; and capabilities for configurability and APIs, we believe we stand out by offering a substantially easier to use product and significantly lower pricing. 
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology platform and cloud services, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others. While we do not own any patents, we protect our intellectual property through a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names where appropriate. In addition, we control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals, and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us. We own two registered trademarks in the United States for the word Backblaze and the Backblaze logo.
Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our offerings. In addition, while we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, they may be inadequate and can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for violations of such measures. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
We may also be subject to third-party infringement claims from our competitors or non-practicing entities, many of these parties may have more significant resources and funding than we have. For more information regarding risks related to intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Employees and Human Capital 
We believe we have an aligned and engaged workforce with relatively limited employee turnover. As of December 31, 2022, we had 393 full-time employees, including a net of 123 new full-time employees hired during 2022. A significant amount of our employees are based out of our San Mateo, California headquarters. However, since March 2020 and throughout all of 2021, employees generally worked remotely due to the COVID pandemic. Our offices reopened during 2022 and most employees located in proximity to our headquarters office location utilize a hybrid approach which includes a mixture of working in the office and working remotely from home.
Culture is very important at Backblaze and we recognize that employees are our greatest asset. We recognize and value the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion and have a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee that is comprised of a diverse group of employees and management. The committee is committed to cultivating and nurturing an inclusive and diverse environment at Backblaze by providing unique opportunities that will bring forth and promote the variety of cultures, backgrounds and circumstances that make up the Backblaze team while surpassing basic tolerance with awareness, acceptance and action. No employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment by us. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good, as evidenced by our Glassdoor 4.8/5.0 rating, 95% CEO Approval, and 95% Recommend to a Friend ratings as of February 1, 2023.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located in San Mateo, California. We lease data center facilities in California, Arizona, Virginia, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We believe that our properties are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional space in the future, we believe that it would be available on commercially reasonable terms.
