Item 1. Business.
Company Overview 
 
Splash is a portfolio company managing multiple brands across several growth segments within the consumer beverage industry. Splash has built organizational capabilities and an infrastructure enabling it to incubate and/or acquire brands with the intention of efficiently accelerating them to higher volumes. The management team has proven capabilities in building consumer franchises and marketing and distributing multiple brands of beverages within the non-alcoholic and alcoholic segments. Manufacturing is typically outsourced to third party co-packers and distillers, or in select cases for a brand such as Copa Di Vino wines, performed within our own facility in Oregon.
 
We believe the distribution landscape in the beverage industry is changing rapidly as tech-enabled e-commerce business models are thriving. Direct to consumer, office or home solutions are projected to continue to gain traction in the future. To address this opportunity Splash continues to shape its operating model to be vertically integrated building an e-commerce platform, Qplash, which purchases local and regional brands for developing a direct line of sales to small retail stores.
 
Splash’s wholly owned subsidiary, Splash Beverage Group II, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name TapouT Beverages, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring the rights under a license agreement with TapouT, LLC (Authentic Brands Group). Splash has license rights to the TapouT Performance brand in North America (Including US Territories and Military Bases), United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa, Scandinavia, Peru, Colombia, Chile and Guatemala.
 
In addition, Splash has a joint venture with SALT Naturally Flavored Tequila, Copa Di Vino wines and Pulpoloco, sangrias that comes in a biodegradable can.
 
The Company leadership understand the importance of infusing beverage brands with strong pop culture and lifestyle elements which drives trial, belief and, most importantly, repeat purchases.

The management team led by Robert Nistico has over 28 years of experience in all levels of the three-tier distribution system used in the beverage industry working on brands such as Red Bull and companies such as Gallo Winery and RNCC Texas. The President & CMO, Bill Meissner, has led major beverage brands as Sparkling Ice, Fuze, Sweet Leaf Tea and Jones Soda. The CFO, Ron Wall, has over 25 years of experience in the alcohol beverage industry with Diageo and William Grant & Sons. The Senior Vice President of Sales, James Allred, has 25+ years’ experience in the beverage industry predominately with Anheuser-Busch.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to combine the traditional approach of manufacturing, distributing, and marketing of beverages, with early-stage brands that have a reasonable level of pre-existing brand awareness and market presence, or have attributes that we believe to be purely innovative. We believe this allows us to break through the clutter of numerous brand introductions and dilute risk. This philosophy is applied regardless of whether the brand is 100% owned or a joint venture.
 
For acquisition or joint venture consideration, we prefer to work with brands that already have one or more of the following in place:



● | Some level of preexisting brand awareness 
--+----------------------------------------------


● | Regional presence that can be expanded 
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Licensing an existing brand name (TapouT for example) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Add to an underdeveloped and/or growing category capitalizing on consumer trends 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Innovation to an existing attractive category (such as flavored tequila) 
● | A near term clear path to profitability 



We believe this model provides us with two paths to success: one, developing our wholly owned core brands and two, the ability to tap into high growth, early-stage brands ready to scale. This platform allows us to significantly reduce development expense while simultaneously increasing efficiencies for all brands in our portfolio.
 
Our management team has over 120 years of combined experience in the beverage industry, including decades of successful brand introductions by our management team (Gallo, Red Bull, Bacardi, Diageo, Sparkling Ice, Jones Soda, FUZE Beverage, NOS Energy, SoBe Beverages, Muscle Milk, Marley Beverages), we believe our ability to break through the distribution and retail bottlenecks makes us an attractive joint venture partner to many new brand owners.
 
Splash has the ability to fully own a brand or be flexible to engage in business ventures structured with a revenue split, or an equity position.
 
The benefit to Splash in these shared brand ownerships is the ability to avoid the development costs for new products. This model spreads our risk over several brands, contributes to our economies of scale, and improves our relationship with distributors and reduces the overall cost of infrastructure.
 
The Company also believe the distribution landscape in the beverage category is changing rapidly. Tech-enabled business models are thriving and direct to consumer, office or home solutions are projected to continue to gain traction as beverage alcohol regulations evolve. A core strategy for us is to build onto the early success we’re seeing with the Qplash online platform, our consumer-packaged goods retail division and our first entry point into the growing e-commerce channel.

Manufacturing and Co-packing
 
We are responsible for the manufacturing of Copa di Vino, TapouT Performance and SALT. The Copa di Vino product line is bottled at our manufacturing facility in The Dalles, Oregon. Pulpoloco is imported from Spain as a finished product.
 
Although we are responsible for manufacturing TapouT Performance and SALT, we do not directly manufacture these products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to third party bottlers and contract packers.
 
Our TapouT Performance and Salt products are manufactured in the United States and Mexico under separate arrangements with each party. Our co-packaging arrangements are terminable upon request and do not obligate us to produce any minimum quantities of products within specified periods.
 
We purchase concentrates, flavors, dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, and other components and ingredients for our beverage products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our manufacturing operations and various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our formulas.
 
Distribution
 
We operate within what is referred to as a “Three Tier Distribution System” where manufacturers do not typically sell directly to retailers, but instead contract for local and regional distribution with independent distributors. These distributors typically have geographic rights to distribute major beverage brands and call on every store in a given area such as major cities or regions. Our management team has extensive experience working within this channel and believes that we will be successful in building a strong network of these distributors.
 
In addition to working with these independent distributors, we also have distribution arrangements with national retail accounts to distribute some of our products directly through their warehouse operations. Most notably, SBG executed a distribution agreement with AB-InBev, for distribution with their owned operations, AB ONE. This provides SBG very effective distribution capabilities.
 
Employees
 
 We have 40 full-time employees, including non-officer employees and our executive officers. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Listing on the NYSE American
 
Our common stock and warrants are listed on the NYSE American exchange under the ticker symbols “SBEV” and “SBEV WT,” respectively.
