Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 We are a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. On December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a business combination agreement with QT Imaging, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“QT Imaging”), a medical device company engaged in the research, development and commercialization of innovative body imaging systems using low energy sound, for the Company’s initial business combination. Upon consummation of the business combination with QT Imaging, we expect to change our name and be known as QT Imaging Holdings, Inc.
 We seek to capitalize on the significant experience and contacts of our management team to complete our initial business combination. We believe our management team’s distinctive background and record of acquisition and operational success could have a transformative impact on verified target businesses.
 Our management team has significant hands-on experience helping companies optimize their existing and new growth initiatives. We intend to apply a unique “Mentor-Investor” philosophy to partner with QT Imaging where we will offer financial, operational and executive mentoring in order to accelerate its growth and development from a privately held entity to a publicly traded company. Further, we intend to share best practices and key learnings, gathered from our management team’s operating and investing experience, as well as strong relationships in the advanced medical equipment industries to help shape corporate strategies. Additionally, our management team has operated and invested in leading global advanced medical equipment companies across their corporate life cycles, and has developed deep relationships with key large multi-national organizations and investors. We believe that these relationships and our management team’s know-how present a significant opportunity to help drive strategic dialogue, access new customer relationships and achieve global ambitions following the completion of our initial business combination. We believe that we are providing an interesting alternative investment opportunity that capitalizes on key trends impacting the capital markets for advanced medical equipment companies.
 Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from our management team’s operational expertise. Our selection process leverages our management team’s broad and deep relationship network and unique technology, media and telecommunications (“TMT”), aerospace and defense (“A&D”), advanced medical equipment, intelligent automation and sustainable industries expertise, including proven deal-sourcing and structuring capabilities, to provide us with a multitude of business combination opportunities. Our management team has experience:

Business Combination
 As set forth below and in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) dated December 12, 2022, the Company executed a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), dated as of December 8, 2022, with QTI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital5 (“Merger Sub”), and QT Imaging (the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”). Consistent with our strategy, we have identified and used general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating the target’s business, and we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, documenting reviews and inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial and other information.
The Merger
 Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into QT Imaging (the “Merger”), with QT Imaging as the surviving company in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”), and after giving effect to the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of GigCapital5, which will be renamed as QT Imaging Holdings, Inc. (“QTI Holdings” or the “Combined Company”).
 Subject to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of the common stock of QT Imaging, par value $0.001 per share (the “QT Imaging Common Stock”) (excluding each share of QT Imaging Common Stock held in the treasury of QT Imaging which will be cancelled without any conversion of such shares of QT Imaging Common Stock held in the treasury and dissenting shares) will be automatically cancelled and converted into (A) the right to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of GigCapital5 (the “GigCapital5 Common Stock”) calculated based on the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and (B) the contingent right to receive a portion of additional shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock based on the performance of the Combined Company if certain requirements are achieved in accordance with the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, if, as and when payable. The “Exchange Ratio” means the quotient of (a) the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) divided by (b) the QT Imaging Fully Diluted Capital Stock (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement). In addition, at the Effective Time, certain warrants of QT Imaging to purchase QT Imaging Common Stock will be converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share.
 The GigCapital5 public units, each comprised of one share of GigCapital5 Common Stock and one GigCapital5 warrant to purchase shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock, are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbols “GIA.U,” “GIA” and “GIA.WS,” respectively. We intend to apply for listing of the common stock of the Combined Company and the warrants of the Combined Company on the NYSE under the symbols “QTI” and “QTI.WS,” respectively, upon the closing.
 At the Effective Time, each outstanding in-the-money QT Imaging warrant that is not exercised and exchanged prior to the Effective Time will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder of an in-the-money QT Imaging warrant, in accordance with the provisions of an in-the-money QT Imaging warrant, be converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (each such resulting warrant, an “Assumed Warrant”). Each Assumed Warrant will be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such corresponding in-the-money QT Imaging warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (including applicable vesting conditions), except to the extent such terms or conditions are rendered 
 3


inoperative by the transactions. Accordingly, as of the Effective Time: (A) each such Assumed Warrant will be exercisable solely for shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock subject to each Assumed Warrant will be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such in-the-money QT Imaging warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the per share merger consideration, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the GigCapital5 Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Assumed Warrant will be determined by dividing the per share exercise price for the shares of company common stock subject to the in-the-money QT Imaging warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the per share merger consideration, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) the holder of each in-the-money QT Imaging warrant outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to the contingent right to receive a portion of the merger consideration earnout shares, if, as and when payable. At the Effective Time, each company warrant (other than any in-the-money QT Imaging warrant) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, in accordance with the provisions of such company warrant (for the avoidance of doubt, as may be amended following the date of this current report with the written approval of GigCapital5), be canceled without any conversion of such company warrant and no payment or distribution will be made, and the holder of such company warrant will cease to have any rights, with respect to such company warrant.
 Further, prior to the Effective Time, QT Imaging will, in a manner acceptable to GigCapital5, take such actions as are necessary to terminate each QT Imaging option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, including by payment or in accordance with the terms of the QT Imaging option plan, the company options will be terminated without any conversion of such company options and no payment or distribution will be made, and the holder of any company options will cease to have any rights, with respect to such company options.
 At the Effective Time, the board of directors of QT Imaging Holdings (the “QTI Holdings Board”) will consist of seven directors in a classified board of directors with three classes, the initial members of which (the “Initial Post-Closing QTI Holdings Directors”) will consist of three individuals identified by GigCapital5 who will serve either in Class I or Class III, and will include the chairman of the QTI Holdings Board, and four individuals identified by QT Imaging who will serve in either Class I, Class II or Class III, and will include the Chief Executive Officer of QT Imaging.
 Incentive Plans
 In connection with the Merger, the parties will cooperate to establish, prior to the Effective Time an equity incentive award plan (the “Equity Plan”) for QTI Holdings with an award pool of GigCapital5 Common Stock equal to (i) eleven percent of the fully diluted shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock outstanding as of immediately after the Effective Time (rounded up to the nearest whole share) (the “Initial Equity Plan Pool”), which Equity Plan will include an “evergreen” provision pursuant to which such award pool will automatically increase on each January 1st that occurs within the ten year period following stockholder approval of such plan by an amount equal to five percent of the shares of GigCapital5 Common Stock outstanding as of 12:01 a.m. (Pacific Time) on such date, and which Equity Plan will be effective at and after the Effective Time. The parties expect that up to twenty-five percent of the Initial Equity Plan Pool would be reserved for issuance of awards by QTI Holdings to individuals who were employees or other service providers of QT Imaging as of the Effective Time and remain continuously employed or engaged by QTI Holdings at the time of the issuance of such awards following the Effective Time.
Approval of Extensions
 The Company’s offering prospectus and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provided that the Company initially had until September 28, 2022 (the date which was 12 months after the consummation of the initial public offering (the “Offering”) to complete its initial business combination. On September 23, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “September 2022 Special Meeting”) and the Company’s stockholders approved the following proposals: (i) a proposal to amend (the “September 2022 Charter Amendment”) the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation giving the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time, from September 28, 2022 to March 28, 2023 (i.e., for a period of time ending 18 months from the consummation of its Offering) and (ii) a proposal to amend the Company’s investment management trust 
 4


agreement, dated as of September 23, 2021 (the “September 2022 Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, allowing the Company to extend the Combination Period six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time from September 28, 2022 to March 28, 2023 by depositing into the trust account for each one-month extension $160,000. The purpose of the September 2022 Charter Amendment and the September 2022 Trust Amendment is to allow the Company more time to complete its initial business combination. In connection with the September 2022 Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders elected to redeem 18,985,950 shares of the Company’s common stock, which represented approximately 82.5% of the shares that were part of the public units sold in the Offering. Following such redemptions, $192,138,312 was withdrawn from the trust account on September 27, 2022.
 On March 28, 2023, the Company held a second special meeting of its stockholders (the “March 2023 Special Meeting”) and the Company’s stockholders approved the following proposals: (i) a proposal to amend (the “March 2023 Charter Amendment”) the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation giving the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time, from March 28, 2023 to September 28, 2023 (i.e., for a period of time ending 24 months from the consummation of its initial public offering and (ii) a proposal to amend the Company’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of September 23, 2021 (the “March 2023 Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, allowing the Company to extend the Combination Period six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time from March 28, 2023 to September 28, 2023 by depositing $100,000 into the trust account for each one-month extension. The purpose of the March 2023 Charter Amendment and the March 2023 Trust Amendment is to allow the Company more time to complete its initial business combination. In connection with the March 2023 Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders elected to redeem 995,049 shares of the Company’s common stock, which represented approximately 4.3% of the shares that were part of the public units sold in the Offering. Following such redemptions, $10,449,626 is being withdrawn from the trust account.
 First Extension
 On September 26, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured, non-interest-bearing promissory note (the “Extension Note”) to the Sponsor for a principal amount of $160,000. The proceeds from the Extension Note were deposited into the trust account in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Extension Note matures on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination or the date the Company winds up and may be prepaid without penalty. 
Second Extension
 On October 26, 2022, the Company further amended and restated the Extension Note (the “First Restated Extension Note”) to reflect an additional principal amount of $160,000 for a collective principal amount under the First Restated Extension Note of $320,000. The Sponsor deposited such funds into the Company’s trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
Third Extension
 On November 28, 2022, the Company further amended and restated the First Restated Extension Note (the “Second Restated Extension Note”) to reflect an additional principal amount of $160,000 for a collective principal amount under the Second Restated Extension Note of $480,000. The Sponsor deposited such funds into the Company’s trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
Fourth Extension
 On December 27, 2022, the Company further amended and restated the Second Restated Extension Note (the “Third Restated Extension Note”) to reflect an additional principal amount of $160,000 for a collective principal amount under the Third Restated Extension Note of $640,000. The Sponsor deposited the additional principal amount of $160,000 into the Company’s trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
Fifth Extension
 On January 26, 2023, the Company further amended and restated the Third Restated Extension Note (the “Fourth 
 5


Restated Extension Note”) to reflect an additional principal amount of $160,000 for a collective principal amount under the Fourth Restated Extension Note of $800,000. The Sponsor deposited the additional principal amount of $160,000 into the Company’s trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
Sixth Extension
 On February 27, 2023, the Company further amended and restated the Fourth Restated Extension Note (the “Fifth Restated Extension Note”) to reflect an additional principal amount of $160,000 for a collective principal amount under the Fifth Restated Extension Note of $960,000. The Sponsor deposited the additional principal amount of $160,000 into the Company’s trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
Seventh Extension
 On March 28, 2023, following the approval of the March 2023 Charter Amendment and the March 2023 Trust Amendment, the Company further amended and restated the Fifth Restated Extension Note (the “Sixth Restated Extension Note”) to reflect an additional principal amount of $100,000 for a collective principal amount under the Sixth Restated Extension Note of $1,060,000. The Sponsor deposited the additional principal amount of $100,000 into the Company’s trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
Working Capital Loans
 On September 26, 2022, the Company issued a convertible, non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note (the “Working Capital Note”) to the Sponsor for a principal amount of $65,000. The Working Capital Note was subsequently amended and restated six more times on October 26, 2022 (an additional $65,000 added to the Working Capital Note), November 28, 2022 (an additional $65,000 added to the Working Capital Note), December 27, 2022 (an additional $65,000 added to the Working Capital Note), January 25, 2023 (an additional $65,000 added to the Working Capital Note), February 27, 2023 (an additional $350,000 added to the Working Capital Note) and March 28, 2023 (an additional $130,000 added to the Working Capital Note), respectively, for a collective principal amount of $805,000. The Working Capital Note was issued to provide the Company with additional working capital during the Extension and was not deposited into the Trust Account. The Working Capital Note is convertible at the Sponsor’s election upon the consummation of the initial business combination. Upon such election, the convertible note will convert, at a price of $10.00 per unit, into units identical to the Private Placement Units issued in connection with the Offering. An aggregate of 80,500 Private Placement Units of the Company would be issued if the entire principal balance of the Working Capital Note is converted. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one redeemable warrant. The warrants constituting a part of the Private Placement Units would be exercisable, subject to the terms and conditions of the warrant and during the exercise period as provided in the warrant agreement governing the warrants. The Company has relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, in connection with the issuance and sale of the convertible promissory note, as it was issued to a sophisticated investor without a view to distribution and was not issued through any general solicitation or advertisement.
 PIPE Subscription Agreement
 Prior to the Effective Time, GigCapital5 may enter into agreements with investors (the private investment in public equity (the "PIPE") and “PIPE Investors”) for the subscription for GigCapital5 Common Stock, convertible promissory notes or other securities or any combination of such securities to be subscribed for pursuant to the terms of one or more subscription agreements (all such subscription agreements, collectively the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) on terms and conditions mutually agreeable to GigCapital5 and QT Imaging (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided that, unless otherwise agreed to, the aggregate gross proceeds under the PIPE Subscription Agreements will target $26,000,000 (the “PIPE Investment Amount”). As of the date of this Annual Report, there are no PIPE Subscription Agreements in place. The consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the receipt of the requisite approval of the stockholders of each of GigCapital5 and QT Imaging, and the fulfillment of certain other conditions, as described in greater detail this Form 10-K.
Lack of Business Diversification
 For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our 
 6


success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

▪ | Subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Business Combination
 In connection with any proposed Business Combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein.
 We will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, provided that we may also decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
 Under the rules of the NYSE, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
  
▪ | We issue (other than in a public offering for cash) a number of shares of common stock that would either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Any of our management team or substantial security holders (as defined by the rules of the NYSE) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our management team or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The issuance or potential issuance of shares of our common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The proposed Business Combination with QT Imaging will be required by the above-referenced rules to be approved by our stockholders at a meeting called for such purpose. Approval of the proposed Business Combination will require the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon and actually cast at the stockholders’ meeting, voting as a single class. The Sponsor is entitled to vote an aggregate of 6,530,000 shares of our common stock, which constitutes a majority of our common stock. Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement with the Company and QT Imaging, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed, at any meeting of our stockholders and in connection with any action by written consent of our stockholders, to (i) appear or cause all shares or other voting securities of us that it holds, owns, or is entitled to vote, whether as shares or as a constituent part of a unit of securities to be counted present for quorum purposes, (ii) vote (or execute an action by written consent) or cause to be voted (A) in favor of the Business Combination Agreement, the Merger, and any other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, (B) against any action, agreement or transaction or proposal that would result in a breach of the Business Combination Agreement or that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure to consummate the Merger, (C) in favor of the proposals and any other matters necessary or reasonably requested by us for the consummation of the proposed Business Combination, (D) against any business combination proposal other than with QT Imaging and any other action that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, 
 7


delay, or adversely affect the proposed Business Combination or result in a breach of any obligation or agreement of the Sponsor contained in the Sponsor Support Agreement. 
 If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
  
▪ | the timing of the proposed transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place us at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on us;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


▪ | the risk that our stockholders would fail to approve the initial business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | other time and budget constraints; and
--+---------------------------------------


▪ | potential additional legal complexities of an initial business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combination and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC, which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are voted at a stockholder meeting held to consider the initial business combination.
 We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until after September 28, 2023 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 Redemption Rights
 At the meeting called to approve our initial business combination, public stockholders (but not our Founders or management team) may seek to redeem their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, by converting such shares into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid (which taxes may be paid only from the interest earned on the funds in the trust account). Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders (but not our Founder or management team) with the opportunity to sell their shares of common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 We may also require public stockholders seeking redemption, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s (“DTC”) DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) 
 8


System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the proposed Business Combination.
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. This fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to do so prior to the time that we know that the proposed Business Combination will be consummated. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. Thus, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed Business Combination and the proposed Business Combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the time designated in the proxy statement to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his, her or its redemption rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he, she or it is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his, her or its broker and requesting delivery of his, her or its shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “We will require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
 The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect redemption rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his, her or its redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him, her or it to deliver his, her or its certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he, she or it could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his, her or its shares in the open market before actually delivering his, her or its shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered his, her or its certificate or shares. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his, her or its shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his, her or its certificate or shares in connection with an election of such shares’ redemption and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he, she or it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate or shares (physically or electronically).
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public holders. Furthermore, if our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights will not be entitled to convert their shares into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, as applicable. We will thereafter promptly return any shares delivered by public stockholders. In such case, public stockholders may only share in the assets of the trust account upon our liquidation. This may result in public

stockholders receiving less than they would have received if our initial business combination was completed and they had exercised redemption rights in connection therewith due to potential claims of creditors. If we would be left with less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets as a result of the holders of public shares properly demanding redemption of their shares, we will likely be unable to consummate an initial business combination.
 Liquidation if No Business Combination
 If we have not completed an initial business combination by the date required by our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and net of interest that may be used to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board of Directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 Our Founder and management team have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares of common stock to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by September 28, 2023; provided that at the beginning of each one-month extension, our Sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into the trust account $160,000 for each one-month extension through February 28, 2023 and $100,000 thereafter for each one-month extension of the time period to complete our initial business combination, in each case, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Founders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 Under the Delaware General Corporation law (“DGCL”), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90‑day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. However, if we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will proceed as provided for in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as described above. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the expiration of the time periods described above and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the procedures required by Section 280 of the DGCL, which would limit the amount and duration of our stockholders’ liability with respect to liquidating distributions as described above. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of 
 10


distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than ten business days to effectuate such distribution. Our Founders and management team have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the Founder Shares and the shares of common stock underlying the Private Placement Units. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we are permitted to withdraw to pay such expenses.
 If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.37 in principal plus accrued interest net of franchise and income taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us redeem or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as described elsewhere herein. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 Our Founder, management team and the underwriters will not participate in any redemption distribution from our trust account with respect to their Founder Shares, Insider Shares and Private Placement Units. Additionally, any loans made by our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates for working capital needs will be forgiven and not repaid if we are unable to complete an initial business combination.
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot make any assurance of the amount we will be able to return to our public stockholders.
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after September 28, 2023; provided that at the beginning of each one-month extension, our Sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into the trust account $160,000 for each one-month extension through February 28, 2023 and $100,000 thereafter for each one-month extension of the time period to complete our initial business combination, (in each case, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note), this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of at least a majority of our outstanding common stock. If we seek to amend any provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by September 28, 2023; provided that at the beginning of each one-month extension, our Sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into the trust account $160,000 for each one-month extension through February 28, 2023 and $100,000 thereafter for each one-month extension of the time period to complete our initial business combination, (in each case, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note), we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Founders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our Founders and management team have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to any common stock held by them, including any public shares they may hold, in connection with any vote to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Specifically, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, among other things, that:

▪ | We shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the shares of common stock voted at a stockholder meeting are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If our initial business combination is not consummated by September 28, 2023; provided that at the beginning of each one-month extension, our Sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into the trust account $160,000 for each one-month extension through February 28, 2023 and $100,000 thereafter for each one-month extension of the time period to complete our initial business combination, in each case, (in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note), then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve the Company;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The proceeds from our Offering, including such proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, shall be placed into the trust account; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 We expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including private equity groups, venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Therefore, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
  
▪ | Our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12



 
▪ | Our outstanding warrants and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 Employees
 We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”). We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
