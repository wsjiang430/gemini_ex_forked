Customers may visit us in person at any of our retail stores located primarily in shopping malls and open-air centers throughout the southwest, southeast and midwest regions of the United States. Our customers may also visit us online at our e-Commerce site, dillards.com, gaining company-wide access to in-store merchandise selections across 29 states as well as in our fulfillment and distribution centers. Customers also have the option to buy online and pickup in store or have their orders shipped directly to their desired location. Dillards.com also serves as a key customer engagement tool with continually updated style and trend content to both educate and inspire our customers.
Our retail merchandise business is conducted under highly competitive conditions. Although we are a large regional department store, we have numerous competitors at the national and local level that compete with our individual stores, including specialty, off-price, discount and Internet retailers. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, operating efficiency, service and credit availability. We believe that our stores are in a strong competitive position with regard to each of these factors. Other retailers may compete for customers on some or all of these factors, or on other factors, and may be perceived by some potential customers as being better aligned with their particular preferences.
Our merchandise selections include, but are not limited to, our lines of exclusive brand merchandise such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & Yorke and Daniel Cremieux. Our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program provides benefits for Dillard’s and our customers. Our customers receive fashionable, higher quality product often at a savings compared to national brands. Our private label merchandise program allows us to ensure the Company’s high standards are achieved, while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers.

We have made a significant investment in our trademark and license portfolio, in terms of design function, advertising, quality control and quick response to market trends in a quality manufacturing environment. Dillard’s trademark registrations are maintained for as long as Dillard’s holds the exclusive right to use the trademarks on the listed products.
Our merchandising, sales promotion and store operating support functions are conducted primarily at our corporate headquarters. Our back office sales support functions, such as accounting, product development, store planning and information technology, are also centralized.
We have developed a knowledge of each of our trade areas and customer bases for our stores. This knowledge is enhanced through regular store visits by senior management and merchandising personnel and through the use of online merchandise information and is supported by our regional merchandising offices. We will continue to use existing technology and research to edit merchandise assortments by store to meet the specific preference, taste and size requirements of each local operating area.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) owns and manages Dillard’s private label credit cards, including credit cards co-branded with American Express (collectively “private label cards”) under a long-term marketing and servicing alliance (“Wells Fargo Alliance”). Under the Wells Fargo Alliance, Wells Fargo establishes and owns private label card accounts for our customers, retains the benefits and risks associated with the ownership of the accounts, provides key customer service functions, including new account openings, transaction authorization, billing adjustments and customer inquiries, receives the finance charge income and incurs the bad debts associated with those accounts. Pursuant to the Wells Fargo Alliance, we receive on-going cash compensation from Wells Fargo based upon the portfolio’s earnings. The compensation received from the portfolio is determined monthly and has no recourse provisions. We participate in the marketing of the private label cards, which includes the cost of customer reward programs. The Wells Fargo Alliance expires in November 2024.
We seek to expand the number and use of the private label cards by, among other things, providing incentives to sales associates to open new credit accounts, which generally can be opened while a customer is visiting one of our stores or online. Customers who open accounts are rewarded with discounts on future purchases. Private label card customers are sometimes offered private shopping nights, special discounts and advance notice of sale events. Wells Fargo administers the loyalty program that rewards customers for private label card usage.
Our earnings depend to a significant extent on the results of operations for the last quarter of our fiscal year. Due to holiday buying patterns, sales for that period average approximately one-third of annual sales. Additionally, working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, increasing during the second half of the year in anticipation of the holiday season.
We purchase merchandise from many sources and do not believe that we are dependent on any one supplier. We have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, but we consider our relationships to be strong and mutually beneficial.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31 of each year. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively, and contained 52 weeks each.

advertising and back office personnel. Given the breadth of our employee base, we tailor our human capital management efforts with a view to specific associate populations.
Of the Company’s full-time associates, approximately 86% work in the retail stores. We focus on attracting and retaining excellent associates at the store level by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market.
Training and talent development. The Company develops talent by investing in both formalized classroom training, specialized training for our sales management team, ongoing mentorship programs and on-the-job experience. We seek to create an engaged workforce through open door policies and promotion opportunities. The Company’s philosophy is to develop talent and promote from within our organization, thus providing a better customer service model due to a deeper understanding of the overall business and our customers’ expectations. Career paths and opportunities for promotion are discussed with associates from the first day of training and on an ongoing basis. As of December 24, 2022, approximately 72% of the salaried managers at our stores were promoted from hourly store positions.
Diversity and inclusion. The Company has a diverse customer base and seeks to achieve that same diversity in its workforce. As of December 24, 2022, approximately 75% of our store associates were women, and approximately 54% of our store associates were non-white.
In its efforts to promote diversity within our store positions, the Company has developed and made available to store level hiring managers a Diversity and Inclusion training curriculum. In addition, in order to ensure that all qualified candidates are aware of store promotion opportunities, each store posts promotion opportunities for supervisory positions.
