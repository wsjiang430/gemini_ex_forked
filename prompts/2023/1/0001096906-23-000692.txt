ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Beyond Commerce, Inc. was formed as a Nevada corporation on January 12, 2006. 

We are focused on business combinations of “big data” companies in global B2B internet marketing analytics, technologies and services. The Company’s objective is to develop and deploy disruptive strategic software technology that will build on organic growth potential and to exploit cross-selling opportunities. We plan to offer a cohesive global digital product and services platform to provide clients with a single point of contact for their big data, marketing and related sales initiatives. We believe our business model will ensure that information will remain secure and private, as necessitated by the current market climate.

In addition, we provide solutions which facilitate the exchange of information and data transactions between supply chain participants, such as manufacturers, retailers, distributors and financial institutions, with the ultimate goal of automating potential client internal processes thereby increasing productivity and lowering costs. We plan to develop proprietary algorithms which it will embed in the planned software to enable clients to access data and gain insight into their business, through that data, leading to improved internal decision making.

The Company currently owns and operates a data company and is actively seeking acquisition opportunities in high growth sectors such as psychedelics, cryptocurrency, ESports and Logistics among others. The Company’s strategy is to identify companies in the early stages of development or growth, acquire them and provide these companies capital in order to accelerate their development and growth with the intention to ultimately sell these companies

Corporate History and Background

Beyond Commerce was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on, January 12, 2006, under the name “Reel Estate Services, Inc.” for the purposes of operating as a media hub for high traffic web properties, utilizing social networking and e-commerce. 

In 2017, the Company reevaluated the commercial viability of its previous operations of all of the aforementioned subsidiaries and determined that many of these businesses were no longer viable. The Company discontinued the operations of the aforementioned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. 

On April 27, 2017, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders where the stockholders approved and ratified, among other things: (i) the reinstatement of Beyond Commerce with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and the appointment of Mr. George Pursglove as sole director; and (ii) the exchange of a portion of the July Judgment against Beyond Commerce into shares of common stock of the Company 

On May 1, 2017, the Company issued Mr. George Pursglove 1,556,632 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, reducing the July Judgment by $12,453. On the same date, the Company authorized the designation of its “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). 

Effective July 27, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, pursuant to which it designated the Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of common stock. In addition, each share of Series A Preferred Stock entitles its holder to (i) cumulative, non-participating dividends in preference and priority to any declaration or payment of a dividend on any of the Company’s common stock, at a rate of 12% per annum, and (ii) three times (3x) voting preference over common stock. On the same date, the Company issued 250,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Pursglove, further reducing the award under the July Judgment owed to Mr. Pursglove by $250,000.

Products and Services Overview

Our goal is to help companies and organizations derive value from their information. To do this, we intend to offer services and solutions such as Content Services, Business Process Management, Customer Experience Management, Discovery, Business Network, and Analytics. 

With our planned products and services, we plan to deliver our customers the following:

(vi) | Increased revenue streams with the enablement of easy expansion across new channels and, ultimately, new markets. 

Content Services

We plan to facilitate content services with an integrated set of technologies to allow customers to manage information throughout the content services lifecycle and improve business productivity, all while mitigating the risk and controlling the costs of growing volumes of data. We intend to make our content services solutions available via on-premise, SaaS and increasingly cloud-based solutions, which will include next-generation SaaS platform for content services. The proposed SaaS platform will be comprised of a set of consumer-grade end-user productivity applications that enable users to access, share, create and collaborate on content, across any device.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Digital Asset Management, which we believe will provide a set of content management services for browsing, searching, viewing, assembling, and delivering rich media content such as images, audio and video. 
· | Customer Communications Management Software, which we believe will make it possible for organizations to process and deliver highly personalized documents in paper or electronic format rather than a “one message fits all” approach. 
· | Social Software, which we believe will help companies “socialize” their web presence by adding blogs, wikis, ratings and reviews, and build communities for public websites and employee intranets.

BYOC Analytics

We believe our proposed BYOC Analytics solutions in which we plan to develop will help organizations gain insight from their structured and unstructured data, make predictions, visualize and report on business processes, customer interactions and a myriad of other sources of information. This analytical data can then be used to refine business processes or content utilization, make predictions, identify trends, improve customer service or be applied in a multitude of different scenarios.

Our Business Strategy

Growth

We plan to grow our business and strengthen our future service offerings in the IMT&S market through product development strategic acquisitions and integration. We plan to be a value-oriented and disciplined acquirer. Currently we are in the process of identifying potential acquisitions of companies in the IMT&S markets. In this regard, on December 14, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Service 800 and the sole shareholder of Service 800 (the “Shareholder”), and on March 4, 2019 we purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Service 800 from the Shareholder (the “Transaction”). Service 800 operates as a premium provider of Customer Feedback Management Platforms to their Fortune 500 and 1000 clients on a global basis. Service 800 provides survey authoring, response rates, feedback types and data analysis on their proprietary, cloud based, automated and centralized platform. Service 800 has currently 21 full time employees that provide services to 130 companies and 300 service organizations. Service 800’s current operations and strategic business plan is to further develop its marketing and Customer Experience platform to use within the framework of its current Fortune 500 and 1000 clients. While acquiring companies that operate complementary businesses will be one of our leading growth drivers, our growth strategy also includes product and software innovation. We plan to create sustained value by expanding distribution and adding value through up-selling and cross-selling across our planned multiple proprietary marketing platforms to our future customers. 

We plan on acquiring operating companies that will help us provide a well-rounded product line to our future customers. We believe that such acquisitions will be our primary driver to growth, similar to high-performing conglomerates. By focusing on these acquisitions and the integration of niche businesses, we believe this will be well-positioned to create a streamlined platform, which we believe will allow us to offer our future clients a full suite of software solutions and technology services. 

We have developed a philosophy, which we refer to as “The Beyond Commerce Business System.” Our philosophy is designed to create value by leveraging a clear set of operational mandates for integrating newly acquired companies and assets. We believe we have the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business given the background and experience of our Chief Executive Officer and the members of our Board of Directors. We believe pursuing strategic acquisitions is an important aspect to our planned strategy. However, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in consummating such acquisitions or that we will be successful in realizing anticipated strategic benefits of such acquisitions.

Funding Agreements

On February 12, 2019, after effectiveness of our registration statement we entered into the second tranche of funding from the Discover Growth Fund, LLC for $2,000,000 of which funds were utilized in the cash component of the Service 800, Inc transaction.

Potential Product Revenues

Our forecasted business will consist of four revenue streams: (1) software license; (2) cloud services and subscriptions; (3) customer support; and (4) professional services. 

License

Our forecasted license revenues will consist of fees earned from the licensing of software products to our future customers. We believe that license revenues will be impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our future software offerings, and our potential acquisitions. A potential customer’s decision to license our software products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer’s network or networks and the licensing and implementation of our planned software products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers.
Cloud Services and Subscriptions

Our forecasted cloud-based services and subscription revenues will consist of (i) software as a service offerings, (ii) managed service arrangements and (iii) subscription revenues relating to on-premise offerings. We believe these offerings will allow our potential customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure.

In addition, we plan to offer B2B integration solutions, such as messaging services, and managed services. Messaging services will (i) allow for the automated and reliable exchange of electronic transaction information, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipment notices and other business documents, among businesses worldwide, and (ii) provide an end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solution to our customers, including program implementation, operational management, and customer support. We believe these planned services will enable customers to effectively manage the flow of electronic transaction information with their trading partners and reduce the complexity of disparate standards and communication protocols.

Customer Support

We plan on integrating our proposed customer support offering to customers together with the purchase of a license of our future enterprise information management software products. This customer support will typically renew on an annual basis; customer support revenues will be a sizeable portion of total revenue, as they are with many of our competitors. Through our planned customer support programs, customers will receive access to software upgrades, a knowledge base, discussions, product information, and an online mechanism to post and review trouble issues. Additionally, our planned customer support teams will handle questions on the use, configuration, and functionality of our products and can help identify software issues, develop solutions, and document enhancement requests for consideration in future product releases.

10

Professional Service and Other

We plan to provide consulting and learning services to customers and generally these services will relate to the implementation, training and integration of our licensed product offerings into the customer’s systems.

We believe our planned consulting services will help customers build solutions that will enable them to leverage their investments in our technology and in existing enterprise systems. Implementation of these services will range from simple modifications to meet specific departmental needs to enterprise applications that will integrate with multiple existing systems.

We plan to have our learning services advisors analyze our future customers’ education and training needs, focusing on key learning outcomes and timelines, with a view to creating an appropriate education plan for the employees of our customers who work with our products. We plan to design flexible education plans that can be applied to any phase of implementation: pilot, roll-out, upgrade or refresher. Our learning services will employ a blended approach by combining mentoring, instructor-led courses, webinars, eLearning and potentially, focused workshops.

Potential Acquisitions 

We believe our future competitive position in the marketplace will be dependent upon our ability to maintain a complex and evolving array of technologies, products, services and capabilities. Considering the continually evolving marketplace in which we intend to operate, we plan to regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the IMT&S market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.

Pursuing strategic acquisitions is an important aspect to our current and future growth strategy, which we expect to continue, in order to strengthen our service offerings in the IMT&S market. As discussed elsewhere in this filing, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Service 800, Inc. on March 4, 2019. 

On December 31, 2019 TCA Beyond Commerce, a joint venture that is 80% owned by Beyond Commerce, Inc., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase, whereby TCA Beyond Commerce acquired 100% of the authorized and issued membership interests of CCS from its sole member. TCA Beyond Commerce acquired the membership interests for a purchase price of $525,000 (the “CCS Purchase Price”), with $175,000 to be paid in cash and the remaining $350,000 to be paid through TCA Beyond Commerce’s issuance of a convertible promissory note with an original principal of $350,000 and a conversion feature that provides the CCS with the right to convert outstanding principal and accrued interest into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price based on the 10-day trailing average price of the Company’s stock. On November 18,2021 the Company and the sole member of CCS reached a Settlement Agreement whereby the Company paid $100,000 to pay off, cancel and extinguish the convertible promissory note and any other remaining obligations. A $234,667 gain on extinguishment of debt was realized by the Company.

In addition to the CCS purchase price, CCS and Service 800, Inc., entered into an employment agreement whereby the CCS will be employed by Service 800 as Vice President of Operations and Technologies for a period of nine months. The Vice President of Operation resigned in June 2021.

On November 23, 2021, the Company entered into a simple agreement for future equity (the “SAFE”) with Cityfreighter, Inc. (“Cityfreighter”), pursuant to which the Company invested $250,000 (the “Purchase Amount”). Cityfreighter is a California based developer of electric low-floor trucks for the last mile delivery industry. Beyond Commerce received customary representations and warranties from Cityfreighter. The SAFE provides the Company with the right to either (a) future equity in Cityfreighter when it completes an Equity Financing (as defined below), or (b) future equity in Cityfreighter or cash proceeds if there is a liquidity or dissolution event.

On December 2, 2021 the Company executed a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Eletticars (of Italy) to attain the exclusive U.S. rights to its low-speed electric vehicle (“LSEV”). Eletticars is focused on manufacturing and commercializing a low-speed electric vehicle (“LSEV”), a 4-wheeled motor vehicle, not an ATV, with a top speed of 25 mph and weighs less than 3,000 lbs. The Company paid Elettricars an initial payment in the amount of $50,000 in connection with the execution of a Definitive Agreement, which is being held in escrow. If the closing has not occurred prior to the termination date in the Definitive Agreement, Elettricars shall return the payment.

We believe our planned acquisitions support our long-term strategy for growth. We believe such acquisitions will strengthen our competitive position, help us obtain a customer base and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, and begin revenues. We plan to continue to identify strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products, services and technologies which we believe will augment our existing business.

Research and Development

The industry in which we plan to operate and compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and competitive new products and features. As a result, we believe our success, in part, will depend on our ability to build and enhance our products in a timely and efficient manner and to develop and introduce new products that meet client needs while reducing total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, we plan to make and expect to make research and development investments through internal and third-party development activities, third-party licensing agreements and potentially through technology acquisitions. 
Marketing and Sales 

Our sales and marketing plan is built around teams that collaborate to create market awareness and demand, to build a robust sales pipeline and to ensure customer success that drives revenue growth through market identification. 
Sales

We plan to use a direct sales approach that includes inside sales teams and field sales teams. Our planned inside sales team will be based in regional sales hubs when fully implemented, and will qualify and manage accounts throughout the world in a manner in which we can seed new sales at a low cost and expand these accounts over time. The second phase of our planned sales initiative is the development and use of a direct field sales team that will cover North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa; the Asia Pacific region; and Latin America and will be mainly responsible for lead qualification and account management for large enterprises. Our planned direct sales teams will partner with technical sales representatives who will provide pre-sales technical support. We will also have a dedicated customer success team to drive renewals of existing contracts.

We also plan to sell our products through indirect sales channels including technology vendors, resellers and OEM and independent software vendor (ISV) partners. These channels will provide additional sales coverage, solution-based selling, services and training throughout the world. Our channel program will be led by a dedicated sales team.

Marketing

Our planned marketing efforts will focus on establishing our brand, generating awareness, creating leads and cultivating the BYOC user community. The marketing team will be dedicated to product marketing, program marketing, field events, channel marketing, corporate communications and website development. We plan to leverage both online and offline marketing channels such as events and trade shows, seminars and webinars, third-party analyst reports, whitepapers, case studies, blogs, search engines and email marketing. A central focus for the marketing team will be to drive free product trials and encourage use of our free online training and certification, an integral part of our planned customer acquisition process. Our marketing team will be responsible for the logistics of hosting various planned events, including an annual customer conferences and regional events, as well as providing Web-based community tools and supporting customer-driven user groups.
Seasonality 

In the past, our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, in the event that we succeed in bringing our planned products to market.
Market and Competition

The IMT&S industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Key competitive factors include contractual terms and competitive pricing, quality of service, reputation, technical and industry expertise, scope of services, innovative service and product offerings. Key success factors include the ability to access the latest available and most efficient technology and techniques, maintain a highly skilled workforce, maintain effective cost controls, and good project management skills.

The market for our proposed products and related services is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and shifting customer needs and economic pressures. In the Customer Feedback Management Platform (CX) market, our competitors may have single (or narrowly-tailored) solutions or they may have a range of information management solutions. Given the markets in which we plan to operate and the products and services we plan to offer, we believe our top competitors to be Clarabridge, Confirmit, InMoment, MartizCX, Medallia, NICE, Qualtrics, Satmetrix Systems, SMG and Verint Systems.

We believe that many of our competitors in the IMT&S industry would be small, and of those, many are non-employing firms. Companies in the industry in which we intend to operate offer a broad range of product and services tailored to different markets. This mobility has allowed smaller firms to dominate the industry composition, as they tend to provide services to a specific niche market and/or within a specific geographic region. Despite their prevalence, smaller firms contribute only a small percentage of industry revenue. The bulk of revenue is generated by several high-profile global corporations, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, EMC Corporation, SAS, and Accenture. Larger companies maintain an advantage over smaller firms in that they can service national and international clients, with more resources and capabilities, and as such are able to command a higher premium.

We believe that certain competitive factors will affect the market for our future software products and related services, which may include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.

Intellectual Property Rights

Our future success and ability to compete will depend on our ability to develop and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Software products are generally licensed to customers on a non-exclusive basis for internal use in a customer’s organization. We plan to also grant rights in intellectual property that we plan on developing or acquiring to third-parties to allow them to market certain of our future products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for an application of such product or to a specific geographic region.

We plan to rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. The duration of patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the U.S. is typically 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent. While we believe our intellectual property will be an asset, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we do not anticipate that our business will not be materially dependent on any patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

Employees

As of December 31, 2022, the Company currently had twenty-one (21) full-time employees, including Mr. Geordan Pursglove, President, CEO and Director, and 42 part-time employees. The Company has good employee relations, and no employees belong to a bargaining agreement. 
Properties

We currently lease virtual office space at 3773 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite: 500 Las Vegas, NV 89169. We pay an annual fee of $120 for this lease. In February of 2020 the Company moved Service 800, Inc. to 110 Cheshire Lane, Minnetonka Minnesota 55305. Service 800 leases 3,210 square feet of office space under an operating lease agreement with Carlson Center East LLC. The lease, which expires June 30, 2023, requires base monthly rents of $4,160, plus operating expenses. 

The public entity guidance in ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) requires lessees to recognize substantially all leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with a corresponding right-of-use asset. Our accounting policy is to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of the balance sheet.

Legal Proceedings 

A complaint against the Company, dated February 5, 2020, has been filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota, by Jean Mork Bredeson, the former President and former owner of Service 800, making certain claims related to the Company’s acquisition of Service 800, seeking in excess of $1.6 million in damages. On March 16, 2020, the Company and Service 800 filed an answer, counterclaim and third-party claim against Ms. Bredeson and defendants Allen Bredeson and Jeff Schwedinger, former employees of Service 800. Answers and Affirmative and Additional Defenses to Third Party Claims were filed by Ms. Bredeson on April 7, 2020 and by Mr. Schwedinger on April 9, 2020 and, on April 24, 2020, Ms. Bredeson filed a Motion to Dismiss. The Court denied in full Ms. Bredeson’s motion to dismiss or for a more definite statement. Subsequently, using a wholly owned entity she controls, Ms. Bredeson filed another matter, captioned Green Valley Associates Inc. vs Service 800 Inc., 27-CV-20-13800. Although Ms. Bredeson is seeking to have the matters handled by separate judges, the Company sought consolidation of the two matters before Judge Klein, the judge who denied Ms. Bredeson’s motion to dismiss, but the consolidation was denied. Discovery has closed in both cases. Trial commenced on October 3, 2022. After a week of trial, a technical mistrial occurred based on the Court falling under the minimum number of jurors required to maintain the trial. As a result, the trial is now scheduled for May, 2023. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, states that a firm must distinguish between losses that are probable, reasonably probable or remote. If a contingent liability is deemed probable, it must be directly reported in the financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASC 450-20 that updated the Standard and uses “probable,” “reasonably possible,” and “remote” to determine the likelihood of the future event that will confirm a loss, an impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability. 

Accrual of a loss contingency is required when (1) it is probable that a loss has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (2) the amount can be reasonably estimated. No accrual has been made in the above matter as the determination is that a loss is not probable as of December 31, 2022 nor can a loss be reasonably estimated.

In addition to the above, from time to time, we may be involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business. Other than as set forth above, we are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other than as set forth above, to our knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of our executive officers or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our Company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or any of our subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect
