ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, is a corporation organized to develop high strength fibers using recombinant DNA technology for commercial applications in technical textile. We use genetically engineered silkworms that produce spider silk proteins to create our recombinant spider silk. Applications include performance apparel, workwear, filtration, luxury fashion, flexible composites, medical implants, cosmetics and more. We believe that we have been a leader in the research and development of commercially scalable and cost effective spider silk for technical textile and non-fibrous applications. Our primary proprietary fiber technology includes natural and engineered variants of spider silk produced in domesticated mulberry silkworms. Our business brings twenty-first century biotechnology to the historical silk industry, permitting us to introduce materials with innovative properties and claims into an established commercial ecosystem of silkworm rearing, silk spinning and weaving, and manufacture of garments and other products that can include our specialty fibers and textiles. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific uses that require exceptional strength, flexibility, heat resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market is exemplified by two synthetic fiber products that come from petroleum derivatives: (1) aramid fibers; and (2) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. The technical textile industry involves products for both industrial and consumer products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles (e.g., sutures and artificial ligaments), safety and protective clothing and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications (e.g., high-strength composite materials).
 
We are using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target markets, namely the specialty fiber and technical textile industries. We believe that the genetically engineered protein-based fibers we seek to produce have properties that are in some ways superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace. Production of our product in commercial quantities holds what we believe to be potential life-saving ballistic resistant material, which we believe is lighter, thinner, more flexible, and tougher than steel. Other potential applications for spider silk based recombinant fibers include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. We believe that fibers made with recombinant protein-based polymers will make significant inroads into the specialty fiber and technical textile markets.
 
Through our technologies, the introduction of the gene sequence based on those found in native spider silk, results in a germline transformation and is therefore self-perpetuating. This technology is in essence a protein expression platform which has other potential applications including diagnostics and pharmaceutical production. Moreover, our technologies are “green” inasmuch as our fibers and textiles are derived from nature and do not use any petrochemicals as an input into the fibers.
 
The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to our financial statements as of December 31, 2022 include an explanatory paragraph stating that our net loss from operations and net capital deficiency at December 31, 2022 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Recent Developments
 
In August 2019, we received authorization from governmental authorities to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production facility in Vietnam. In October 2019, the Company delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms served as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully completed rearing the first batch of its transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam production factory. Seasonal challenges in late December 2019 slowed production operations and governmental restrictions imposed due to the global COVID pandemic further delayed our operations in 2020. In January of 2021 we received the first shipment of silk from our factory in Vietnam. We believe that we will be able to target metric tons of capacity of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from this factory once it reaches maximum utilization. This capacity will allow us to address initial demand for our products and materials for various applications in the protective, performance, and luxury textile markets.
 
In January 2022, we completed production of the first Dragon Silk yarn produced entirely in Vietnam. The finished recombinant spider silk yarn was spun from raw spider silk produced at Prodigy Textiles. We believe this production fully integrated Prodigy Textiles into Vietnam’s substantial silk textile industry. Vietnam produced nearly 1,000 metric tons of mundane silk in 20201. While Prodigy Textiles remains focused on ramping up the output of recombinant spider silk cocoons, these supporting vendors will play an essential role in processing that silk into finished goods for a wide range of consumer markets. We plan to ship this Dragon Silk yarn to SpydaSilk Enterprises in Singapore, a joint venture partially owned by the Company for weaving into fabrics and finished garments. The Company expects that Prodigy Textiles will continue to leverage expanding silk production to address the material needs of SpydaSilk and make additional materials available for purchase to fill the numerous and backlogged material requests it has received.
 
On July 15, 2022, we signed an agreement with Global Silk Solutions Joint Stock Company (GSS). Under this agreement, GSS will serve as a contract manufacturer for the Company’s recombinant spider silk.
 
Strategic Partnership
 
On November 23, 2020, we entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement (the “SPA”) with Mthemovement Kings Pte Ltd (“Kings”). Kings is an eco-friendly luxury streetwear apparel line, part of the Kings Group of Companies and its affiliated companies. On January 25, 2021, the parties exchanged signatures for an amendment to the Agreement, which amended the procedures for termination of the SPA to only allow for the termination of the SPA by mutual agreement of the Company and Kings following a consultation period of 120 (one hundred and twenty) calendar days or such period as agreed otherwise between the parties (the “Amendment,” together with the SPA, the “Agreement”).
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties have formed a joint venture to develop and sell the Company’s spider silk fibers under the new innovative apparel and fashion brand, trade named SpydaSilk™ and potential other trademarks to be announced. All intellectual property related to SpydaSilk™ will be jointly owned by the Company and Kings. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company granted the joint venture and the SpydaSilk Enteprises Pte. Ltd. brand an exclusive geographic license to all the Company’s technologies for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in exchange for a 4-year firm commitment to purchase up to $32 million of the Company’s raw recombinant spider silk over the 4-year period, with an initial payment of $250,000 to the Company. Kings is projected to purchase an additional $8 million of material in the fourth year and due to lags in production, the Company expects to extend the time period for the purchase commitment, but there is no guarantee that SpydaSilk will agree to such extension or that such additional purchase will be made. Upon commencement, in consideration for its ownership position in the joint venture, the Company shall issue 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to Kings.

The Agreement has a 60-month term, which can be terminated at any time by mutual agreement following a consultation period of 120 days, or such other period as agreed by the parties. If applicable, the parties will honor their share of committed expenditures of the joint venture and King will repay the Company any unused brand funds.
 
Yorkville Transaction
 
On January 18, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with YA II PN, LTD., a Cayman Islands exempt company (“Yorkville”), pursuant to which Yorkville purchased secured convertible debentures (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) in the aggregate principal amount of USD$3,000,000 (the “Convertible Debentures”), which are convertible into shares of Common Stock (as converted, the “Conversion Shares”), of which a secured convertible debenture (the “First Convertible Debenture”) in the principal amount of $1,500,000 (the “First Convertible Debenture Purchase Price”) shall be issued upon signing the Securities Purchase Agreement and a secured convertible debenture (the “Second Convertible Debenture,” together with the First Convertible Debenture, each a “Convertible Debenture” and collectively, the “Convertible Debentures”) in the principal amount of $1,500,000 (the “Second Convertible Debenture Purchase Price”) shall be issued on or about the date that the Securities and Exchange Commission declares the registration statement registering the shares of common stock underlying the notes effective (collectively, the First Convertible Debenture Purchase Price and the Second Convertible Debenture Purchase Price shall collectively be referred to as the “Purchase Price”) (the “Yorkville Transaction”). These additional funds, together with those from the previously completed transactions we conducted with Yorkville between December 2020 and March 2021, account for an $8 million total Yorkville investment; as of November 17, 2022, all debentures to Yorkville pursuant thereto have been satisfied. The Company also issued Yorkville a warrant to purchase 12,500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at an initial exercise price of $0.12 per share and a warrant to purchase 4,285,714 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at an initial exercise price of $0.14 per share. The warrants have a term of five (5) years and can be exercised via cashless exercise. If the Company issues or sells securities at a price less than the applicable warrant exercise price, the exercise price of the applicable warrant shall be reduced to such lower price. The warrants also have the same ownership cap as set forth in the Convertible Debentures, as described below.
 
In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Yorkville, pursuant to which the Company agreed to register all of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Debentures and warrants and with respect to subsequent registration statements, if any, such number of shares of Common Stock as requested by Yorkville not to exceed 300% of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all Convertible Debentures then outstanding (assuming for purposes hereof that (x) such Convertible Debentures are convertible at the then current conversion price and (y) any such conversion shall not take into account any limitations on the conversion of the Convertible Debentures set forth therein, in each case subject to any cutbacks set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.
 
Upon signing the letter of intent for the Yorkville Transaction, the Company paid $10,000 to an affiliate of Yorkville, for due diligence and structuring.
 
The Securities Purchase Agreement also contained customary representation and warranties of the Company and the Investor, indemnification obligations of the Company, termination provisions, and other obligations and rights of the parties.
 
The foregoing description of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Convertible Debentures, Warrant, Security Agreement, IP Security Agreement, Registration Rights Agreement and Guaranty Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the forms of Securities Purchase Agreement, Convertible Debenture and Warrant, which are filed as Exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Maxim Group LLC received a cash placement agent fee of $230,000. 
 
Covid-19
 
On March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff in response to governmental regulations relating to COVID. This decision primarily impacted staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and resulted in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The Company supported its furloughed staff and paid their salaries during all mandatory closures. During the duration of the furlough, the Company’s CEO voluntarily waved the payment or accrual of his salary. The Company leveraged this forced closure time to improve its production infrastructure based on the lessons learned from its operations. After the mandated closure, the Company has enhanced its production operations with process automation, moved its production headquarters to a facility designed for silk production, created a more self-reliant supply chain, and established a microbiology laboratory in its factory for enhanced quality control. The global COVID pandemic and government regulations associated with the pandemic continue to evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, including its potential effect on our plans and timelines.
 
Reverse Stock Split & Series A Voting Power
 
In 2019, in order to facilitate a proposed uplisting to a national exchange, our stockholders approved a possible reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock. However, the Board elected not to proceed with a reverse stock split. A significant factor in that decision was our ability to access financing as described above without having to expend time and money on the uplisting process.

The Product
 
Our products exploit the unique characteristics of spider silk, specifically dragline silk from Nephila clavipes (golden orb-web spider) and variants thereof. Such fibers possess unique mechanical properties in terms of strength, resilience and flexibility. Through the use of genetic engineering, we believe that we have produced a variety of unique transgenic silkworm strains that produce recombinant spider silk. Our recombinant spider silk fiber blends the silk proteins found in spider silk with the native silkworm silk proteins. This approach allows for the cost-effective and eco-responsible production of spider silk at commercial production levels.
Monster Silk®
 
Monster Silk® was the first recombinant spider silk fiber product we developed. Monster Silk incorporates the natural elasticity of spider silk to make a silk fiber which is more flexible that conventional silk fibers and textiles. We have produced sample products using Monster Silk® including knit fabrics, gloves, and shirts in collaboration with textile mills. We expect that Monster Silk® will have market applications across the traditional textile markets where its increased flexibility will provide increased durability and comfort.
 
Dragon SilkTM
 
Dragon SilkTM is the next evolution in recombinant spider silk, combining the elasticity of Monster Silk® with additional high strength elements of native spider silk. Some samples of Dragon SilkTM have demonstrated strength beyond that of native spider silk. This combination of strength and elasticity results in a silk fiber which is soft and flexible, yet tougher than leading synthetic fiber available on the market. Based on inquires we have received from end market leaders, we believe that Dragon SilkTM- will have applications in performance apparel, durable workwear, luxury goods and apparel, and composites.
 
Other Products
 
We are continuing to develop new recombinant silks and other protein-based fibers and materials using our genetic engineering capabilities. Our silkworm based knock-in knock-out production and development platform has significant advantages over our legacy technology which created Dragon Silk and Monster Silk. Chief among these is the potential to produce spider silks with greatly increased purity and performance. Due to the biocompatible and biodegradable properties of silk, we believe that the materials developed using this higher purity process will create opportunities for products in the medical industry, including sutures, grafts, and implants.
Our Technology
 
Our technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm. The silkworm is an efficient commercial and industrial producer of protein based polymers, and forty percent (40%) of the caterpillars’ weight is devoted to the silk glands. The silk glands produce large amounts of an insoluble protein called fibroin, which the silkworm spins into a composite protein thread (silk).
 
We use our genetic engineering technology to create proprietary recombinant silk polymers from the silkworms. On September 29, 2010, we, along with our collaborators at Notre Dame created approximately twenty different strains of transgenic silkworm which produce recombinant silk polymers. In October of 2017, with the support of funding from the U.S. Army, we transitioned our research operations out of Notre Dame and into our own research and development headquarters.
 
Our transgenic silkworms are created by inserting the genes expressing spider silk with either natural or engineered amino acid sequences into the embryos of the silkworm. The spider silk sequence is introduced to the embryo of the silkworm and incorporated into the silkworm genome using state of the art molecular biology approaches. The spider sequence is created on a circular loop of DNA called a plasmid. We developed a method to alter the plasmid DNA to more readily allow the mixing and matching of various targeted traits including spider DNA genes, disease resistance, commercially marketable proteins and other physical properties. In this way, we can combine different genetic cassettes to create fibers and proteins with the desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties more rapidly than through conventional methods.

In addition to this ability to easily mix and match DNA construction, we have also adapted new approaches to accelerate the rate we generate new transgenic silkworms. Our initial approaches limited us to process silkworm eggs at a rate of roughly 50-200 a day, however, we have developed approaches which allows us to process thousands of eggs a day. Utilizing both visual and non-visual genetic markers, we have successfully developed methods to speed up the screening of potentially transgenic silkworms, which allows for rapid screening of transgenic eggs. The eggs expressing the new spider silk constructs or other targeted properties are propagated while the eggs without the visual marker are discarded, greatly increasing the efficiency of our screen for transgenic eggs. This new approach has been highly effective in increasing the rate of development for new transgenics. We have employed this new procedure and have filed patent applications to protect its use.
 
We utilize the latest advancements in molecular biology and genetic engineering to deliver targeted gene incorporations. The new constructs are designed to integrate in the silkworm genome directly where the native silkworm silk is created. First made public in 2020, this capability is designed for the full knock out and knock in replacement of the native silkworm heavy chain silk protein. We believe that this increased expression and incorporation of the spider protein into the silkworm cocoon will lead to increased performance and open the door for additional opportunities beyond fibers and textiles.
 
Production of this material in commercial quantities holds the potential of a life-saving ballistic resistant material, which is lighter, thinner, more flexible, and tougher than steel. However, the Company does not currently have any life-saving ballistic products and could be some time before we are able to produce such a product from the material. Other applications for spider silk based recombinant fibers include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. We believe that fibers made with recombinant protein-based polymers will make significant inroads into the specialty fiber and technical textile markets. Our interactions with manufacturers of high performance textiles, convince us that there is an eager commercial market for our innovative, sustainable, and differentiated technology and products.

Manufacturing
 
Our spider silk technology is designed for easy plug and play incorporation into the existing silk production model. We manufacture and plan to continue to manufacture our proprietary spider silk fibers using traditional silkworm production practices (sericulture).
 
In August 2019, we received authorization from Governmental authorities to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production facility in Quang Nam, Vietnam. In October 2019, we delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms served as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully completed rearing the first batch of our transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam factory. Seasonal challenges in late December 2019 slowed production operations and Governmental restrictions imposed due to the global COVID pandemic further delayed our operations in 2020. In January of 2021, we received the first shipment of silk from our factory in Vietnam. We believe that we will be able to target metric tons of capacity of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from our Vietnamese operations once we reach maximum utilization. This capacity will allow us to address initial demand for our products and materials for various applications in the protective, performance, and luxury textile markets.
 
We contract with local farmers to cultivate and harvest fresh mulberry for our operations. Prodigy Textiles has also established its own mulberry rearing operations as part of our supply chain resilience program. Prodigy Textiles has hired local workers with experience in sericulture production to care for and raise our silkworms through the five instars, or stages, of the silkworm life cycle, including the final instar when the mature caterpillars produce a cocoon comprised of pure silk. These cocoons are then reeled to our specifications to form the final recombinant spider silk threads such as Dragon SilkTM and Monster Silk®.
 
By utilizing existing production methodology in traditional silk regions to produce our high performance materials, we leverage historical knowledge, available labor and existing capital infrastructure for production, spinning, and weaving of our recombinant spider silk materials. This approach reduces the risk to our manufacturing operations and decreases our need for upfront capital expenditure.
 
Working with our contract manufacturer in Vietnam we have identified robustness and acclimation of our silkworm strain to the local climate as the most significant challenges to production. We are working to overcome these challenges by acclimating our silkworms to the local environment and accelerating the introduction of our multi-strain hybrids. These efforts are targeted to increase overall robustness and cocoon size.
 
We believe that we will be able to target metric tons of capacity of recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from our operations in Vietnam once we reach maximum utilization of our current facilities. This capacity will allow us to address our anticipated initial demand for applications in the protective, performance, and luxury textile markets.
 
On March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff in response to governmental regulations relating to COVID. This decision primarily impacted staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and resulted in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The Company supported its furloughed staff and paid their salaries during all mandatory closures. During the duration of the furlough, the Company’s CEO voluntarily waved the payment or accrual of his salary. The Company leveraged this forced closure time to improve its production infrastructure based on the lessons learned from its operations. After the mandated closure, the Company has enhanced its production operations with process automation, moved its production headquarters to a facility designed for silk production, created a more self-reliant supply chain, and established a microbiology laboratory in its factory for enhanced quality control.
 
The global COVID pandemic and government regulations associated with the pandemic continue to evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, including its potential effect on our plans and timelines. See, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak.”

The Market
 
We are focusing our work on the creation of new fibers with unique properties including fibers with potential high performance and technical fiber applications for the performance fiber market. The performance fiber market is currently dominated by two classes of product: aramid fibers, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. These existing products serve the need for materials with high strength, resilience, but are unable to delivery flexibility. Because these synthetic performance fibers are stronger and tougher than steel, they are used in a wide variety of military, industrial, and consumer applications.
 
The military and police are among the users of performance fibers for its ballistic protection. The materials are also used for industrial applications requiring superior strength and toughness, e.g., critical cables and abrasion/impact resistant components. Performance fibers are also employed in safety equipment, high strength composite materials for the aero-space industry and for ballistic protection by the defense industry.
 
The global market for technical textiles was estimated at greater than $184 billion in 2020 and projected to reach $250 billion by 20271.
 
These are industrial materials which have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications. The market for technical textiles can be defined as consisting of:
 

● | Medical textiles; 
--+--------------------------------------------
● | Geotextiles; 
● | Textiles used in Defense and Military; 
● | Safe and Protective Clothing; 
● | Filtration Textiles; 
● | Textiles used in Transportation; 
● | Textiles used in Buildings; 
● | Composites with Textile Structure; and, 
● | Functional and Sportive Textiles. 

 
We believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of protein-based polymers (in other words, genetically engineered silk fibers), will open up new applications for the technology. The materials which we are working to produce are many times tougher and stronger than steel.
 
We are actively pursuing relationships within target end markets to secure product collaborations with key market channel leaders. Due to the unique nature of our product, we received numerous unsolicited requests from leading businesses across a range of attractive end markets requesting materials for applications development. This substantial demand for spider silk materials across the broad spectrum of applications for high performance fibers and textiles, combined with the limited initial production capacity, has provided the opportunity to be selective in choosing market channel partners best able to quickly bring our product to market at scale. We are working under non-disclosure agreements to secure these collaborative development agreements and to establish limited channel exclusivity for firms we believe mirror our culture of innovation. In January 2021 the Company entered into a partnership and exclusive purchase agreement worth up to $40 million with M the Movement by Kings Group. This partnership will establish a jointly owned apparel and fashion brand headquarter in Singapore focuses on sales to the ASEAN region.

Research and Development
 
In 2007, we entered into the first series of the Notre Dame Agreements to develop new transgenic silkworms. In 2010, we achieved our longstanding goal of producing new silk fibers composed of recombinant proteins. In 2016, we received a contract from the U.S. Army to deliver the first samples of its recombinant spider silk materials. In 2017, this contract was expanded to include research into the development of stronger silk materials. As a result of that contract, the Company brought its research operations in-house, opening its own research laboratories and expanding its scientific staff. This transition to in-house operations has led to a series of new technical breakthroughs and is believed to have accelerated the pace of new development. We intend to turn its technology to the development and production of high performance polymers.
 
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have spent approximately 10,375 hours and 9,505 hours, respectively, on research and development activities, which consisted primarily of laboratory research on genetic engineering by our in-house research operations.
 
As of the date of this Report, our research and development efforts remain focused on growing our internal capabilities, but we may consider renewing funding of the collaborative research and development of high strength polymers with Notre Dame or other joint development opportunities; we have not had any formal discussions regarding any such collaborations.
 
We have initiated production of our recombinant materials including Monster Silk® and Dragon SilkTM. Additionally, we plan to accelerate both our microbiology and selective breeding programs, as well as providing more resources for their material and genetic testing protocols in 2023.
 
A key aspect of our research program is designed to target the biggest immediate hurdle to production, the robustness of our silkworms within the large-scale production environment. Working with our contract manufacture in Vietnam we have identified robustness and acclimation of our silkworm lines to the local climate as the most significant challenge to production. Our research department has initiated, and we are accelerating a hybridization program, which is explicitly designed to increase robustness and cocoon size.
 
Our Intellectual Property Approach
 
Our intellectual property strategy utilizes a blended approach of licensed technologies and in-house developments. As part of our intellectual property portfolio, we have licensed the exclusive right to use certain patented gene-splicing technologies for use in silkworm.
 
Under the Notre Dame Agreements, we were issued and exercised our right to exclusive commercial use for spider silk technologies developed under that agreement. We have worked collaboratively with the university to develop fibers with the mechanical characteristics of spider silk. We are applying this proprietary genetic engineering technology to domesticated silkworms, which to our knowledge, is the only proven commercially scaled system for producing silk.
 
In 2017, we opened a research and development facility to expand on the work conducted at Notre Dame. Since opening this new facility, we have expanded our intellectual property portfolio with multiple additional provisional and utility patent filings based on new discoveries and inventions and made numerous advancements that have decreased the development time for new technologies, none of which rely on the patented material from our collaboration with Notre Dame. We will continue to utilize this in-house research facility to expand and strengthen its patent portfolio while also maintaining and growing its trade secret technologies approach to genetic advancement. We are actively working to develop and patent new approaches to the development of genetically engineering silkworms, underlying construction techniques, and fundamental genetic sequences for improved material performance.
 
The Notre Dame Agreements will last for the duration of the patented materials that we developed with Notre Dame. The new technologies that we are developing in our internal research labs does not rely on the Notre Dame patented materials and as a result will not be impacted by an expiration of those agreements.
 
The introduction of the gene sequence, in the manner employed by us, results in a germline transformation and is therefore self-perpetuating.
 
License Agreements/Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained certain rights to use a number of university created, and patented gene splicing and spider silk protein technologies.
 
As part of the joint development program with the University of Notre Dame and the Notre Dame Agreements, Kraig Labs negotiated an option for exclusive global commercial rights to technologies jointly developed with Notre Dame. Kraig Labs has exercised that option. As of the date of this filing, four patents relating to the jointly developed technologies have been issued, number 10-1926286 in South Korea, number 2011314072 in Australia, number 26612 in Vietnam, and number 2,812,791 in Canada. These jurisdictions are a mix of silk producing and consuming countries. We believe protecting our technologies in these countries will be beneficial to our future operations.
 
In addition to the patents related to licensed technologies from Notre Dame listed above, Kraig Labs has filed a number of patent applications and provisional applications based on technologies developed solely within the Company’s own laboratories. Kraig has filed two such patent applications and four provisional patent applications based on technologies developed and discoveries from our own independent research operations.

Notre Dame Agreements
 
As discussed above, in 2007 we entered into the first series of Notre Dame Agreements. We provided financial support to ongoing research and development of transgenic silkworms and the creation of recombinant silk fibers. In exchange, we have an option to obtain the exclusive global commercialization rights to the technology developed pursuant to the research effort.
 
Following the first agreement, we entered into successive intellectual property and collaborative research agreements with Notre Dame to provide different levels of financial support. The trend had been for an increase in financial support for the research and development in nearly every successive agreement. In June 2012, we entered into an Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with Notre Dame (“2012 Notre Dame Research Agreement”). On March 4, 2015, we entered into a new Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with Notre Dame extending the agreement through March 2016 (“2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement”). Under the 2015 Notre Dame Research agreement, the Company provided approximately $534,000 in financial support. On September 20, 2015, the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was amended to increase the total funding by approximately $179,000; in February 2016, the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was extended to July 31, 2016 and in August 2016, the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was extended to December 31, 2016. In May 2017, the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was amended to increase the total funding by approximately $189,000 and the duration of the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement was extended to September 30, 2017. With the funding we received from the U.S. Army, we were able to conduct our research and development in-house, at less cost, and therefore we did not extend the 2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement after September 30, 2017, but in the future we may consider forming new collaborative research agreements.
 
In 2011, we exercised our option to obtain the global commercialization rights to the technology developed under the Notre Dame Agreements, which resulted in a separate license agreement with Notre Dame (the “2011 Notre Dame Agreement”). Pursuant to the 2011 Notre Dame Agreement, Notre Dame filed an international patent application and numerous national patent applications on technology relating to the creation and use of recombinant spider silks and we received exclusive and non-exclusive rights to certain spider silk and gene splicing technologies including commercial rights with the right to sublicense such intellectual property. The 2011 Notre Dame Agreement obligates us to reimburse Notre Dame for costs associated with the filing, prosecuting and maintaining of such patents and patent applications. In exchange for the rights to commercialization, Notre Dame has received 2,200,000 shares of our Common Stock and we have agreed to pay Notre Dame royalties equal to 2% of our gross sales of the licensed products and 10% of any sublicensing fees received by the Company on licensed technology. We have also agreed to pay to Notre Dame $50,000 a year, which will be reduced from the total amount of royalties paid in the same year. The $50,000 payment to Notre Dame is not owed for any year in which the Company is sponsoring research within Notre Dame.
 
Cooperative Agreement in Vietnam
 
On December 30, 2015, we entered into a cooperative agreement with a provincial government office in Vietnam for the research and pilot production of hybrid silkworms. In April 2018, we received our investment registration certificate for our facility in Vietnam. Later that month the Company was issued its ERC so that it could begin operations in Vietnam. We have established a subsidiary in Vietnam which is currently producing our recombinant spider silk in small quantities. Management believes the ERC puts the Company on a path to scale at a much greater level by harnessing existing silk production infrastructure with the capacity to match the existing demand for their spider silk materials.

Other Agreements
 
On October 15, 2013, we entered into an intellectual property agreement with a scientific researcher relating to the development of new recombinant silk fibers. Under the terms of that agreement, the scientific researcher transferred his rights of intellectual property, inventions and trade secrets which the researcher develops relating to recombinant silk to us. Upon signing, the researcher received 8,000,000 common stock purchase warrants from the Company, exercisable 24 months from the date of the agreement. As per the terms of the agreement, the researcher received an additional 10,000,000 warrants after creating a new recombinant silk fiber for us that met specified performance characteristics and another 8,000,000 warrants for performing the contract in good faith. The warrants described above all contain a cashless exercise provision and are exercisable on the 24-month anniversary of the date on which they were issuable under the agreement.
Governmental Regulations
 
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as Vietnam central, provisional, and district laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, labor relations, the labeling and safety of the products we sell, the methods we use to sell these products and/or the production of the products we sell. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations, although no assurance can be provided that this will remain true in the future. Laws and their interpretations can change. With regards to areas where law is vague, lacking, or could be subject to interpretation we endeavor to conform to wide spread industry norms.
Environment
 
Kraig Labs is fully committed to its vision of bringing spider silk technologies to commercial markets while maintaining the highest levels of environmental responsibility. We believe our technology, built on a renewable resource, has a positive environmental impact and offers significant benefits over competing synthetic textiles. Our production system is derived from nature and does not use any petrochemicals as an input into our fibers.
 
We seek to comply with and exceed all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality. Expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 
While being environmentally conscious is the objective of all producers in this industry, the fermentation process used by our competitors produces high levels of carbon dioxide. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and is argued to be the leading cause of global warming. In stark contrast, Kraig Labs’ mulberry trees and the silk from silkworms have proven to be effective at sequestering carbon dioxide and are renewable resources. Mulberry trees are also very low maintenance, while still providing essential global green-cover and significantly help in reducing soil erosion in areas.
 
In addition to climate impacts of the fermentation approach, solvents typically used to wet-spin fibers can have significant environmental impacts. DMSO, a common wet-spinning solvent, can be absorbed directly through human skin, carrying with it potentially dangerous side effects. This is another reason we pride ourselves on the use of silkworms, which do not require the use of DMSO, to produce our products.
 
Competition
 
We compete directly with numerous other companies with similar product lines and/or distribution that have extensive capital, resources, market share, and brand recognition.
 
There are presently three primary competitors that we face in our industry, but there are few barriers to entry in our industry. This creates the strong possibility of new competitors emerging, and of others succeeding in developing the same or similar fibers for application that we are trying to develop. The effects of this increased competition may be materially adverse to us and our stockholders. As this is an emergent industry there is no one producer that has captured a significant portion of the market. Bolt Threads, Inc. based in California and Spiber Inc. based in Japan are competitors which have raised the largest amounts of investment capital to date. We also compete with AMSilk, which is based in Germany. We believe that our technology offers more cost-effective methods with lower environmental impact than technologies used by our identified competitors, however, new technologies could be developed that remove this advantage.

These competitors have raised and spent 100’s of millions of dollars in pursuit of the same results that we have achieved, but through different and more complex means. The Company believes that its competitors will continue to overspend while struggling to deliver the results that we have been able to achieve utilizing the existing global infrastructure.
 
Based on our research and internal assessments, the following chart illustrates why we believe we have a competitive advantage over our three main, known competitors:
 

Employees
 
The Company currently employs between 8-11 people at its U.S. facilities, 6 full-time and up to 5 part-time, including Kim Thompson, our officer and sole director and Jonathan R. Rice, our Chief Operating Officer. The Company employs between 8-30 full time personnel at its Vietnamese subsidiary depending on the production cycle. We plan to hire more persons on as-needed basis.
