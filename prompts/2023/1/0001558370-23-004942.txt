ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
RH (collectively, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a leading retailer and luxury lifestyle brand operating primarily in the home furnishings market. Our curated and fully integrated assortments are presented consistently across our sales channels, including our retail locations, websites and Source Books. We offer merchandise assortments across a number of categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, décor, outdoor and garden, and baby, child and teen furnishings. 
Our retail business is fully integrated across our multiple channels of distribution. We position our Galleries as showrooms for our brand, while our websites and Source Books act as virtual and print extensions of our physical spaces, respectively. We operate our retail locations throughout the United States, Canada, and the U.K., and have an integrated RH Hospitality experience in 14 of our Design Gallery locations, which includes Restaurants and Wine Bars.
In addition, we opened our first RH Guesthouse in New York in September 2022, a first-of-its-kind hospitality experience for travelers seeking privacy and luxury. The property features six guest rooms, three guest suites and a private residence, as well as The Dining Room & Terrace.
Macroeconomic Factors
There are a number of macroeconomic factors and uncertainties affecting the overall business climate as well as our business, including increased inflation, rising interest and mortgage rates, and uncertainties in the global financial markets related to the foregoing as well as, among other things, the war in Ukraine and recent failures of several financial institutions, including Silicon Valley Bank and others. These and other macroeconomic factors may have a number of adverse effects on economic conditions and markets in which we operate, including the housing market, with the potential for an economic recession and a sustained downturn in the housing market. Factors such as a slowdown in the housing market or negative trends in stock market prices could have a negative impact on demand for our products. We believe that these macroeconomic factors have contributed to the slowdown in demand that we have experienced in our business over the last several fiscal quarters.
​
Our decisions regarding the sources and uses of capital will continue to reflect and adapt to changes in market conditions and our business, including further developments with respect to macroeconomic factors. For more information, refer to Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.
Key Value-Driving Strategies
In order to achieve our long-term strategies of Product Elevation, Platform Expansion and Cash Generation as well as drive growth across our business, we are focused on the following key strategies and business initiatives:
Product Elevation. We believe we have built the most comprehensive and compelling collection of luxury home furnishings under one brand in the world. Our products are presented across multiple collections, categories and channels that we control, and their desirability and exclusivity has enabled us to achieve industry-leading revenues and margins. Our customers know our brand concepts as RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Contemporary, RH Outdoor, RH Beach House, RH Ski House, RH Baby & Child, RH TEEN and Waterworks. Our strategy is to continue to elevate the design and quality of our product. Over the next few years, we plan to introduce RH Couture, RH Bespoke and RH Color.
​
Gallery Transformation. Our product is elevated and rendered more valuable by our architecturally inspiring Galleries. We believe our strategy to open new Design Galleries in every major market in North America will unlock the value of our vast assortment, generating an expected annual revenue opportunity for our business of $5 to $6 billion. We believe we can significantly increase our sales by transforming our real estate platform from our existing legacy retail footprint to a portfolio of Design Galleries sized to the potential of each market and the size of our assortment. In addition, we plan to incorporate hospitality into most of the new Design Galleries that we open in the future, which further elevates and renders our product and brand more valuable. We believe hospitality has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality drives incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries.

​



Brand Elevation. We are evolving the brand beyond curating and selling product to conceptualizing and selling spaces by building an ecosystem of Products, Places, Services and Spaces designed to elevate and render our product more valuable while establishing the RH brand as a thought leader, taste and place maker. We believe our seamlessly integrated ecosystem of immersive experiences inspires customers to dream, design, dine, travel and live in a world thoughtfully curated by RH, creating an impression and connection unlike any other brand in the world. Our hospitality efforts will continue to elevate the RH brand as we extend beyond the four walls of our Galleries into RH Guesthouses, where our goal is to create a new market for travelers seeking privacy and luxury in the $200 billion North American hotel industry. We entered this industry with the opening of our RH Guesthouse in New York in September 2022, and are in the process of constructing our second RH Guesthouse in Aspen. Additionally, we are creating bespoke experiences like RH Yountville, an integration of Food, Wine, Art & Design in the Napa Valley, RH1 & RH2, our private jets, and RH3, our luxury yacht that is available for charter in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. These immersive experiences expose new and existing customers to our evolving authority in architecture, interior design and landscape architecture. 
​
Digital Reimagination. Our strategy is to digitally reimagine the RH brand and business model both internally and externally. Internally, our multi-year effort began with the reimagination of our Center of Innovation & Product Leadership to incorporate digitally integrated visuals and decision data designed to amplify the creative process from product ideation to product presentation. Externally, our strategy comes to life digitally through The World of RH, an online portal where customers can explore and be inspired by the depth and dimension of our brand. Launched in the spring of 2022, The World of RH includes rich, immersive content with simplified navigation and search functionality, all designed to enhance the shopping experience and render our product and brand more valuable. We expect to continue to elevate the customer experience on The World of RH with further enhancements to content, navigation and search functionality. We believe an opportunity exists to create similar strategic separation online as we have with our Galleries offline, reconceptualizing what a website can and should be.
​
Global Expansion. We believe that our luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetic have strong international appeal, and that pursuit of global expansion will provide RH a substantial opportunity to build over time a projected $20 to $25 billion global brand in terms of annual revenues. Our view is that the competitive environment globally is more fragmented and primed for disruption than the North American market, and there is no direct competitor of scale that possesses the product, operational platform, and brand of RH. As such, we are actively pursuing the expansion of the RH brand globally with the objective of launching international locations in Europe beginning with the opening of RH England, The Gallery at the Historic Aynho Park, this summer. We have secured a number of locations in various markets in the U.K. and continental Europe for future Design Galleries and are currently in lease or purchase negotiations for additional locations. 
Products and Product Development
We have positioned RH as a lifestyle brand and design authority by offering expansive merchandise assortments. We are merchants of luxury home furnishings and our products embody our design aesthetic and reflect inspiration from across the centuries and around the globe.
We have developed a proprietary product development platform that is fully integrated from ideation to presentation. Key aspects of our product development platform are:
Organization—We have established a collaborative, cross-functional organization leading our product development, sourcing, merchandising, inventory and creative teams. Our product teams are focused on maximizing the sales potential of each product category across all channels, which eliminates channel conflicts and functional redundancies.
Process—For many of our products, we work closely with our network of artisan partners who possess specialized product development and manufacturing capabilities and who we consider an extension of our product development team. We collaborate with our global network of specialty vendors and manufacturers to produce artisanal pieces of high quality and value on a large scale, including both distinctive original designs and reinterpretations of antiques.
Facility—We have built the RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, a facility that supports the entire product development process from product ideation to presentation across all channels.
Our proprietary organization, process and facility enhance our ability to introduce more new products with each collection. In addition, our product development platform, sourcing capabilities and significant scale enable us to reduce our product costs.

Sales Channels
We distribute our products through a fully integrated sales platform comprising our retail locations, including RH Galleries and Waterworks Showrooms, in addition to our websites, Source Books, Trade and Contract, and Outlets. We believe the level of integration among all of our channels and our approach to the market distinguish us from other retailers. We encourage our customers to shop across our channels, which complement one another, and have aligned our business and internal organization to be channel agnostic. 
Retail Locations
As of January 28, 2023, our retail locations comprise RH Galleries and Waterworks Showrooms:

(2) | We have an integrated RH Hospitality experience in fourteen of our Design Galleries. We also have RH Hospitality in our one RH Guesthouse.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Galleries reinforce our luxury brand aesthetic and are highly differentiated from other home furnishings retailers. We have revolutionized the customer experience by showcasing products in a sophisticated lifestyle setting, consistent with the imagery and product presentation featured on our websites and in our Source Books. Products in our Galleries are presented in fully appointed rooms, emphasizing collections over individual pieces. This presentation inspires our customers to consider purchasing a full collection of products to replicate the design aesthetic experienced in our Galleries. In addition, our associates use iPads and other devices to allow customers to shop our entire merchandise assortment while in a retail location.
We believe situating our Galleries in desirable locations, such as iconic buildings and luxury retail shopping centers, is critical to the success of our business. New sites are identified based on a variety of store-specific factors – including unique architecture, geographic location, demographics, and proximity to affluent consumers – in addition to our ability to negotiate favorable economic terms and to procure permits and complete construction in a timely manner. We pursue a market-based sales strategy, whereby we assess each market’s overall sales potential and how best to approach the market across all of our channels. We customize square footage, as well as Source Book circulation, to maximize each market’s sales potential and increase our return on invested capital.
We believe our integrated RH hospitality experience, which includes Restaurants and Wine Bars, has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality drives incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries. We plan to incorporate hospitality into most of the new Galleries that we open in the future.
We have identified key learnings from our real estate transformation that have supported the development of a multi-tier market approach described below that we believe will optimize both market share and return on invested capital.

​

​



First, we have architected Design Galleries to be innovative and flexible formats that will enable us to more quickly place our disruptive product assortment and immersive retail experience into the market. We will continue to utilize these designs and innovate based on key learnings from more recent Design Gallery openings. Our most common Design Galleries have approximately 30,000 to 40,000 leased selling square feet, inclusive of our integrated hospitality experience, and present our product assortments across our businesses and contain interior design offices and presentation rooms where design professionals work with clients on their projects. These designs are capital efficient and accelerate the development process. Examples of these upcoming Galleries include Palo Alto, California and Cleveland, Ohio.
Second, we will continue to develop and open larger Bespoke Design Galleries in the top metropolitan markets, similar to those we opened in New York and Chicago. These iconic locations are highly profitable statements for our brand, and we believe they create a long-term competitive advantage that will be difficult to duplicate. We opened our Bespoke Design Gallery, RH San Francisco, The Gallery at the Historic Bethlehem Steel Building, in May 2022 and expect to open additional Bespoke locations in the coming years, including RH England, The Gallery at the Historic Aynho Park, RH New Jersey, The Gallery at the Historic Alnwick Hall and other locations in the U.S. and Europe.
Third, we will continue to open Bespoke Galleries in the best second-home markets where Galleries are tailored to reflect the local culture and are sized to the potential of each market. Examples of current Bespoke Galleries include our location in Yountville, California, as well as our Gallery under development in Aspen, Colorado. 
Fourth, we have developed alternative Design Gallery formats with varying sizes that are suited to many smaller and mid-sized North American markets, and we are testing this approach as we open new Galleries in different new locations. 
Finally, we believe there is an opportunity to address new markets locally by opening new Design Studios in neighborhoods, towns and small cities where the wealthy and affluent live, visit and vacation. We have several existing locations that validate this strategy in East Hampton, Yountville, Los Gatos, Pasadena and our former San Francisco Gallery in the Design District, where we have approximately 2,000 to 5,000 square feet and are able to generate substantial annual revenues.
The cadence of our Gallery openings depends upon a number of factors. We plan to expand our product sales to additional international markets and have signed agreements for Design Galleries in several locations outside of North America, including the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Belgium.

(1) | The London retail location is a Waterworks Showroom.
----+-----------------------------------------------------

We continually analyze opportunities to selectively consolidate retail locations in connection with openings of our Design Galleries or close retail locations that have been under-performing or are no longer consistent with our brand positioning. In many cases, we continue to operate a retail location until our lease has expired in order to effect the closure in a cost-efficient manner.
Websites 
Our primary RH websites, www.rh.com, www.rhmodern.com, www.rhbabyandchild.com and www.rhteen.com, provide our customers with the ability to purchase our merchandise online. We sell Waterworks products online through www.waterworks.com.
Our websites allow our customers to experience the unique lifestyle settings reflected in our Source Books and throughout our Galleries and Showrooms, and to shop all of our current product assortment. We update our websites regularly to reflect new products, product availability and occasional special offers.
The RH websites also offer room-based navigation, which allows the customer to envision and shop items by room or by product, expanding on the richness of the online experience. Customers can search the websites for products by size or color, browse through our extensive product categories and see detailed information about each item and collection, such as dimensions, materials and care instructions. Additionally, customers can select color swatches and view merchandise displayed with different color and fabric options.
Source Books
We produce a series of catalogs, which we refer to as Source Books, to showcase our merchandise assortment. Our Source Books include RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Outdoor, RH Baby & Child and TEEN, RH Beach House, RH Ski House and RH Rugs. Additionally, we launched the RH Contemporary Source Book in fiscal 2022. Our Source Books are one of our primary branding and advertising vehicles. We have found that merchandise assortments displayed in our Source Books contribute to increased sales of those products across all of our channels. As in our Galleries, our Source Books present our merchandise in lifestyle settings that reflect our unique design aesthetic. Our Source Books also feature profiles of select artisan vendors and other compelling editorial content regarding home décor. All creative work on our Source Books is coordinated in-house in our RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, providing us greater control over the brand image presented to our customers, while also reducing our Source Book production costs.

​



Our Source Book mailings serve as a key driver of sales through both our retail locations and websites. Our customers respond to the Source Books across all of our channels, with sales trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently in our Source Books, websites and Galleries. Our Source Books, in concert with our websites, are a cost-effective means to test new products, and allow us to launch categories in a disciplined, expeditious and cost-effective manner. We continue to evaluate and optimize our Source Book strategy based on our experience.
We maintain a database of customer information, including information from our RH Members Program. Our customer database includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information and certain demographic information, as well as mailing and email addresses. We mail our Source Books to addresses within this database and to addresses provided to us by third parties. The database, which is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy disclosed on our website, supports our ability to analyze our customers’ buying behaviors across sales channels, facilitates the development of targeted marketing strategies, and supports prospecting new customers. We segment our customer files based on multiple variables, and we tailor our Source Book mailings and emails in response to the purchasing patterns and product needs of our customers. We continue to improve the segmentation of customer files and the expansion of our customer database.
Trade and Contract
In the Trade channel, we work directly with residential interior designers and decorators purchasing products for their clients’ residential projects. We also sell directly to consumers who make purchases with the assistance of their residential interior designer or decorator. Our Contract business supplies products to large-scale, luxury hospitality, commercial and residential development projects globally, working directly with hotel ownership groups and brands, commercial property owners, single-family and multi-family builders and developers and their ecosystem of architecture, interior design and purchasing business partners. These channels enable us to reach new business customers and the consumers they influence.
Outlet Stores
Our outlet stores are branded as RH Outlet or Restoration Hardware Outlet and are typically located in outlet malls. Our outlet stores serve as a key part of our reverse logistics platform and provide an efficient means to sell primarily returned merchandise and, to a lesser extent, discontinued and overstock merchandise outside of our core sales channels. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 37 outlet stores.
Marketing and Advertising
Our Galleries, websites and Source Books are the primary branding and advertising vehicles for the RH brand. In addition, we employ a variety of marketing and advertising techniques to drive customer traffic across all our channels, strengthen and reinforce our brand image and acquire new customers. These include targeted Source Book circulation, email communications, promotional mailings, print advertisements, and public relations activities and events. We use our customer database to tailor our programs and increase the efficiency of our marketing and promotional initiatives. We leverage our marketing and advertising expenses across all our channels as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our investment.
The highly differentiated design aesthetic and environment of our Galleries drives customer traffic not only to our physical spaces but also to our websites. Our Source Books and targeted emails further reinforce the RH brand image and drive sales across all of our channels. We also participate in a wide range of other marketing, promotional and public relations activities. These campaigns include media coverage in design, lifestyle, culture/society and specialty publications, as well as in-Gallery events related to new Gallery openings and product launches. In addition, we engage in print advertising in brand-relevant publications such as Architectural Digest, Elle Décor, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, WSJ. Magazine, Business of Home, Luxe Interiors + Designs, C Magazine and others. We believe that these efforts drive increased brand awareness, leading to higher sales over time.
RH Members Program
The RH Members Program reimagines and simplifies the shopping experience. For an annual fee, the RH Members Program provides a set discount every day across the RH brand, excluding RH Hospitality and Waterworks, in addition to other benefits, including complimentary design services through the RH Interior Design program and eligibility for preferred financing plans on the RH Credit Card. The RH Members Program allows our customers to shop for what they want, when they want, and receive the greatest value, which has resulted in orders and sales being more evenly distributed throughout the year. During fiscal 2022, our members drove approximately 97% of sales in our core RH business, and we had approximately 351,000 members at year end. Our core RH business reflects the product categories that the membership discount can be applied to, and, as a result, sales generated via Outlet, Contract, Hospitality or Waterworks are excluded. We believe our membership model enhances the customer experience, renders our brand more valuable, improves operational execution and reduces costs.

Sourcing
Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and using vendors that can provide the quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. We work closely with vendors and manufacturers to ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met. We seek to ensure the consistent quality of our manufacturers’ products by selectively inspecting pre-production samples, conducting periodic site visits to certain of our vendors’ production facilities and selectively inspecting inbound shipments at our distribution facilities. In fiscal 2022, we sourced approximately 75% of our purchase dollar volume from approximately 25 vendors. In fiscal 2022, one vendor accounted for 13% of our purchase dollar volume. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2022, 71% of our products were sourced from Asia, with 29% sourced from China, 12% from the United States and the remainder from other countries and regions.
We have a limited number of long-term merchandise supply contracts, but we believe that we generally have strong relationships with our product vendors. Although we transact business primarily on an order-by-order basis, we typically work with many of our vendors over extended periods of time, and many vendors continue to make long-term capacity investments to serve our increasing demands. We develop relationships with our vendors in order to achieve significant cost savings and improve our product development process by eliminating the use of most third-party purchasing agents in favor of a model in which we directly manage our vendors.
Distribution and Delivery
We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our distribution centers. We currently operate three furniture fulfillment centers and one small-parcel fulfillment center servicing RH products, which are located strategically in four markets throughout the United States. We have one fulfillment center in the United States servicing Waterworks products. 
We operate portions of our home delivery services in 21 key markets to leverage operating costs and improve our customers’ delivery experience, while reducing returns and damage to our products. We offer a white glove home delivery service for our larger merchandise and furniture categories, where third-party personnel deliver fully assembled items to the location of our customers’ choice. We believe there is an opportunity to improve the customer experience by taking greater control of the home delivery experience over time. We believe that many third-party furniture delivery providers are designed to support mass and mid-market companies and that significant opportunity exists for developing improved solutions for the luxury market. We believe we have dramatically enhanced the customer experience while reducing return rates, damages and deliveries per order by enhancing the quality of our delivery providers through metric-based accountability standards. 
In addition, we have one third-party distribution center in Europe and continue to develop our supply chain strategy in connection with our global expansion.
We believe our supply chain and fulfillment operations allow us to manage customer orders and distribute merchandise to our customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner, and we continue to identify opportunities to improve the delivery of our products. 
Competition
The home furnishings sector is highly competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of the design, style and quality of our products, the breadth of our assortment of high-quality merchandise and the luxury positioning of our brand. We believe that customers respond favorably to the style and presentation of our products and that we offer consumers a substantial assortment of curated merchandise selections as part of a lifestyle experience. We continue to elevate our product assortment and create separation between our brand and that of many of our competitors. 
We compete with the interior design trade and specialty stores, as well as antique dealers and other merchants that provide unique items and custom-designed products at higher price points. We also compete with a number of other home furnishing retailers, including national and regional businesses as well as new market participants. We will face new competitors as we expand our business globally. In addition, we compete with mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings.

​



We compete by offering what we believe is superior quality, highly distinctive design styles and a sophisticated lifestyle presentation in our product offering. We also believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate and define product trends, as well as to timely anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands. Many of our competitors seek to compete with us by offering products that are similar to our merchandise at lower price points. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. However, many smaller specialty retailers may lack the financial resources, infrastructure, scale and national brand identity necessary to compete effectively with us.
Our People

We are a vision-led organization with a strong culture, led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Friedman, in partnership with our senior leadership team. Together, they instill a company-wide commitment to our Vision, Values and Beliefs. Our Values – People, Quality, Service, and Innovation – are brought to life by our associates across the organization.
Our success and future growth depends largely upon the continued service of our leadership team, as well as our talented associates across all parts of our organization.

We endeavor to reward individual and team contribution, demonstrated by the delivery of long-term, sustainable results. Our compensation programs are designed to align the interests of our officers and associates with our Vision, Values and objectives, as well as our business strategy.
RH is an equal opportunity employer, and we believe in meritocratic hiring. Our goal is to have the right person in every position throughout our organization. We strongly believe our performance is enhanced by a workforce composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience that align with the needs of our business, culture and Values. We have a policy that prohibits us from discriminating against any applicant or associate and this policy governs all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, discipline, job assignments, benefits, transfer and discharge. We believe that our commitment to diversity is demonstrated by the composition of our workforce.
We are committed to operating our environments with the highest safety standards to ensure the health and well-being of our guests and team members.

Intellectual Property
The “RH,” “Restoration Hardware,” “RH Interiors,” “RH Contemporary,” “RH Modern,” “RH Outdoor,” “RH Baby & Child,” “RH TEEN,” “RH Beach House,” “RH Ski House,” “RH Guesthouse,” “RH Rugs,” “The World of RH” and “Waterworks,” trademarks, among others, are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Each of our trademark registrations is perpetually renewable provided that we use or continue to use the trademarks in commerce in the particular geographic market and for the goods or services covered by the registration. In addition, we own many domain names, including “rh.com,” “restorationhardware.com,” “rhmodern.com,” “rhbabyandchild.com,” “rhteen.com,” “rhbeachouse.com,” “rhskihouse.com,” “rhguesthouse.com,” “waterworks.com” and others that include our trademarks. These domain names are perpetually renewable. We own design patents or pending design patent applications to protect the ornamental appearance of several of our products. These design patents are valid for 15 years from their date of issuance. We own copyrights, including copyright registrations or pending applications, for our website and our Source Books. We believe that our trademarks, domain names, design patents, and copyrights have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement.
Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
Our quarterly results vary depending upon a variety of factors, including changes in our product offerings and the introduction of new merchandise assortments and categories, changes in retail locations, the timing of Source Book releases, and the extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of our numerous strategic initiatives, among other things. For example, we have historically experienced some seasonality in our business trends as our sales are typically higher in the second fiscal quarter, which correlates to a peak selling season for outdoor items and outdoor furniture. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands may fluctuate during the year. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year.
Corporate Information
The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on August 18, 2011. On November 7, 2012, the Company completed an initial public offering. On December 15, 2016, Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change its name to “RH,” effective January 1, 2017.
Regulation and Legislation
We are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment laws, customs, laws governing truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of our retail and hospitality locations, outlets and warehouse facilities, in the United States and other international locations in which we operate presently or plan to in the future, as well as in jurisdictions from which we source our products. We believe we are in material compliance with laws applicable to our business.
