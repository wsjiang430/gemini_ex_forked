Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
 
bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) develops noninvasive, early-stage diagnostics to detect and researches targeted therapies to detect and treat lung cancer and other diseases of the lung at the cellular level. Our Company also is conducting early-stage research focused on advancing therapeutic discoveries that could result in broad-spectrum cancer treatments. We develop proprietary noninvasive diagnostic tests and cancer therapeutics using technology that preferentially targets cancer cells and cell populations indicative of a diseased state.
 
The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on March 26, 2014. On June 15, 2016, we formed OncoSelect® Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Research and optimization of our platform technologies are conducted in our laboratories at The University of Texas at San Antonio.
 
Our first diagnostic test, CyPath® Lung, addresses the need for noninvasive detection of early-stage lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Physicians are able to order CyPath® Lung to assist in their assessment of patients who are at high risk for lung cancer. The CyPath® Lung test enables physicians to more confidently distinguish between patients who will likely benefit from timely intervention and more invasive follow-up procedures from patients who are likely without lung disease and should continue annual screening. CyPath® Lung has the potential to increase overall diagnostic accuracy of lung cancer, which could lead to increased survival, fewer unnecessary invasive procedures, reduced patient anxiety, and lower medical costs.
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, OncoSelect® Therapeutics, LLC, our research has led to discoveries and advancement of novel cancer therapeutics that specifically and selectively target cancer cells. We are focused on expanding our broad-spectrum platform technologies to continue developing tests that detect and therapies that target various types of cancer and potentially other diseases.
 
Information regarding the general development of bioAffinity’s business can be found in the “Business” section of our final IPO prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) on September 2, 2022 (the “Final Prospectus”) (see https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1712762/000149315222024949/form424b4.htm).
 
Our First Diagnostic Test – CyPath® Lung
 
Overview of the CyPath® Lung Methodology
 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, claiming nearly 1.8 million lives annually.1 Individuals at high risk for lung cancer are recommended for annual screening by low-dose computed tomography (“LDCT”). Apart from LDCT, there is currently no reliable noninvasive method that can detect lung cancer at an early stage. Our first diagnostic test, CyPath® Lung, is designed to be a cost-effective,2 noninvasive, early-stage lung cancer diagnostic. Using CyPath® Lung in conjunction with LDCT is predicted to improve the positive predictive value (the proportion of true positive results) by a factor of five.2 Improving the positive predictive value of LDCT with the use of CyPath® Lung can result in fewer patients unnecessarily subjected to invasive diagnostic procedures, earlier detection of lung cancer, and a reduction in healthcare costs.3

CyPath® Lung uses flow cytometry technology to detect and analyze cell populations in a person’s sputum, or phlegm, to find characteristics indicative of lung cancer, including cancer and/or cancer-related cells that have shed from a lung tumor. The flow cytometer is a well-established instrument used in many commercial laboratories that records properties of labeled and unlabeled single cells. Sputum is an excellent sample for analysis because it is in direct contact with any malignancy in the lungs and can thus provide a snapshot of the tumor itself, its microenvironment, and its area of field cancerization. While studies have shown that expert cytological analysis of sputum can detect cancerous and pre-malignant cells,4 the process of looking at microscopy slides is an extremely laborious approach and demands years of expertise. CyPath® Lung uses flow cytometry and automated data analysis developed by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows for an entire sample of sputum to be examined for cost-effective, large-scale screening or diagnosis.
 
In particular, CyPath® Lung uses a synthetic porphyrin called meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (“TCPP”), which is a naturally highly fluorescent porphyrin that has an unusually high affinity for cancer and cancer-associated cells.5 The uptake and retention of TCPP in cancerous tissue and its fluorescent properties make TCPP an excellent bio-label for cancer. As used in CyPath® Lung, the proportion of cells with high TCPP fluorescence intensity in a patient’s sputum sample is a significant predictor of lung cancer. bioAffinity holds multiple patents protecting its use of TCPP for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of cancer. In addition, the Company has multiple domestic and foreign patent applications to protect the use of flow cytometry and its AI-developed automated analysis platform in the detection of lung cancer and other lung diseases using sputum as a sample.
 
We developed an algorithm using AI to distinguish samples from high-risk patients who had lung cancer from those who are cancer-free. Precision Pathology Services (“Precision Pathology”) developed CyPath® Lung for sale as a Laboratory Developed Test (an “LDT”) in accordance with the standards of the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and the regulations and guidance of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). In developing the test as an LDT, Precision Pathology developed and integrated software into the test protocol, which generated high-throughput and user-friendly, standardized analysis of flow cytometric sample data. Our test can analyze an average sputum sample containing about 20 million cells in less than 20 minutes. A physician’s report is generated within minutes after data acquisition. The test can be put into routine lab use without requiring expert evaluation of samples or being subject to operator bias. Our approach allows the entire sputum sample to be rapidly analyzed. The numerical analysis developed by AI captures complex interactions between lung cancer, the microenvironment, and areas of field cancerization that would be difficult if not impossible for individuals to predict or detect reliably by eye. For example, during test development, we discovered that viability staining density suggests a link with apoptosis, or cell death, that is linked to many cancers, including lung cancer. Our model also suggests that specific markers of immune cell populations may be informative as to the presence of cancer in the lung. These findings are the result of our AI approach to automated analysis.
 
To our knowledge, CyPath® Lung is the first cancer diagnostic that combines automated flow cytometric analysis to predict the presence of lung cancer from sputum samples.
 
Clinical Validation, Certification, and Classification of CyPath® Lung
 
A 19-month test validation clinical trial of CyPath® Lung6 collected sputum noninvasively from people at high risk for lung cancer, including patients with the disease (N=28) and those cancer-free (N=122). Patients collected their sputum sample over three days at home before bringing their sample to the clinical collection site. Samples were shipped overnight to the laboratory for analysis. Study participants in the high-risk cohort had a CT to confirm they did not have lung cancer. Those in the cancer cohort had imaging and a biopsy that confirmed lung cancer. After providing a sputum sample, participants were released from the study after a physician either confirmed the individual was cancer-free by examination of CT imaging or confirmed the presence of lung cancer by biopsy. Flow cytometry and patient data used in analysis to produce the results included (1) the proportion of cells with a high ratio of high TCPP fluorescence intensity over cell size; (2) the proportion of cells with an intermediate ratio of fluorescence intensity caused by the viability dye (FVS510) over cell size; (3) the proportion of cells that were CD206 negative but positive for one or more of the following markers: CD66b (granulocytes), CD3 (T cells), and CD19 (B cells); and (4) patient age.

More than half of those in the cancer cohort had lung cancer in the earlier Stages I-II. The analysis, performed on an LSRII flow cytometer, resulted in 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity in the subgroup of these patients (N=132) who had no nodules or lung nodules smaller than 20 mm on their LDCT scan, while eight out of 10 (80%) of Stage I tumors were correctly identified. Sensitivity is the percentage of persons with the disease – in this case lung cancer – who are correctly identified by the test. Specificity is the percentage of persons without lung cancer who are correctly identified by the test. The cancer group included all lung cancer types, but mostly squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma lung cancer (in near equal numbers), showing that CyPath® Lung detects all types of lung cancer.
 
Following completion of the test validation trial, CyPath® Lung was evaluated independently by Precision Pathology, which developed the test for sale as an LDT in accordance with CAP/CLIA standards. An LDT is a type of in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) test that is developed, validated, and performed within a single laboratory. CyPath® Lung has been validated and is being performed by Precision Pathology, a CAP-accredited, CLIA-certified clinical pathology laboratory in San Antonio, Texas, pursuant to a joint development agreement with the Company. In third quarter 2022, Precision was inspected by CAP in accordance with CAP/CLIA regulatory standards and regulations resulting in continued accreditation for the laboratory and the CyPath® Lung test as an LDT.
 
As part of CAP/CLIA certification, Precision Pathology evaluated the performance of CyPath® Lung employing its own laboratory technicians and a different flow cytometer, the Navios EX. Results of Precision Pathology’s certification were comparable to those from the test validation trial and demonstrated that CyPath® Lung remains robust to differences in sample handling, processing, and the type of flow cytometer.
 
bioAffinity Technologies intends to voluntarily seek FDA clearance of the CyPath® Lung as a Class II IVD medical device for the detection of lung cancer. The Company has designed its pivotal trial with guidance from its clinical research organization (“CRO”), Courante Oncology, and has prepared a pre-submission that will be submitted to the FDA for review and feedback. We anticipate a three-year diagnostic trial including an 18-month patient enrollment of approximately 1,800 patients, with participants followed for at least one year after enrollment to determine whether they have lung cancer. Similar to the test validation trial, the planned pivotal trial will analyze flow cytometry and patient data including (1) the proportion of cells with a high ratio of high TCPP fluorescence intensity over cell size; (2) the proportion of cells with an intermediate ratio of fluorescence intensity caused by the viability dye (FVS510) over cell size; (3) the proportion of cells that were CD206 negative but positive for one or more of the following markers: CD66b (granulocytes), CD3 (T cells), and CD19 (B cells); and (4) patient age. Patient enrollment is scheduled to begin in 2023 at up to 20 collection sites. Assuming the study is successful, we intend to submit a de novo classification request to the FDA within six months of study completion.
 
The Patient- and Physician-Friendly CyPath® Lung Process
 
CyPath® Lung is designed to be noninvasive and patient friendly. The diagnostic process uses sputum that is obtained noninvasively in the privacy of a patient’s home. Physicians order the test for their patients after lung cancer screening reveals a lung nodule considered to be indeterminate because of the nodule size and lack of suspicious characteristics. Lung nodules are considered indeterminate if their size is between 6-20 mm in diameter. Lung nodules of that size are associated with a lung cancer risk as low as 0.5% and up to 16%.7
 
For the CyPath® Lung test, patients are given a small sample collection kit during an office visit with their physician. (See Figure 1 below.) From the privacy of the patient’s home, the patient collects a sample of his or her sputum over three days using a hand-held assist device that comes in the collection kit called an acapella® Choice Blue made by Smiths Medical, which acts to break up mucus in the patient’s lung and facilitates the patient’s ability to cough up sputum from the lung into a collection cup that is also supplied with the kit. In addition to the kit’s step-by-step instructions, an instructional video and a live patient coach are available by calling 855-MYLUNGS to help patients with sample collection. With the patient’s permission, the patient coach will proactively call or text patients to offer assistance. After the three-day sample of sputum is collected in the collection cup, the patient puts the collection cup into the kit and uses a pre-addressed envelope provided in the kit to overnight the sample to the laboratory.

At the laboratory, the sputum is processed by technicians into a single-cell suspension and labeled with TCPP, which preferentially binds to cancer cells and/or cancer-related cells. Cells are also stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies that identify hematopoietic and epithelial cells within the sputum sample. A viability dye is used to eliminate dead cells. The sputum sample is analyzed using flow cytometry, which allows an average sputum sample containing about 20 million cells to be profiled in less than 20 minutes. A laboratory technician skilled in general laboratory techniques can accomplish sample processing, labeling, and data collection.
 
Physicians receive test results within three days after the laboratory receives the patient’s sputum sample. CyPath® Lung testing helps identify patients who should undergo more aggressive follow-up procedures to confirm a suspected lung cancer. When CyPath® Lung sample analysis determines a patient is unlikely or very unlikely to have lung cancer, the result can serve to support a physician’s decision to monitor this patient by following a recommended LDCT screening routine.

CyPath® Lung Research and Clinical Studies
 
The high affinity of TCPP for cancer and cancer-related cells and its fluorescent nature makes it an excellent bio-label for cancer. The CyPath® Lung technology is based on this concept and scientific work originating at Los Alamos National Laboratory in collaboration with St. Mary’s Hospital in Colorado. A blinded clinical trial8 (Patriquin, et. al, 2015) of an earlier version of CyPath® Lung used a microscope to directly identify cells labeled with TCPP in one-third or less of the sputum sample. For each trial participant, researchers manually scanned 12 microscope slides labeled with TCPP for the presence of red fluorescing cells (“RFCs”) displaying a spectral signature that indicated uptake of TCPP in the cell. In addition to measuring the spectral signature, the fluorescent intensity and cell size of RFCs were measured. The test data, including fluorescent intensity over cell size, was analyzed. The Patriquin trial was conducted over 24 months and resulted in 81% test accuracy, 77.9% sensitivity, and 65.7% specificity in the ability to correctly differentiate between samples from lung cancer patients and those at high risk who were cancer-free. The Patriquin trial required participants to provide a sputum sample and CT imaging of the lungs. Those in the cancer cohort underwent a biopsy to confirm lung cancer. High-risk patients displaying indeterminate nodules were followed for 18 months to confirm they were cancer-free. The Patriquin study concluded that optimizing the test to provide for analysis of the entire sputum sample would improve results.

CyPath® Lung is currently utilized as a diagnostic tool for detecting early-stage lung cancer. bioAffinity is conducting research for the expansion of its flow cytometric platform technology to detect and monitor lung diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma, and other cancers.
 
The Company licensed CyPath® Lung to Precision Pathology, which began marketing CyPath® Lung in Texas as an LDT in accordance with CAP/CLIA regulations pursuant to the terms of the joint development agreement between the Company and Precision Pathology. Limited funds were available to market CyPath® Lung until the Company completed its IPO in September 2022. CyPath® Lung is sold to physicians who order CyPath® Lung for patients at high risk for lung cancer after an LDCT confirms the presence of lung nodule(s).
 
As a front-end diagnostic tool used in conjunction with LDCT, the Company’s lung cancer test will help determine whether more expensive, specialized, and/or invasive tests are warranted. CyPath® Lung compares favorably to current standards of care for diagnosing lung cancer, including invasive biopsies, as seen in the table shown below.

bioAffinity’s business model is to immediately address the need for a quick-to-market, noninvasive, cost-effective lung cancer diagnostic that will save lives and reduce medical costs. The Company is ready to capture a growing market. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended doubling the number of Americans at high risk for lung cancer who are recommended for annual screening from 9 million to an estimated 18 million. China has an estimated 300 million smokers.46 The European Union is estimated to have 34 million people at high risk for lung cancer. Following its entry into the U.S. market, the Company expects to pursue CE marking of CyPath® Lung for sale in the European Union and is pursuing collaboration with a strategic partner to develop the test for the China market.
 
bioAffinity conducted market research with pulmonologists, oncologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, radiologists, and internists engaged in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer to help assess these stakeholders’ reactions to the new diagnostic, CyPath® Lung. Research revealed a strong interest in CyPath® Lung, driven by the high level of unmet clinical need for noninvasive diagnostics. A survey conducted with 240 pulmonologists and internists, the primary audience for the test, showed that 96% would use CyPath® Lung if it were available today as an adjunct used for diagnosis after LDCT screening. Physicians see the value of a noninvasive diagnostic technology with the ability to confirm or rule out cancer and reduce the number of costly invasive procedures that result from LDCT’s low positive predictive rate.
 
CyPath® Lung Business Development Plan
 
We believe in the viability of the Company’s Business Plan based on the circumstances surrounding our business that are known to us as of the date of this report. However, the timing, strategies, and stages of our Business Plan may evolve in light of new circumstances that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Our Business Plan envisions four phases of expanding market entry into the U.S., the EU, and worldwide that are timed to maximize Company resources and minimize market risk. Phase 1 of our Business Plan begins with a controlled market launch of the Company’s LDT CyPath® Lung in Texas followed by expansion into the Southwest market area. Limited marketing was undertaken prior to the IPO that provided funds necessary to begin our controlled market launch. In February 2023, the Company announced that the marketing and advertising firms of Havas Health & You and Trinity Life Sciences had been engaged to build the CyPath® Lung brand and position it for success in the cancer diagnostics sector. Havas Health & You, the world’s largest global health network, is creating the branding and broader marketing strategy to align with the need for a patient-friendly diagnostic that gives physicians another tool to assess the potential or presence of lung cancer in their high-risk patients. Trinity Life Sciences is providing advisory services, insights, and analytics to bioAffinity Technologies’ marketing strategy for CyPath® Lung. The Company expects to begin a staged nationwide expansion of sales and marketing following the successful completion of its controlled launch in 2023. Phase 2 of our Business Plan anticipates entering the EU market with CyPath® Lung as a CE-marked IVD test with sales in the Netherlands, followed by a staged EU expansion. Phase 3 of our Business Plan focuses on the marketing of an FDA-cleared CyPath® Lung test, beginning with a pivotal clinical trial in the U.S. Phase 4 of our Business Plan accelerates the market presence of CyPath® Lung in countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Australia after obtaining FDA marketing authorization in 2026.
 
At each phase of commercialization, bioAffinity Technologies will develop messaging and marketing programs, including key convention attendance, digital marketing, social media presence, and advertising, to create an “inbound” lead generation mechanism that delivers our message to our target audience. In addition, bioAffinity will collaborate with key opinion leaders (“KOLs”) to expand our third-party reference and speaking pool of experts. The Company will provide support and collateral materials, including posters, presentations, videos, and peer-reviewed papers, to our KOLs who will present data and their experience with CyPath® Lung at key meetings. This content can be shared across platforms, including websites and sales tools, and will be used as references to support our product claims as well as sales and marketing efforts to physicians, reference laboratories, and patients. We will also work with lung cancer advocacy groups throughout all phases to support the message that routine screening can diagnose cancer at an early stage and save lives.

The Competition for CyPath® Lung
 
In 2022, we evaluated 67 companies advancing tests for the early detection of lung cancer that provided at least a scientific foundation for their tests. These competitors are investigating lung cancer screening and diagnostic methods that use various types of collected samples (blood, breath, nasal epithelial cells, saliva, sputum, and urine) or imaging systems. Of those 67 companies, we found that only 11 had conducted clinical studies in a manner and with results that could lead to further analysis. The majority of these 11 tests are in research and development, with only four tests on the market and one available to a limited number of medical centers. Although CyPath® Lung was never tested directly against any of these five tests, comparison of the published performance numbers suggests CyPath® Lung might outperform them all. (See Summary of Comparative Performance Analysis of Tests on the Market, bioAffinity Technologies Internal Analysis, 2022; attached as Appendix II of the Company’s Final Prospectus (see https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1712762/000149315222024949/form424b4.htm)).
 
From the 67 companies we evaluated, we found only seven tests, including CyPath® Lung, that represent a balanced test for early lung cancer detection and that have advanced to the point that there is sufficient data for evaluation. Of our six competitors with well-balanced tests (two sell the same test; one in the U.S. and one in China), four companies (20/20 GeneSystems48,49; Nuclexi50; Savicell51; Visongate52) conducted their studies on a population that does not match the high-risk population for which the test is intended. Their clinical data, therefore, is suspect as it applies to the population of patients who actually will use the test. The two remaining balanced tests are not on the market.
 
We believe there are many reasons why CyPath® Lung is a superior test when compared to its competitors. First, lung sputum is an excellent medium for early lung cancer detection because sputum is in close contact with the tumor and pre-cancerous areas that shed cancer and pre-cancerous cells directly into the sputum, can be obtained noninvasively, and can be transported easily. Moreover, sputum contains immune cell populations in reaction to the presence of a tumor. Second, bioAffinity’s proprietary technology is straightforward. bioAffinity’s CyPath® Lung platform technology is not a molecular test and does not collect genetic material that requires immediate processing. CyPath® Lung uses well-established flow cytometry techniques to investigate cells contained in the sputum for characteristics that indicate whether cancer is present. Sample processing is straightforward, and laboratory technicians can be easily trained. Reagents used by the test are widely available. Data acquisition and analysis is fully automated, allowing for efficient test results. Third, CyPath® Lung has shown high specificity and sensitivity that is similar to far more invasive and more expensive procedures currently used to detect lung cancer. Fourth, CyPath® Lung is cost effective. Existing CPT cost codes that have a reimbursable track record have been identified for use with CyPath. Fifth and as important as any of our test’s benefits, CyPath® Lung is patient friendly, providing at-home sample collection that is noninvasive and offers particular benefit during a public healthcare crisis like the coronavirus pandemic.

Research and Development Activities
 
The Company is continuing its research and development activities pertaining to diagnostics that include multiple studies we believe will support FDA final approval of CyPath® Lung, which we will seek after the pivotal trial is complete. Our scientists also have begun preliminary studies toward the development of CyPath® Lung for detection of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and the assay’s use with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). With regard to therapeutic research, the Company continues its experiments focused on establishing proof-of-concept for our discovery that the silencing or knockdown of two genes that each encode a cell surface receptor results in cancer death without much harm to healthy cells with the intent of advancing toward animal studies.
