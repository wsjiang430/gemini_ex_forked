Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Sustainable Projects Group Inc. (“SPGX,” “we,” “us,” our” or the “Company”) is a pure-play lithium company focused on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast-growing electric vehicle (“EV”) and broader battery markets. We have developed a proprietary technology to extract lithium from oilfield wastewater, which we believe will enable us to manufacture lithium compounds quickly, at an attractive cost, and with a minimal environmental footprint, which we expect to provide us with a competitive advantage over other lithium manufacturers. We believe this competitive advantage will enable us to capitalize on the acceleration of vehicle electrification and renewable energy adoption.
 
We plan to establish our first lithium carbonate manufacturing facility in 2023, which we anticipate will be capable of manufacturing up to 1,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”), and we plan to begin manufacturing battery-grade lithium compounds at such facility in the first half of 2024.
 
On February 14, 2023, SPGX entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Lithium Harvest ApS, a Denmark private limited liability company (“Lithium Harvest”), and all of the shareholders of Lithium Harvest (the “Shareholders”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Lithium Harvest in exchange for issuing to the Shareholders 206,667,233 shares of SPGX’s common stock (the “Exchange Transaction”). The Exchange Transaction closed on February 14, 2023.
 
Prior to the Exchange Transaction, SPGX was a business development company engaged in project development and holdings through value-based investments and collaborative partnerships, including a joint venture relationship with Hero Wellness Systems Inc. (“Hero Wellness”) and a purchase agreement with the inventors of the Soy-yer Dough product line. During September 2022, SPGX decided to exit the joint venture with Hero Wellness, and following the Exchange Transaction, SPGX has not made concrete plans on expansion of the Soy-yer Dough project.

Our Technology and Products
 
Direct Lithium Extraction Technology. Our Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) technology enables us to extract and manufacture lithium compounds from oilfield wastewater in a few hours. Competing technologies typically extract and manufacture lithium compounds from brine or hard rock through processes that take up to two to three years. Our DLE technology also allows us to adjust production according to customer needs, which we believe puts us in a favorable position to meet growing demand.
 
Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Hydroxide. We plan to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide for use in high performance lithium-ion batteries for EVs and broader battery markets. We plan to produce both standardized and customer specific compounds.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
To fully capitalize on the growing demand for lithium compounds, our growth strategy will involve continued investment in manufacturing facilities, research and development, and our people. Essential features of our growth strategy include:

● | Build and expand manufacturing capacities. We plan to establish our first lithium carbonate manufacturing facility in 2023, which we anticipate will be capable of manufacturing up to 1,000 metric tons of LCE, and we plan to begin manufacturing battery-grade lithium compounds at such facility in the first half of 2024. We plan to continue to invest in manufacturing capacity and aim to have a total manufacturing capacity in excess of 6,000 metric tons of LCE by the end of 2026. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enter new geographic areas and expand North American operations. We believe that U.S. and international governments will increasingly support the local and sustainable production of critical minerals, including lithium compounds, for the green energy transition. Our first lithium carbonate manufacturing facility is planned to be established in Texas, and we intend to continue to expand our operations in North America in the near term, and eventually expand to Europe. 
● | Continued investment in research and development and the expansion of our product portfolio. We believe that the continued evolution of battery technologies will require new forms of lithium to be produced. To ensure that we are well-positioned to develop new products to keep pace with the evolving battery technology industry, we plan to continue to focus and invest in research and development. Further, we plan to utilize our proprietary technology to expand our product portfolio to also include nickel, magnesium and vanadium. 
● | Focus on sustainability. We believe that lithium will continue to be an important component of the green energy transition. Likewise, we believe that there will be a continued and increased focus on responsible lithium production and the Environmental, Social and Governance issues and concerns related to the production of lithium. Operating in a socially conscious, ethical, safe and sustainable manner is reflected in our core values. Further, we believe that our DLE technology has the lowest environmental footprint of any lithium extraction technology in the industry. We believe that our sustainable extraction technology and our local manufacturing will differentiate us from our competitors and help us build important strategic relationships with customers and other stakeholders. 
● | Invest in our people. Our business depends on highly specialized research scientists, engineers, a technical sales force and experienced management. We are committed to investing in our people through training and development. We aim to attract and retain talent by cultivating an inclusive and positive working environment that creates and supports diversity and provides equal opportunity and fairness in our management systems. 

Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe the following strengths underpin our ability to grow our business and profitability:
 

● | Direct Lithium Extraction. Our DLE technology enables us to extract and manufacture lithium compounds from oilfield wastewater in a few hours. Competing technologies typically extract and manufacture lithium compounds from brine and hard rock through a process that takes up to two to three years. Our DLE technology also allows us to adjust production according to customer needs, which we believe puts us in a favorable position to meet growing demand. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Stable and readily available lithium feedstock. We use our DLE technology to produce high performance lithium compounds from oilfield wastewater (also referred to as “produced water”). The global oil and gas industry produces more than 250 million barrels of produced water per day, which will provide a stable supply of lithium feedstock. Further, our DLE technology does not require us to acquire land and obtain drilling permits, which we believe will allow us to establish new lithium operations and ramp production much quicker than our competitors.

● | Low capital expenditure. Because our DLE technology does not require us to acquire land and obtain drilling permits, we believe that we can establish lithium operations at a lower cost than our competitors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low operating expenses. We believe that our operating expenses will be competitive with any other technology used in the industry. Our manufacturing facilities will use a high degree of automation, which we expect to lower our operating expenses. Our lithium compounds are produced from a waste product and will be extracted, refined and packaged in the same facility, which we believe will lower our costs for transportation. 
● | Local manufacturing. We plan to produce our products as close to our customers as possible. We believe that governments will be increasingly focused on the local supply of critical minerals, and recent regulatory developments in our geographical focus areas strongly incentivize battery and vehicle manufacturers to source locally produced lithium products. 
● | Sustainable production. We produce our lithium compounds from oilfield wastewater. More than 90% of all water used in our production is cleaned and reused. We believe that we will have the lowest environmental footprint in the industry, and we believe that customers and end-users will be increasingly focused on sustainable manufacturing of battery materials. We believe that our low environmental footprint will position us favorably against competitors using more traditional lithium extraction technologies. 

Our Market
 
The market for battery grade lithium compounds is global, and we plan to sell our products worldwide. Based on estimates by Benchmark Minerals, lithium demand is forecasted to rise from 350,000 tons in 2020 to 2.5 million tons in 2030 and over 7 million tons in 2040, with a positive long-term price trend estimate of $15,000 per ton for battery-grade Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Hydroxide from 2025 to 2040. We believe that the continued electrification of transportation and transition to renewable energy sources will support continued significant growth in demand for lithium compounds over the next decade.
Raw Materials
 
Lithium
 
We produce our lithium products from oilfield wastewater. The annual global production of produced water is more than 250 million barrels per day. The U.S. production of produced water is more than 50 million barrels per day. Not all produced water is suitable for lithium production, but we estimate that the current U.S. production of produced water is sufficient to produce more than 500,000 metric tons of LCE annually.
 
We plan to enter into long-term supply agreements with oil and gas companies and service providers for the supply of produced water.
 
Water
 
All fresh water used in our production will be reused water from the production of oil and natural gas. We do not require any additional fresh water supplies.
Energy
 
Our production relies on a steady source of energy. We expect to use solar energy to the extent possible, but we will require an external supply of energy for our equipment.
 
Other raw materials
 
We use a range of raw materials and chemicals intermediates in our production processes. We generally expect to satisfy our requirements through spot purchases but likely will rely on medium-to-long-term agreements for the supply of certain raw materials.

--------------------------------+-----------+-------


Generally, we are not expecting supply chain constraints, but temporary shortages of certain raw materials may occur and cause temporary price increases. During periods of high demand, our raw materials are subject to significant price fluctuations that may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, there could be inflationary pressure on the costs of raw materials.
 
Competition
 
Our products will compete with other lithium compounds available in the market. Many of our competitors are large companies with long-term experience in the industry. The market for battery grade lithium compounds faces barriers to entry, including access to a stable and sufficient supply of lithium feedstock, the ability to produce a sufficient quality and quantity of lithium, technical know-how, and sufficient lead time to develop new lithium mining projects. We believe that our DLE technology enables us to produce high quality products quickly, at an attractive cost, and with a minimal environmental footprint, which we believe will differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to further improve our products, develop new products, and build market share.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our DLE technology and the intellectual property rights related to our DLE technology. On December 15, 2022 we received an “Intention to Grant” notification from the Danish Patent and Trademark Office. We expect the Danish patent to be granted in the first quarter of 2023. Further, we have a pending application for a U.S. patent. If granted, these patents will expire in 2042.
Customers
 
We intend to sell our products to customers in the EV and broader battery markets, and plan to initially sell lithium locally to customers in the regions close to our manufacturing facilities.
Sales and Marketing
 
We intend to initially sell our products directly to customers in the U.S. and anticipate that we will subsequently sell our products to customers throughout North America, Asia and Europe.
Manufacturing
 
We intend to manufacture the lithium compounds we extract at our own facilities. We intend to construct our first commercial manufacturing facility in 2023.
 
Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development to optimize our DLE technology and our lithium products and to develop new product candidates and technologies.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operations are generally not impacted by seasonality. However, production is expected to be marginally lower during the summer due to the U.S. vacation season.
 
Government Controls and Regulations
 
We are subject to and will incur capital and operating costs to comply with U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing employee health and safety, the composition of our products, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.
 
In June 2016, modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act in the United States were signed into law, requiring chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. Other initiatives in Asia and potentially in other regions will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products.

To the extent we manufacture or import products into the European Union (“EU”) or downstream users of our products are located in the EU, we may be subject to the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). REACH imposes obligations on EU manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the EU to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Currently, certain lithium products are undergoing a risk assessment review under REACH, which may eventually result in restrictions in the handling or use of lithium carbonate and other lithium products that we produce, which may increase our production costs. In addition, REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities and costs on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. REACH, if applicable to the sale or manufacture of our products, may lead to increases in the costs of raw materials we may purchase and the products we may sell in the EU, which could increase the costs of our products and result in a decrease in their overall demand.
 
We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims and substantial liability for personal injury, property damage, wrongful death, loss of production, pollution and other environmental damages relating to the release of such substances into the environment. Depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents, it is possible that the Company’s revenues, operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators could be impaired.
 
Human Capital Management
 
We had eight full-time employees as of March 1, 2023. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are a party to a collective bargaining arrangement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
