 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are focused on advancing precision medicine and drug discovery through our innovative transcriptome-wide profiling and advanced drug discovery platform technologies. Building on more than a decade of pioneering innovation, our proprietary next-generation HTG EdgeSeq technology is the basis for our tech-driven hybrid business model allowing our RNA molecular profiling applications to be more effective, efficient and relevant and also serving as a key component of the engine behind our platform-based drug discovery process. Central to our business strategy is our drug discovery engine, which uses our captive transcriptomic profiling capabilities combined with a proprietary medicinal chemistry machine learning platform to render an artificial intelligence ("AI") -driven drug candidate optimization platform. We are using this platform to innovate drug discovery with the goal of building best-in-class molecules for known pharmacologic targets across multiple disease areas, better, faster and in a more cost-effective manner.
The training data sets for our machine learning platform utilize our own primary data generated specifically for this purpose. This high quality, standardized data provides a clear advantage over other platform approaches which are typically dependent upon publicly available data. The medicinal chemistry portion of our platform allows for rapid design and in silico evaluation of large chemical libraries in order to prioritize and select compounds for synthesis and advancement into early testing. These data are then integrated and processed into an iterative loop using a series of proprietary machine learning algorithms prior to further advancing the molecules to more traditional drug discovery studies. We expect that this will allow for rapid identification, selection and optimization of drug candidates for entrance into development. Further, we believe that our ability to rapidly iterate between primary data and computational analyses gives us valuable information and insights for candidate molecule design and selection.
To date, we have used our transcriptome-informed drug discovery engine to develop an early pipeline of drug candidate molecules for two known pharmacologic targets, both of which can target several potential therapeutic indications, but with a current focus on oncology and neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that our technology provides a differentiated and potentially disruptive approach to drug discovery, that may allow ourselves and our partners to potentially improve upon key attrition factors, namely efficacy and toxicity, early in the discovery process, thereby allowing for better chances for candidate success when entering development.
 Our business strategy is to build our drug discovery pipeline in order to out-license certain drug candidates and carry other candidates into preclinical and early development ourselves. In addition, we would expect to retain and potentially capitalize upon clinical diagnostics ("CDx") rights through the clinical development and commercialization of these assets where appropriate.
 We also operate a profiling business in life science tools. Our profiling product and service solutions enable targeted RNA profiling using a small amount of biological sample, in liquid or solid forms. Our menu of HTG EdgeSeq assays, including our HTG Transcriptome Panel ("HTP"), which has been designed to measure approximately 20,000 mRNA targets using our HTG EdgeSeq technology, is automated on our HTG EdgeSeq system, which applies NGS tools, enabling the generation of gene expression data in a timely manner utilizing our simplified workflow. We seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling for biomarker analysis and diagnostics, including the acceleration of precision medicine, the migration of molecular testing to NGS-based applications, the movement to smaller and less invasive biopsies, the need for greater diagnostic sensitivity, the need to conform to challenging healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow, including simplified bioinformatics. These capabilities enable customers to extend the use of limited biological samples for retrospective or prospective analysis, gaining further understanding of the molecular drivers of disease with the goal of developing biomarker-driven targeted therapies.


 Our existing products include instruments, consumables and software that, as an integrated platform, automate sample processing and can quickly, robustly and simultaneously profile hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of molecular targets from samples which are a fraction of the size required by many prevailing technologies. Customers can access our technology by purchasing our HTG EdgeSeq system and assays for their internal use or through our Tucson, Arizona-based VERI/O service laboratory, including molecular profiling of cohorts and development of custom research use only ("RUO") panels to support early-stage clinical programs and investigational-use-only assays for clinical trials. However, with the release of our HTP, revenue from our RUO assay design services is expected to be lower than historical levels, as our RUO assay design services revenue is replaced by HTP consumables purchases and sample processing laboratory services using our HTP. Our product and service solutions have enabled us to access a number of early-stage biomarker discovery programs. We believe this approach will enable new opportunities collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies in their future drug development programs.
Our Strategy
 Our objective is to establish our transcriptome-informed drug discovery process as the preferred methodology for small molecule drug discovery and our HTG EdgeSeq technology as the standard in profiling and CDx development.
The key components of our strategy are:
 •Leverage our existing capabilities in transcriptomic profiling, machine learning chemical library design and AI-driven drug candidate optimization to build a portfolio of best-in-class small molecule drug candidates for known targets. We are focused on improving the existing drug discovery process by using our proprietary technologies. We intend to use our transcriptomic profiling technologies, integrated with a machine learning-based chemical library design platform, to better-inform the design and selection of drug candidate molecules, resulting in candidates that are expected to have lower risk profiles and increased opportunities for development success. We believe that, in addition to being a better way to develop drug candidates, this approach will be faster and less expensive than traditional approaches. We plan to use models to identify drug candidates that may either be out-licensed to drug development partners at early stages of development or potentially retained internally for progression into later stages of development, in an effort to further increase the value of the assets prior to licensing or partnering. 
 •Leverage our existing transcriptome-based drug candidate optimization capabilities to partner with other biopharma companies. The same advantages that we intend to bring to our own discovery efforts would also benefit other biopharma companies. In disease areas or indications outside our primary targets, we intend to partner our proprietary transcriptome-informed platform technology to expand our drug discovery opportunity through collaborations that may provide non-dilutive capital.
 •Re-establish companion diagnostic collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies potentially informed by HTG Therapeutics efforts in the future. Collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies with late-stage drug development programs have the potential to create additional companion diagnostic consumables revenue. We believe our historical experience with these collaborative arrangements coupled with our plans to improve upon the existing drug discovery processes through HTG Therapeutics can inform and drive future collaborative development programs with drug candidate molecules that are intrinsically lower risk and have a greater potential for success in development than those involved in our past collaborative development services agreements. 
 •Expand our position in translational medicine with our RUO molecular profiling products. We believe the market for gene expression analysis for translational medicine is large and growing. We have built targeted panels in oncology, immuno-oncology, immune response and microRNA that enable scientists to observe gene expression patterns to identify molecular subtypes, study key pathways and discover and validate biomarker hypotheses to help drive precision medicine. In 2020, we expanded the utility of these panels by adding new applications to interrogate the tumor micro-environment, such as tumor inflammation and immunophenotyping signatures in our HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software. In 2021, we further expanded our product offerings and capabilities with the release of our HTP, allowing customers to measure approximately 20,000 mRNA targets from the human transcriptome. Our HTP enables faster gene expression analysis of the transcriptome using significantly less sample input and allows for profiling of lower quality samples as compared to conventional testing methods. We believe this product may facilitate the expansion of our target customer base outside of oncology and autoimmune and into markets such as diabetes, cardiology and neurology.
 •Continue to establish our systems workflow as the best solution for RNA clinical sequencing. We intend to continue to establish our technology as the optimal complementary workflow with next-generation sequencers. We believe our differentiated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry will accelerate adoption of RNA biomarkers by leveraging the large and growing installed base of next-generation sequencers. We are engaged with industry and corporate partners, including Illumina, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. to position our HTG EdgeSeq products as the benchmark for workflow in targeted sequencing applications.


Our Market Opportunities
 Drug Discovery for the Biopharmaceutical Sector
 The transitional drug discovery and development process is characterized by substantial financial risks for development programs that often fail to reach patients as marketed products. Historically, it has taken over ten years and average capitalized research and development costs of over $2.0 billion per approved medicine to move a drug discovery project from early discovery to an approved therapeutic. Such productivity outcomes have culminated in an expected industry success rate of 8% to 14% from discovery to commercialization, yielding a rapidly declining internal rate of return for the industry from approximately 10% in 2010 to 2.5% in 2020.
  These trends create an environment that is ripe for technological innovation. Traditional drug discovery relies on basic research discoveries from the scientific community for disease-relevant pathways and targets to interrogate. Frequently, drug developers are left to make decisions on potential candidates without fully understanding the incredible complexity of systems biology. Despite decades of accumulated knowledge, the result is that drug discovery has unintentionally become almost artisanal, with little informative biological data available to those in the industry.
  In an attempt to address these issues, the biopharmaceutical sector has increasingly relied on the “open science” model whereby companies pursue a diverse set of strategies leveraging internal research and development efforts as well as turning to external research and development, scientific collaborations and in-licensing opportunities to advance new drug discoveries, meet currently unmet needs and help more patients. Fully integrated pharmaceutical companies have evolved to use open science as a ground to supplement their internal pipeline efforts with new drug candidates and/or new emerging technologies. It is not uncommon among the fully integrated companies to have strategic goals where half of the pipeline is from internal efforts whereas the remaining half is populated through assets that are either in-licensed, partnered or acquired through strategic acquisitions. Some fully integrated pharmaceutical companies rely solely on external science and innovation.
 We believe that our approach of utilizing our established RNA profiling capabilities, integrated into a drug discovery platform with advanced medicinal chemistry technologies, will result in more well-informed molecule design and selection and potentially provide multiple revenue opportunities. These revenue opportunities may include collaboration or licensing arrangements for any small molecule drug candidates we generate, either at early- or mid-stage development, potentially out-licensing our technology to pharmaceutical companies to enable them to implement our advanced drug discovery approach into their own internal discovery efforts and developing new companion diagnostic assays to support the related clinical development programs for those molecules.
 Cancer Molecular Profiling and Genomics in Life Science Research
 Molecular profiling is the analysis of biomarkers, including DNA, RNA and protein, in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood and other biofluids, to identify gene expression patterns or genomic changes. The HTG EdgeSeq technology coupled with NGS is making it possible to perform these characterizations in unprecedented ways, resulting in a shift from the traditional approach of looking at one target at a time to the simultaneous analysis of potentially tens, hundreds or thousands of gene targets.
Among what we believe are the most promising applications of molecular profiling is the targeted sequencing of RNA from patient samples to identify gene expression patterns or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. These applications have launched a fundamental shift towards personalized medicine where an individual patient’s molecular profile is used to guide treatment.
The market for RNA-Seq is estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion and growing annually at 10-20%. The gene expression component of that market is estimated to be approximately $820.0 million and growing at the same rate. With these metrics in mind, we expect our target market, NGS-based gene expression profiling, to be between $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion by 2024.
Therapy Driven Diagnostics - Companion Diagnostics
 The World Health Organization estimates that cancer will lead to the deaths of approximately 17 million people per year by 2030. As a result, biopharmaceutical companies are aggressively deploying biomarker driven strategies to improve the response rates to drugs, including existing drugs, new drugs and combination therapies. These companies are looking for technology solutions that can more effectively identify the biological root causes of disease and aid the discovery of biomarkers to better develop and target drugs to the correct patients. The companion diagnostic market is currently estimated at $2.6 billion and growing approximately 20% annually. We believe that the acceleration of investment into immunotherapy drugs will also be a catalyst for future companion diagnostics for combination therapies where RNA gene expression classification is expected to be important.


When a molecular biomarker panel is used for selection of patients in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new drug, the drug and biomarker test are often submitted to the applicable regulatory agency for approval together. In the United States, upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval or clearance of the CDx test, the patient must be tested with the CDx test prior to being treated with the drug. Companion diagnostic tests have a clear clinical utility that generally supports favorable reimbursement decisions. We believe there are currently approximately 3,100 oncology clinical trials, approximately 24% of which are interrogating RNA. This percentage has more than doubled since 2014, and we believe this percentage will approach 50% by 2025.
Our Technology
 HTG has assembled a portfolio of technology platforms to provide highly differentiated capabilities to serve our two business areas. These technologies are as follows and are described in further detail below:
•HTG EdgeSeq profiling technology provides robust whole transcriptome gene expression analysis with high plex and sensitivity; 
 •HTG EdgeSeq instrumentation to automate our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry, enabling high volume sample processing and improved reproducibility;
 •Advanced machine learning-driven medicinal chemistry platform for rapid construction of libraries to known targets; and 
 •AI-driven medicinal chemistry platform to iterate chemical structures to transcriptomic data to optimize drug candidate design and selection.
 
Platform Technology for Drug Discovery
 
HTG EdgeSeq Profiling Technology
 Our HTG EdgeSeq profiling technology measures RNA using DNA nuclease protection probes ("DNA protection probes"). These DNA protection probes include a target-specific region flanked by universal wing sequences and are hybridized in solution to their target RNAs. Target RNA can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. Universal DNA wingmen are hybridized to the wings to prevent S1 nuclease digestion. S1 nuclease is added to remove single-stranded nucleic acids, including unhybridized DNA protection probes and RNA. Following S1 nuclease treatment, the only remaining DNA protection probes in the reaction are those hybridized to targeted RNA and wingmen to form a hybridized heteroduplex. This produces an approximately 1:1 ratio of DNA protection probes to the RNA targeted in the sample. DNA protection probes are labeled with sequencing adaptors and molecular barcodes in a PCR reaction. The labeled DNA protection probes are cleaned up, quantified, pooled, and ready for sequencing using standard NGS protocols. Data from the NGS instrument is processed and reported by the parser software provided with the HTG EdgeSeq platform.


Key Advantages of our HTG EdgeSeq Profiling Technology
 •Multiplexing tens, hundreds or thousands of gene targets. Measuring multiple genes in a single reaction can be challenging with competitive technologies due to the complex interactions of reaction components. With our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry, we can profile almost 22,000 genes using a single panel. The high level of gene multiplexing allows for significantly lower amounts of tissue to be used per sample than in competitive low-plex profiling technologies.
 •No RNA extraction. Competitive technologies for assessing RNA generally require RNA that is isolated and purified from the sample. These time-consuming steps may lead to some RNA loss and bias the test outcome. In formalin fixed paraffin embedded (“FFPE”) tissues, for example, it has been reported that a fraction of the RNA is lost in the purification process because it cannot be separated from insoluble tissue components and the fixation and embedding process or long storage times for FFPE tissue may damage the RNA and break it into smaller, more difficult to analyze fragments. This makes molecular profiling of small FFPE tissues particularly challenging and can result in testing failures and loss of precious samples due to insufficient RNA yield. These biases introduced by RNA extraction cannot be overcome and may be propagated throughout the subsequent analysis. Our proprietary chemistry does not require RNA extraction for FFPE samples or most other sample types (we recommend extracting RNA from fresh-frozen tissue samples to prevent processing variability) and improves utilization of precious samples, thereby improving workflow and reducing costs by eliminating a step known to bias the data.
 •No cDNA synthesis. Many competitive technologies, most prominently RT-quantitative PCR (“RT-qPCR”) and traditional RNA sequencing, require conversion of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) for analysis. When damaged and fragmented RNA is used, these small RNA strands become increasingly difficult to convert into cDNA in an accurate and reproducible manner. Our proprietary chemistry does not require conversion of the RNA to cDNA by reverse transcription, removing a technical difficulty experienced with competitive technologies.
 •Short protection probes. Many samples contain RNA degraded by various combinations of storage conditions, age, poor processing, and fixation. In these samples, the RNA is damaged and fragmented into smaller strands. Utilizing short protection probes of 50 bases or less, we believe our proprietary chemistry is more efficient than competitive technologies that require longer strands of RNA for quantitation.
 •Simplicity. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. Compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the accumulation of these steps required by other technologies results in the introduction of biases, sample degradation and increased opportunities for operator error.
 HTG Instrument Platform
 Our instrument and assays were developed internally and are manufactured in Tucson, AZ under ISO 13485:2016 certified procedures using our proprietary HTG EdgeSeq chemistry to simplify multiplexed nucleic acid testing in research and clinical laboratories. The entire workflow from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in as few as 36 hours for 96 samples. With the speed, flexibility, sensitivity, and accuracy of our HTG EdgeSeq platform, combined with the system’s ability to work effectively with small sample volumes, researchers can profile tens, hundreds or thousands of different genes per sample.
 


The HTG EdgeSeq platform consists of a processor (shown above), a host computer and integrated software. The processor is a fully automated instrument that prepares biological samples for quantitation using proprietary, electronically barcoded, single-use consumables. The instrument has barcode scanner units to process the two-dimensional barcodes printed on the consumables loaded into the instrument. The barcoded consumables are single-use to reduce operator errors, eliminate cross-contamination and provide chain of custody traceability for the samples. The robotic liquid handling within the instrument is engineered for reliable performance and low maintenance. The walking path of the robot is programmed to minimize any chance of contamination of the reagents or samples. One host computer supports up to six processors allowing laboratories to easily expand their capacity by adding processors.
 Applications of our HTG EdgeSeq technology combine the HTG EdgeSeq platform with a NGS platform to enable the quantitative analysis of hundreds or thousands of RNA targets in a single panel. The sample library is prepared on the processor, then labeled with molecular sequencing adaptors and tags. The labeled samples are cleaned up, quantified, pooled, and sequenced on a NGS platform using standard protocols. Data from the NGS instrument are processed and reported by the parser software included with the system. HTG EdgeSeq panels are currently available to process from one to 96 samples in a single batch.
In addition to direct sales of our systems, we utilize several alternative arrangements to provide customer access to our platform. Our platform can be purchased directly by our customers, who also then purchase HTG EdgeSeq assays and other consumables from us on an as-needed basis. In some instances, we provide our instruments free of charge on a limited basis to facilitate customer evaluation prior to acquisition. We also may choose to install instruments for our customers at no cost, in exchange for an agreement to purchase assays and other consumables from us at a stated price and volume over the term of the agreement or allow customers to rent our instrument for a monthly fee.
Our Drug Discovery Engine
  Currently, approximately 90% of drugs fail in clinical development due to insufficient efficacy and/or safety issues and, in many instances, these issues are not revealed until considerable time has passed and tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in the discovery and development stages of these programs. Through key learnings from our prior collaborative development services experiences, we have designed a new approach to drug discovery that leverages the benefits of our HTP and epitranscriptomic profiling technologies in RNA profiling, sequencing and other scientific applications, including drug discovery and development. We believe the competitive advantages provided by our technology, compared with other profiling technologies, are the ability to process smaller sample volumes of multiple sample types with faster turnaround times and a simplified workflow.
 In June 2021, we announced the formation of HTG Therapeutics, with the addition of several highly experienced drug development professionals to our leadership team. Throughout 2021, we strengthened our HTG EdgeSeq technology platform and added new profiling capabilities, including epitranscriptomic profiling, which currently provides the capability to generate over 40,000 biological data points from each experimental sample. By leveraging these profiling technologies in the drug discovery process, integrated with an advanced AI and machine learning-based medicinal chemistry approach, we have established a novel transcriptome-informed small molecule discovery engine at the core of our HTG Therapeutics business unit which we believe will generate drug candidate molecules that are intrinsically lower risk and will have greater potential for clinical development success when compared to currently existing early-stage drug discovery methods in the biopharmaceutical industry. We further expect that this approach to small molecule discovery can be applied agnostically across therapeutic areas and is scalable and flexible, allowing us to adapt our strategic and therapeutic focus rapidly as new information emerges on the pathogenesis of diseases.



 We believe that our approach will potentially provide multiple revenue opportunities, including collaboration or out-licensing arrangements for small molecule drug candidates we generate from as early as lead optimization through early preclinical development, the out-licensing of our technology to pharmaceutical companies to enable them to implement our advanced drug discovery approach into their own internal discovery efforts, and potentially new companion diagnostic opportunities to support the related clinical development programs for molecules that are brought forward through this novel discovery approach.
 In the first half of 2022, we released a series of white papers after demonstrating the utility of our proprietary technologies as a key component of our novel transcriptome-informed drug discovery and design approach and applying the approach to our initial therapeutic target. As anticipated, the results of our studies summarized in these white papers supported our approach and its ability to reveal indication-specific effects and potential undesirable effects in our first target through analysis of transcriptomic profiles from compound-treated human cell line test systems.
 Throughout the second half of 2022, we continued to work to strengthen our drug discovery core platform technology, including advancing the machine learning component of our platform with the refinement of key proprietary algorithms while continuing to generate our own internal data supporting training sets. In addition, we made capital investments to establish internal cell culture capabilities to support the expansion of our cell-based test system models. Our medicinal chemistry effort has produced a series of chemical libraries for our first target, and our most advanced library for this target has entered preclinical characterization, with a series of data generated including early efficacy in two different disease states.
 As a result of the progress made throughout 2022, we filed a patent application in December 2022, which included claims directed toward specific compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating or preventing disease by administration of the compounds. Our initial therapeutic pipeline is focused on oncology and degenerative neuroscience, emphasizing pharmacologic targets with understood roles in the progression of diseases in these areas.
 The most advanced discovery program in oncology is a small molecule program for treatment of liquid tumors. We expect to continue lead optimization of this program through the end of the first quarter of 2023, with advancement to support entry into preclinical development later in the year. HTG Therapeutics has a second oncology directed small molecule program for the treatment of a solid tumor type that is nearing completion in the hit-to-lead discovery phase, with lead optimization efforts planned through the second quarter of 2023 and subsequent preparation for potential preclinical development expected by the end of 2023. In our neuroscience pipeline, we have completed early discovery stage efforts and chemical library generation for candidate small molecules for application to neurodegenerative conditions which are expected to enter the hit-to-lead phase in the second half of 2023.


 We expect to initiate several early discovery-stage programs evaluating small molecule candidates against a variety of different cancers, from which we plan to select candidates for additional indications to continually expand our drug discovery pipeline. As additional candidates are identified, we may choose to retain certain candidates internally to be advanced through early development, with the intention to increase the value of these pipeline assets before moving to license or partner for further development. In parallel to these therapy-area specific programs, we continue to enrich the proprietary dataset that supports our transcriptome-informed drug discovery platform and to evolve and refine the complementary AI and machine learning portions of our drug discovery engine throughout these discovery processes. Finally, we would expect to maintain the exclusive rights and the opportunity to solely develop new CDx assays relating to these drug candidates as they move through the increasingly advanced stages of development with our future collaboration partners, further growing our existing gene expression profiling business.
Our Competitive Advantages
 We believe that our proprietary technologies provide us with a number of competitive advantages that set us apart from others in our industry and that will continue to drive new customers toward our solutions.
 In drug discovery, we intend to use our captive transcriptomic profiling capabilities combined with our captive medicinal chemistry capabilities to create an AI driven drug candidate optimization process. Differentiation begins with our profiling capability. Our HTG EdgeSeq technology uses very little sample, has a high sample pass rate and high sensitivity, uses an automated workflow and produces high quality data in under three days for hundreds of samples at a time. This enables us to use high quality primary transcriptomic data as an input to analyze the biological response of cells to individual molecules in candidate chemical libraries. We believe competing profiling technologies are not as robust, are more variable and take significantly longer to generate data.


A further point of differentiation is our chemistry platform. A combination of cheminformatics, molecular docking and machine learning algorithms allow for building and refinement of compound libraries in silico, rapidly generating highly focused compound libraries for specific targets. These small molecule-focused libraries are screened using traditional methods and via molecular profiling, allowing for rapid feedback into the compound design system for optimization of lead compounds. All compound molecules, along with their attendant data, are added to HTG's proprietary compound library.

The key element of our drug discovery engine is a machine learning ‘conversation’ between several data sources, including our proprietary transcriptomic data and the chemical structures of the compound used to generate the data. Additional data sources include pre-trained data from multiple databases for RNA and protein biology, pathway analysis, compound properties and compound structures. Data that we are generating are continually being added and experimental data from our compound libraries will be used in an effort to optimize the design and selection of potential drug candidates for considerations based on transcriptomic indicators related to efficacy and safety. Our drug discovery engine is designed and built to be a modular and highly scalable set of machine learning algorithms, with the flexibility to incorporate cutting-edge techniques in this rapidly-changing area.

In molecular profiling, our products and services are designed to work with many different biological sample types, can generate robust results from very small samples, and obviate the need for many of the sample-preparation steps associated with traditional molecular techniques. Our platform and assays enable the simultaneous detection and quantitation of tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets and are capable of profiling multiple parameters such as RNA expression levels, RNA-expressed gene fusions and RNA modifications in a single testing workflow that can use NGS detection for quantitative measurement.
 We believe we are well positioned with the following key product benefits:
 •Optimize sample utilization. Our platform can analyze several thousand genes from extremely small sample volumes such as a single five-micron section of tissue or 15 microliters of plasma or serum. With the launch of our transcriptome panel, the analysis plex increases 10 times, while maintaining minimal sample input requirements. Our technology allows customers to do more with less, which meets the needs of clinical or pre-clinical laboratories where there is often not enough patient sample to do all the testing desired. We believe providing customers the ability to work with extremely small sample volumes will be a driver of adoption of our technology and systems.
 •Compatibility with multiple sample types. Our proprietary technology allows customers to profile and unlock molecular information from a wide variety of biological samples such as FFPE tissue, cultured cells, and blood-based sample types such as PAXgene, serum and plasma. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to profile these and other sample types and believe we ultimately can profile most clinically relevant sample types, including cell-free circulating nucleic acids from tumors, a rapidly developing area of investigation which is referred to as a liquid biopsy. We believe that the capabilities of our technology will allow us to efficiently expand applications, regardless of sample type.
 •Flexible and adaptable chemistry allows for use in multiple applications. We believe our proprietary chemistry provides the ability to measure a variety of molecular targets in many necessary applications, including RNA expression levels and expressed RNA gene rearrangements (such as gene fusions and insertions), and offers the ability to quantify these applications on a variety of NGS platforms. This flexibility provides customers the ability to optimize their use of our technologies based on their specific throughput, workflow and application needs. Our proprietary chemistry is comparatively simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. For example, compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, among other library preparation steps. We believe that the elimination of these steps helps prevent biases associated with these steps, sample degradation and opportunities for operator error.
 •Robust data. Molecular profiling produces large amounts of information that is used, among other things, to make important decisions, such as identifying potential drug targets or selecting a patient for a therapeutic treatment. This information is valuable only to the extent it accurately represents the true biology of the test sample and can be replicated under many different conditions. Our chemistry is highly specific and sensitive, meaning it can detect the right target even when very little is present in the sample. Our system produces consistent results on a replicate-to-replicate, day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument basis.
 •Automation provides superior workflow and ease of use. Our technology is designed with fewer workflow steps in part due to the elimination of the need for complex sample-preparation processes such as extraction, cDNA synthesis, selection, depletion and shearing. This enables customers to limit hands-on time and the need for specialized skills, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 36 hours. Additionally, our HTG EdgeSeq platform further integrates sample preparation for targeted sequencing and greatly simplifies the data bioinformatics, so customers looking to leverage their NGS instrument can seamlessly add this capability to their current workflows.
 •Simplified bioinformatics. Our HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software provides data in a simple and easy to use format through a simple graphical user interface that is flexible for researchers and can be used to deliver patient reports. The HTG EdgeSeq parser software, which processes the data generated from the NGS platform, is modular so that new panels can be added without changes to the underlying software or hardware. We believe the simplicity of our bioinformatics solution will help drive the adoption of our platform.
 Revenue and Commercialization of our Products
 Commercialization of our Drug Discovery Assets
 We have recently begun partnering conversations regarding our drug discovery assets. These portfolio discussions are being addressed in two ways. First, we will seek to identify biopharmaceutical companies who want to partner with us to further develop individual drug candidates. These partnerships could be molecule, target or indication specific, or a combination of all three. We expect to have drug candidates for the first two indications available for potential partnership opportunities in 2023.

Second, we expect to begin partnering conversations with biopharmaceutical companies around the potential licensing of our drug discovery technology. These partnerships could use all of the platform technologies or only certain elements. We expect the supporting data associated with our discovery efforts to serve as tangible and objective proof of our ability to develop differentiated molecules, which would further enable partnership discussions.
 Revenue and Commercialization of our Profiling Products
 We currently market proprietary molecular profiling panels targeting early and late-stage drug development programs with potential breakthrough therapies. We market these panels to biopharmaceutical companies, with which we may collaborate in biomarker development programs. We believe these programs could facilitate our commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. In addition, our panels are used in pre-clinical and clinical research areas, which we believe will facilitate our commercialization of diagnostic tests, including tumor classifiers and prognostic tests.
Our product and product-related services revenue is generated primarily through the sale of our profiling instruments and consumables and sample processing services to biopharmaceutical companies, academic research centers and molecular testing laboratories.
 Customers can purchase our HTG EdgeSeq instrument and related consumables, which consist primarily of our proprietary molecular profiling panels and other assay components. We currently market a number of proprietary profiling panels including, but not limited to, the following panels which profile the full human mRNA and miRNA transcripts, respectively:
•HTG Transcriptome Panel. HTP is expertly designed to provide extensive coverage of most human mRNA transcripts. The panel can simultaneously interrogate 19,398 gene targets using FFPE, PAXgene and extracted RNA samples, generating data for up to 96 samples in less than three days. HTP uses our proprietary workflow and leverages the sensitivity and dynamic range of NGS, allowing researchers to generate reliable results using limited sample amount.
 •HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay. Human microRNAs (“miRNA”) are short non-coding strands of RNA that are used by the cell for gene expression regulation. The HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay enables the simultaneous profiling of 2,083 miRNAs, allowing new, potentially clinically relevant miRNA profiles to be discovered. Our ability to efficiently profile small FFPE samples or as little as 15 µL of plasma or serum is a significant differentiator in the rapidly growing miRNA market.
 Customers can also access our technology through contracted services. Pre-clinical services, including custom assay design and sample processing services provided by our VERI/O laboratory, allow our customers to identify and validate biomarker signatures across their drug portfolios or patient cohorts more efficiently. Our VERI/O laboratory is a high-volume molecular laboratory focused solely on providing high-quality data from our proprietary molecular profiling technology. These services provide our customers expedited access to our technology at a competitive price. For our biopharmaceutical company customers, we offer an end-to-end solution leveraging a single technology from discovery to diagnostics.
Through collaboration with biopharmaceutical company customers, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive services to design, develop and manufacture custom targeted assays with complex molecular diagnostic signatures as investigational use only (“IUO”) assays for use in global prospective or retrospective clinical trials. Our expertise in medical device design control and global regulatory submissions, coupled with our ISO 13485:2016 certified quality system, enable us to support potential CDx programs. Although our initial focus primarily has been in oncology, we offer customers a full solution from biomarker discovery to deployment of CDx assays across numerous disease states. Utilizing NGS as our method of detection provides our customers with the benefits of our highly multiplexed and extraction-free chemistry and the sensitivity and dynamic range of the sequencers, providing a powerful value proposition and complete workflow.
 Research and Development
 We are committed to the continued evolution of our HTG technology platforms, including our transcriptomic profiling, machine learning chemistry and our AI drug discovery technology. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, drug design and development, engineering and software development experience that we believe is necessary to successfully grow our business and allow us to reach our strategic objectives.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the largest portion of our research and development efforts were focused on achievement of our drug discovery milestones. We expect to continue to invest in this area as we expand our pipeline and take candidates into development. Upon commercial release of our HTP in August 2021, primary focus of development efforts related to our profiling business has shifted from development of new products to expansion of sample types and improvement of processes associated with our existing product portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, our research and development team consisted of 15 employees across the disciplines of research and development, platform development and chemistry, therapeutics and bioinformatics, of which 10 held PhDs.
Sales and Marketing
 We distribute our instruments and consumables via direct sales in the United States and Europe and through distributors in parts of Europe and other countries.
As of December 31, 2022, our U.S. sales and marketing organization consisted of seven employees including three in direct sales or sales management, two in sales support and two in marketing. In addition to our U.S. sales team, as of December 31, 2022, we had six direct sales and support employees in Europe and distribution agreements in several additional countries. This sales model provides us with direct sales coverage in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, with distributors in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kosovo, Leetonia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.
 Our sales and marketing efforts target biopharmaceutical companies, clinical research centers and clinical diagnostic labs focused on sample profiling for translational research, biomarker/companion assay development and lab-developed diagnostic testing. We intend to promote adoption of our HTG EdgeSeq platform, sample profiling panels and future molecular diagnostic assays upon marketing clearance or approval by the FDA, by expanding our U.S. sales force, building a greater direct sales presence in Europe, expanding international distribution and continuing to collaborate with key opinion leaders to validate our platform and to influence utilization of our products.
 We expect that our drug discovery assets will be monetized through internal and third-party corporate development resources, and expect initial partnering conversations to be primarily in the United States. We will conduct business development activities internally and with third parties with the objective of partnering our assets as they progress through the preclinical and clinical development pathway.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We primarily manufacture our products within our facility in Tucson, AZ. External resources are leveraged for their specific expertise in either producing components for our HTG EdgeSeq instrument and raw materials for our consumables in accordance with our designs or based on their catalog products which are utilized as is within our designs. We manufacture HTG EdgeSeq instruments and reagent kits at our Tucson, Arizona facility, which has been certified to ISO 13485:2016 standards. We believe that our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next several years.
 We require a wide variety of raw materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies to manufacture our products. While multiple commercial sources provide the majority of these required components and supplies, we currently rely on a single supplier to manufacture a subcomponent used in our HTG EdgeSeq instrument. As part of our standard supply management process, we continuously monitor material availability, vendor status and supply chain disruptions to identify and mitigate potential risks by expanding material and source alternatives. Although there are a limited number of manufacturers for components of this type, we believe that other suppliers could provide similar products on comparable terms if additional or alternative supply sources should be necessary in the future. In addition, while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we closely monitor inventory of this subcomponent and purchase incremental inventory in this area as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.
Instruments
 We assemble and test our HTG EdgeSeq instruments at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Instrument component vendors are qualified under our quality system and reviewed regularly to ensure that manufacturing standards are met and maintained. We award contracts for estimated annual quantities of components and, considering the replenishment lead times of our vendors, take delivery of batches covering approximately one month of demand at a time.
Consumables
 We manufacture and test our HTG EdgeSeq consumables at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Raw material vendors are selected using precise standards and are reviewed regularly for compliance with our specific quality requirements. We purchase raw material stock in quantities that often exceed projected annual demand in order to take advantage of bulk pricing discounts and manufacturing efficiencies. We produce batches of finished goods approximating quarterly demand and supervise inventory on a minimum/maximum basis to ensure that we are replenishing our finished goods and raw material ahead of demand.
Competition
 We have categorized known competition into:
 •In drug discovery, companies such as Accent Therapeutics, Arrakis Therapeutics, Storm Therapeutics and other discovery-stage biotechnology companies are focused on similar therapeutic areas;
 •In profiling, other molecular platform offerings, such as PCR-based technologies, microarrays and next-generation sequencers from companies such as Abbott Molecular, Affymetrix, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., BioRad Laboratories, Invitae, Fluidigm Corporation, Illumina, Inc., Luminex Corporation, NanoString Technologies, Inc., Personal Genome Diagnostics (acquired by Labcorp), entities owned and controlled by QIAGEN N.V., Roche Diagnostics, a division of the Roche Group of companies, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.;
 •Centralized CLIA certified labs offering molecular profiling and gene expression tests as laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) such as Caris, Inc., Exact Sciences, Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Foundation Medicine, Inc., NeoGenomics, Inc., Personalis, Inc. and Trovagene, Inc.; and
 •Decentralized CLIA certified labs developing LDTs locally such as major cancer centers.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in all our target markets include:
 •accuracy and reproducibility of results;
 •flexibility and ease-of-use;
 •compatibility with existing laboratory processes, tools and methods;
 •reputation among customers;
 •cost of capital equipment;
 •cost of consumables and supplies; and
 •innovation in product offerings.
 We believe the automation afforded by our HTG EdgeSeq platform coupled with fast turnaround time, high multiplexing capability, lysis only/no extraction protocol and low sample requirement gives us numerous competitive advantages in our target markets, as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report.
 While we believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above, many of our competitors are more highly capitalized and/or have been in existence for a longer period, and enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:
 •greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources;
 •broader product lines;
 •larger sales forces and more established distributor networks;
 •substantial intellectual property portfolios;
 •larger and more established customer bases and relationships; and
 •better established, larger scale and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.


 The biopharmaceutical sector is populated with companies advancing new or differentiated approaches to discovery and experimental therapeutics by way of different platform technologies or modalities with intent for application to specific disease areas through focus on pharmacologic targets or through phenotypic approaches. Each approach has inherent scientific risks that are intrinsic to the discovery sciences for molecule selection, as these efforts provide the early pipeline assets that progress into the more established and regulated stages of drug development. We believe that our approach, which is grounded in our exceptional RNA profiling capabilities now being applied to experimental systems used in conjunction with an advanced medicinal chemistry technology, can result in more well-informed design and selection of small molecule drug candidates very early on in the drug discovery process, thereby allowing for greater chances for success of these molecules. As such, we believe our approach differentiates us from the competition as the early risk reduction of small molecule design and selection is at the core of our strategy, with the flexibility for application across multiple therapy areas.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and maintain intellectual property rights relating to key aspects of the technology employed in our HTG EdgeSeq platform and assays, maintain any strategic licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely upon certain patents, registered and common law trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, invention and patent assignment agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Patents and Patent Applications
 As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio included seven issued U.S. patents, 58 granted foreign patents (variously in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom), and 22 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. This portfolio is directed to, inter alia, our nuclease-protection-based technologies, other nucleic-acid detection methods, methods for subtyping diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ("DLBCL"), distinguishing indeterminate nevi from melanoma and methods of therapeutics treatments using novel pharmaceutical compounds. Our patent portfolio will help us maintain an exclusive position in key areas of our business, including in the areas of targeted nuclease-protection based sequencing, and drug discovery applications of our technology. In addition, this portfolio may provide out‑licensing opportunities. There were at least 10 granted patents, including one U.S. patent, directed to our novel HTG EdgeSeq product in the portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Our HTG EdgeSeq patents will begin to expire in 2032. Our patent portfolio includes at least four applications and five patents directed towards our direct-target sequencing HTG EdgeSeq methods, at least three applications and eight patents directed towards our methods of subtyping DLBCL, and at least six applications directed towards our methods of detecting DNA and RNA in the same sample.
Trade Secrets
 We also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that we have entered into such agreements with all relevant parties, or that these parties will abide by the terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy or commercially exploit aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 For additional information relating to the risks associated with our intellectual property position see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
 Agreements with Third Parties
 Asset Purchase Agreement with NuvoGen Research, LLC
 We entered into an asset purchase agreement dated January 9, 2001, as amended in November 2003, September 2004, November 2012 and February 2014, with NuvoGen Research, LLC (“NuvoGen”) to acquire certain intellectual property from NuvoGen (“NuvoGen obligation”). The acquired technology generally relates to our former array-based nuclease protection panels. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the acquired technology, we agreed to pay NuvoGen aggregate cash compensation of $15.0 million. On an annual basis, we are currently obligated to pay the greater of $0.4 million or 6% of our annual revenue, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement totals $15.0 million. Interest on the remaining unpaid obligation has been accrued since January 1, 2019 and compounds annually at a rate of 2.5% per year. Accrued interest on this unpaid obligation is payable on the date that the remaining obligation is paid in full.
SVB Term Loan
 In June 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") for an asset-secured loan in the principal amount of $10.0 million with Silicon Valley Bank (currently named Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. following the closure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023 by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver) ("SVB"), as lender (the "SVB Term Loan"). The proceeds from the SVB Term Loan were fully funded on the June 25, 2020. Our obligations under the SVB Term Loan are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge).
 The SVB Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 2.5% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and 5.75%. Interest on the SVB Term Loan is due and payable monthly in arrears. The SVB Term Loan originally required interest-only payments through June 30, 2021. As a result of achieving an equity milestone defined in the Loan Agreement during the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the interest only period was extended for six months through December 31, 2021. Following the extended interest-only period, the Loan Agreement required equal monthly payments of principal and interest through the maturity date of December 1, 2023.
 Prepayments of the remaining SVB Term Loan, in whole or in part, will be subject to early termination fees of 1% and we will be required to pay a final fee premium equal to 8% of the principal amount of the SVB Term Loan upon termination of the Loan Agreement.
 The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, if any, to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
In July 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the SVB Term Loan (the "Term Loan Amendment"). Under the Term Loan Amendment, SVB agreed to remove a financial covenant under the Loan Agreement that had required the Company to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. In exchange for this accommodation, the Company prepaid $2.5 million of outstanding principal under the SVB Term Loan (the "Prepayment"). SVB waived the prepayment fee that otherwise would have applied to the Prepayment. The remaining outstanding principal amount due under the Term Loan will continue to be paid in equal monthly payments of principal and interest through the maturity date of December 31, 2023.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 Clinical laboratories acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase, capital lease or reagent purchasing agreement. These laboratories offer their customers a menu of testing services using laboratory-developed tests ("LDTs"), which they may develop using consumables they purchase from us. Our customers generate revenue for these testing services by collecting payments from third-party payors, including public and private payors, as well as patient co-payments. In the United States, claims for Medicare coverage are processed by private Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) such as Novitas and Cahaba on behalf of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and coverage for specific test codes are specified in Local Coverage Determinations (“LCDs”) issued by individual MACs or National Coverage Determinations (“NCDs”) which apply to all MACs. Private payors issue their own coverage determinations that are largely reflective of the CMS LCDs and NCDs. HTG closely monitors trends in coverage through interactions with customers, industry associations such as the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (“AMP”) and industry consultants; these trends are key considerations in our product development plans. In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, the Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets. Failure by our U.S. and ex-U.S. customers who use our tests to obtain coverage and sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.


Government Regulation – Medical Device Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Currently we are limited to marketing our products in the United States for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. However, we intend to seek regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain assays for diagnostic purposes. The companion diagnostic tests under development by HTG are classified as “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of such products for their intended use.
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA submission can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. We believe that our companion diagnostic tests under development would be eligible for the less burdensome 510(k) regulatory pathway.
 Device Classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” to either:
 •a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or
 •another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
 To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.


After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 The PMA Process
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 A PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical study data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in the device studies.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
 •the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
 •the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
 •labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
 •advertising and promotion requirements;
 •restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
 •the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;
 •the Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
 •medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 •an order of repair, replacement or refund;
 •device tracking requirements; and
 •post-approval study and post market surveillance requirements.
 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.


Research Use Only
 An RUO product is one that is not intended for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled “For Research Use Only”. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and most QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. In November 2013 the FDA issued a guidance document entitled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” (the “RUO Guidance”) which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling, advertising or promotion that suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequently offer it for clinical diagnostic use as a laboratory developed test is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s position that any assistance offered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinical laboratories, conflicts with RUO status.
European Union
 The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted requirements that affect our products. These requirements include establishing standards that address creating a certified quality system as well as several directives that address specific product areas. The most significant of these currently effective directives is the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (“IVDD”) which includes:
 •Essential Requirements. The IVDD specifies “essential requirements” that all medical devices must meet. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling.
 •Conformity Assessment. Unlike United States regulations, which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the IVDD for that device. A small number of products must go through a more formal premarket review process. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and European Economic Area.
 •Vigilance. The IVDD also specifies requirements for post market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA.
 On May 26, 2017, the EU released a new regulatory framework, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”) which is expected to replace IVDD. Our CE/IVD marked products continued to meet the requirements of IVDD for commercialization in the EU until the requirements of IVDR took effect on May 26, 2022. At this time we do not anticipate moving to the requirements of IVDR for our existing CE/IVD marked products. As such, these products are no longer available other than for research use only.
 Other International
 Several other countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries. Many of these standards are loosely patterned after those adopted by the EU, but with elements unique to each country. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction. We routinely monitor these developments and address compliance with the various country requirements as new standards are adopted.
Government Regulation – Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
 We may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. These laws include the following:

•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
 •federal physician self-referral statute, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to the entity for designated health services, which include clinical laboratory services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare, Medicaid or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the EU and the United Kingdom have established their own data security and privacy legal framework, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR"), which contain provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU or non-UK based companies under the regulation. Over time we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU or UK. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the EU GDPR, in the EU countries in which we operate, and the UK GDPR. In addition, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides certain privacy rights for California residents and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of such individuals or households. The CCPA applies to the personal data of California consumers, business representatives and employees, requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal data, and allows for a cause of action for certain data breaches. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA") amends the CCPA and expands its requirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal data and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. 


Healthcare Reform
 There have been and we anticipate that there will be healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future that may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the reimbursement for healthcare products and services. For example, the ACA, which substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, remains subject to challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which, among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. The IRA also includes measures designed to lower the cost of certain pharmaceutical products under the Medicare program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. Congress and the Biden administration are considering various health reform measures. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Human Capital
 Our ability to identify and recruit strong candidates into our company and to retain and develop current talent within our organization is a critical factor in our continued growth and performance improvement. We continue to initiate programs to promote our organizational culture and to identify the best possible new talent as the organization grows and new positions are made available. We believe our culture and commitment to our employees result in the attraction and retention of qualified talent, while providing significant value to our company and its stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, we had 53 full-time and one part-time employee, of which 11 are employed in administration, 13 in manufacturing and operations, 15 in research and development, two in regulatory and quality affairs, and 13 in direct sales and marketing.
