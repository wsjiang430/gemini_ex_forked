Our Coronavirus Vaccine Programs
 
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a serious public health issue of international concern. As of February 2023, the World Health Organization reports more than 757 million cases and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Coronavidae within the genus beta-coronavirus. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes one large Spike (“S”) protein that plays a pivotal role during viral attachment to the host receptor and entry into host cells. The S protein is the major principal target for vaccines against human coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (“RBD”) subunit of the S protein block the virus from binding to host cells. Over 90% of all neutralizing antibodies produced in response to infection are directed to the RBD subunit.
 
Based on our research, there are currently forty vaccines authorized for use in one or more countries around the world, including four in the United States. These vaccines are primarily designed to induce antibodies specific for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 but rely on different mechanisms for presentation or expression of the S antigen, including recombinant proteins, whole inactivated virus, defective adenovirus vectors (three different types) or mRNA. Unfortunately, the continued adaptation and mutation of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the emergence of variants that are not optimally neutralized by vaccine-induced antibodies. This has required the adjustment of vaccine composition and the administration of booster doses. Recently, the FDA indicated the likely need for continued vaccine adjustments and yearly boosters, similar to the approach used for influenza virus vaccines.
 
Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is the vaccine vector platform utilized in a number of our vaccine candidates. There are several advantages to vaccines based on the MVA vectors. Firstly, MVA has a large genetic coding capacity which provides the foundation for vaccines based on multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, instead of the singular focus on the S protein. This approach induces immune responses with greater breadth of specificity. Secondly, MVA is known to effectively induce T-cell responses in addition to antibodies and the responses are durable. Third, MVA replicates minimally in mammalian cells which contributes to it being an extremely safe vaccine platform for human vaccines. As a result of the combination of these properties, MVA is an ideal vaccine vector platform for the design of the next generation Covid-19 vaccines, especially in targeting patient populations with compromised immune systems.
 
GEO-CM04S1 for Immunocompromised Patients – The CDC and other global public health agencies identify immunocompromised patients, including patients who have received therapeutic procedures for hematologic malignancy, as highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be very serious in this vulnerable population of hematology patients, including autologous (auto) and allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), and recipients of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies. Given the serious impact of other respiratory viruses in this vulnerable patient population, it is anticipated that hematology recipients of cell therapy may develop severe clinical disease, profoundly impacting the therapy outcomes, such as morbidity and survival. Increasingly, there is evidence of the high risk of severe morbidity, hospitalization and death resulting from SARS-CoV-2 in hematology patients. To date, there has been no clinical trial of an approved vaccine focused on immunocompromised patients. Thus, the efficacy and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine remains to be established in the different immunocompromised patient populations and it is likely that candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may differ in their efficacy and safety for these patients.
 
Our vaccine candidate, GEO-CM04S1, is based on a synthetic, attenuated Modified Vaccinia Ankara (sMVA) vector expressing both spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and was initially developed at City of Hope (COH) for immunocompromised patients. In a placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial of healthy adults conducted by COH, GEO-CM04S1 was shown to be safe and immunogenic. In November 2021, GeoVax entered into a license agreement with COH, granting GeoVax exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize the vaccine.
 
GEO-CM04S1 is being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04977024) to evaluate its safety and immunogenicity, compared to either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA-based vaccine, in patients who have previously received either an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. GEO-CM04S1 is the only SARS-CoV-2vaccine that includes both S and N proteins to advance to a Phase 2 trial in cancer patients. MVA-vector based vaccines tend to produce an immune response quickly – in less than 14 days – with only mild side effects. The trial is also the first to compare an investigational multi-antigenic SARS-CoV-2vaccine to the current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna in people who are immunocompromised. Such patients have often shown a weak antibody response after receiving currently available COVID-19 vaccines.

GEO-CM04S1 as a Booster Vaccine – GEO-CM04S1 is also being studied in the Phase 2 portion of a Phase 1/2 trial (NCT04639466), evaluating its use as a universal booster vaccine to current FDA-approved two-shot mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The clinical trial, titled “Phase 1/2 Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and Biologically Effective Dose of COH04S1, a Synthetic MVA-based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine, Administered as One or Two Injections or as a Booster to Healthy Adult Volunteers” is being conducted at COH.
 
Because GEO-CM04S1 is designed to stimulate potent humoral and cellular immune responses against both the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2, GeoVax believes its administration as a booster will provide additional antigenic targets to the immune system resulting in a broader immune response. The GEO-CM04S1 vaccine’s MVA backbone may also be more effective at inducing immunity since MVA is known to strongly induce T cell responses even in a background of immunosuppression. In addition, GEO-CM04S1 may offer greater protection against the significant sequence variation observed with the S antigen and durability of immunity, which is well established for MVA.
 
The Phase 1 portion of the trial was designed as a dose-escalation safety study in healthy individuals between the ages of 18 to 55, who had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the GEO-CM04S1 in healthy volunteers who were administered the vaccine at three different dose levels by intramuscular (IM) injection. Follow-up studies of the volunteers are continuing in order to better assess duration of immune responses.
 
The Phase 2 booster study, for which vaccination is ongoing, will include 60 healthy individuals, 18 years of age and older, who were previously vaccinated with the two-dose regimen of one of the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, manufactured by either Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna. The study is designed as a dose-escalation trial to specifically evaluate the safety profile and immunogenicity of COH04S1 as a booster. The immunological responses measured throughout the study will include the level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), including the Omicron and Delta VOCs, as well as specific T-cell responses.
 
GEO-CM02 as a Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine – As noted, most of the first-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were designed to encode the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the goal of inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies. However, the limitations of this approach in the face of continually emerging variants is now obvious and alternative vaccine designs are being developed.
 
GeoVax has developed a design strategy for vaccines to induce broader immunity through inclusion of multiple, genetically conserved structural and nonstructural proteins from the target pathogen. This is possible through the use of its novel Modified Virus Ankara - Virus Like Particle (GV-MVA-VLPTM) platform. The goal is to induce a balanced immune response comprised of both antibody and cellular (T-cells) effectors against multiple immunogens, potentially limiting immune escape by emerging variants. Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins by MVA supports the in vivo formation of virus like particles (VLPs), which induce both antibody and T-cell responses. Incorporation of other sequence-conserved structural and nonstructural proteins will provide targets for T-cell responses to increase the breadth and function of vaccine-induced immune responses. This strategy provides the basis for generating a universal vaccine with augmented potential to alleviate the burden of disease caused by circulating coronaviruses. Unique compared to other vaccines approved or under development, the GeoVax vaccine candidates are therefore specifically designed to provide a broader and more long-lived level of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 which should protect against emerging variants while avoiding the potential side effects that can limit vaccine utility and acceptance.
 
GeoVax’s lead vaccine candidate (GEO-CM02) encodes the S protein as the antibody target and the M and E proteins as T-cell targets. In small animal studies, the Company measured functional immune responses after a single dose that mediated protection from infection and pathogenesis, including protection against the more virulent Beta variant.
 
In January 2021, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), awarded the GeoVax a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant in support of the Company’s vaccine development efforts. The Phase 1 grant, titled, “Preclinical Development of GV-MVA-VLP Vaccines Against COVID-19,” supported the ongoing design, construction and preclinical testing of our vaccine candidate’s evaluation. Scientific presentations and publications of the experimental results were delivered at multiple international vaccine conferences during 2021 and 2022 and publication is planned for early 2023. This product currently is serving as the foundation for further internal experimental design and small animal model testing focusing on the use of highly conserved viral nonstructural proteins as additional T-cell immunogens to further increase the functional and specificity of induced immune responses.

Our Cancer Therapy Programs
 
Gedeptin® – Gedeptin is a novel patented product/technology for the treatment of solid tumors through a gene therapy strategy known as Gene-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (GDEPT). In September 2021, GeoVax entered into an assignment and license agreement with PNP Therapeutics, Inc. (“PNP”), granting GeoVax exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Gedeptin. The Gedeptin technology was developed with funding support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the NIH. GeoVax’s license to Gedeptin includes the rights to expand the use of Gedeptin to all human diseases and/or conditions including, but not limited to, other solid tumors.
 
In GDEPT, a vector is used to selectively transduce tumor cells with a nonhuman gene, which expresses an enzyme that can convert a nontoxic prodrug into a very toxic antitumor compound, in situ. A cycle of Gedeptin therapy consists of three intra-tumoral injections of Gedeptin over a two-day period followed by infusion of a prodrug, fludarabine phosphate, once a day for three days. A Phase 1 dose ranging study, evaluating the safety of a single cycle of Gedeptin therapy, found the therapy to be well tolerated, with evidence of a reduction in tumor size in patients with solid tumors.
 
A Phase 1/2 trial (NCT03754933), evaluating the safety and efficacy of repeat cycles of Gedeptin therapy in patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with tumor(s) accessible for injection and no curable treatment options was initiated at the Stanford University Cancer Institute. The trial design involves repeat administration using Gedeptin followed by systemic fludarabine, as a way to gain additional information prior to expansion towards a larger patient trial. The initial stage of the study is being funded by the FDA pursuant to its Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program. The FDA has also granted Gedeptin orphan drug status for the intra-tumoral treatment of anatomically accessible oral and pharyngeal cancers, including cancers of the lip, tongue, gum, floor of mouth, salivary gland and other oral cavities. In January 2022, we engaged CATO SMS, a global provider of clinical research solutions, to manage the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, and to assist with the expansion of clinical sites and acceleration of patient enrollment and evaluation. In February 2023, GeoVax announced the expansion of the Gedeptin Phase 1/2 trial with patients actively enrolling at three prestigious National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated Cancer Centers -- Stanford University Cancer Institute, Emory University Winship Cancer Institute, and the Thomas Jefferson University Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. This trial will guide the design of a larger study that also may involve patients with other anatomically accessible oral and pharyngeal cancers and, may lead to labeling discussions with the FDA and initiation of further Gedeptin investigations including in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for additional cancerous and non-cancerous tumor indications.
 
MUC1-based Immunotherapy – Tumors are often able to inhibit the body’s natural immune system by producing inhibitory factors as a mechanism of immune resistance, especially against the T cells that are specific for tumor antigens and can kill cancer cells. The field of immuno-oncology has received new momentum with the discovery and commercial launch of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a type of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). ICIs block the naturally occurring and tumor-induced immune checkpoints, thus allowing functional T cells to more fully restore cellular proliferation, cytokine production and killing of tumor cells.
 
Unlike conventional therapies (e.g. radiation, chemotherapy, antibody, etc.), therapeutic cancer vaccines have the potential to induce responses that not only result in the control and even clearance of tumors but also establish immunological memory that can suppress and prevent tumor recurrence. Convenience, safety, and low toxicity of cancer vaccines could make them invaluable tools to be included in future immunotherapy approaches in combination with ICIs for treating tumors. Currently, there are only a few vectored cancer vaccines being tested in combination with ICIs, all of which are in early clinical stages.
 
We are developing our GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform that is based on the aberrantly glycosylated forms of the cell surface-associated MUC1 protein that is expressed on a wide range of cancers, including breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and lung, with the goal of raising therapeutic anti-tumor antibodies and T cell responses in cancer patients.
 
● | We have produced a MVA-VLP-MUC1 vaccine candidate, demonstrated VLP production by electron microscopy using MUC1 immunogold staining, and showed that the VLPs express a hypo-glycosylated form of MUC1 in human cell lines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We collaborated with Dr. Olivera Finn, a leading expert in cancer immunotherapy at the University of Pittsburgh, who was one of the first medical researchers to show that many tumors express an abnormal form of MUC1 that is recognized by the immune system as foreign. Our collaboration with Dr. Finn has shown that a combination of our MVA-VLP-MUC1 vaccine candidate with a MUC1 synthetic peptide was capable of breaking tolerance to human MUC1 in transgenic mice and inducing immune responses with efficacy against challenge in a lymphoma tumor model.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2022, we initiated potentially IND enabling small animal studies with Dr. Pinku Mukherjee at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to define the optimal course and schedule of vaccination to define a protocol that can be evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. These studies, which are ongoing, include assessment of the therapeutic benefit the vaccine in combination with a synthetic peptide, adjuvant and immune checkpoint inhibitor using a human MUC1 transgenic mouse model to optimally match existing and previously tested cancer treatment regimens.

MVA as Smallpox (SPox) and Monkeypox (MPox) Vaccine
 
MVA was originally developed for use as a smallpox (SPox) vaccine more than 30 years ago. Its preferred use is for individuals with compromised immune systems; individuals that would be put at risk if administered the normal SPox vaccine. It is also approved as the vaccine for other orthopox vaccines, including monkeypox (MPox). As such, an added potential benefit of our vaccines is that in those regions where MPox or SPox are of concern, vaccines built on an MVA vaccine platform will likely provide protection against MPox and SPox.
 
MVA is the vaccine currently used and stockpiled in the US Strategic National Stockpile for immunization against the monkeypox (MPox) and smallpox (SPox) viruses. GeoVax previously demonstrated that an experimental HIV vaccine, utilizing NIH-MVA as the vaccine vector, protected non-human primates challenged with a lethal dose of the MPox virus. Further, in August 2022, the City of Hope team, which originally developed GEO-CM04S1, published results demonstrating that both their proprietary sMVA (synthetic MVA) and GEO-CM04S1 (referred to as “COH04S1” in the publication) elicited robust orthopoxvirus-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses. The authors conclude that GEO-CM04S1 and sMVA represent unique vaccine candidates to control the unforeseen global MPox outbreak.
 
In response to the global need to address the continued emerging threat from MPox and the unique opportunity offered by MVA-based vaccines, GeoVax recently secured rights from the NIH covering preclinical, clinical and commercial uses of the NIH-MVA against MPox or SPox viruses. The Company is now evaluating development and regulatory pathways towards expanding the public health options available to reduce and manage the risk of MPox worldwide.
 
Our Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Vaccines (Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan, Marburg and Lassa) 
 
Ebola (EBOV, formerly designated as Zaire ebolavirus), Sudan (SUDV), and Marburg viruses (MARV) are the most virulent species of the Filoviridae family, causing hemorrhagic fever illnesses with up to a 90% fatality rate in humans. Lassa fever virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family, also causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic illnesses in an overlapping region with Ebola. In December 2019, FDA approved the first live recombinant Ebola vaccine for prevention of Ebola disease by Zaire virus. This rVSV-ZEBOV showed safety concerns in Phase 1 trials and by virtue of being replication competent could pose threats to immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with HIV living in West Africa where recent Ebola epidemics started.
 
To address the unmet need for a product that can respond to future hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, we are developing vaccines utilizing our GV-MVA-VLP™ platform. As previously noted, the MVA vector itself is considered safe, having originally been developed for use in immunocompromised individuals as a smallpox vaccine. We expect our vaccines may not only protect at-risk individuals against EBOV, SUDV, MARV and LASV, but also potentially reduce or modify the severity of other re-emerging pathogens such as Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, and Reston viruses, based on antigenic cross reactivity and the elicitation of T cells to the more conserved matrix proteins (e.g. VP40 or Z) in addition to standard GP proteins used by us and other manufacturers. Thus, the GeoVax GV-MVA-VLP™ approach could offer a unique combination of advantages to achieve breadth and safety of a pan-filo vaccine. In addition to protecting historically higher-risk populations in Africa, it is also intended to prevent the spread of disease to the US and globally, and for preparedness against terrorist release of any of bio-threat pathogens in the US and globally.
 
Our initial preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates for our MVA-VLP-EBOV vaccine candidate have shown significant levels of protection against a lethal doses of EBOV. Recent studies in lethal challenge guinea pig models demonstrated that GeoVax vaccines MVA-VLP-SUDV and MVA-VLP-MARV conferred 100% protection from death. These vaccines were subsequently evaluated in a rigorous cynomolgus macaque infectious challenge model. Vaccination protected nonhuman primates from viremia, weight loss and death following challenge with a dose of Sudan or Marburg virus that is lethal in nonvaccinated animals. Evaluation of immune responses following vaccination demonstrated presence of both neutralizing antibodies and functional T cells, indicating a breadth of responses that combine for optimal protection. The nonhuman primate studies conducted in collaboration with NIAID and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) have been completed and clinical development programs are being defined with an initial focus on the MVA-VLP-MARV product.
 
Other Infectious Disease Programs
 
GEO-ZM02 for Zika – Zika disease is an emerging infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and has been linked to an increase in microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome (a neurodegenerative disease) in adults. ZIKV is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes medically important pathogens such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. Public health officials recommend avoiding exposure to ZIKV, delaying pregnancy, and following basic supportive care (fluids, rest, and acetaminophen) after infection.
 
   5

  

To address the unmet need for a ZIKV vaccine, we are developing novel vaccine candidates constructed using our GV-MVA-VLP platform. MVA has an outstanding safety record, which is particularly important given the need to include women of child-bearing age and newborns among those being vaccinated. Our Zika vaccine is designed based on the NS1 gene product to eliminate the risk of Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE), which is a serious side effect observed when a vaccinated individual doesn’t have a fully protective immune response which actually causes a more virulent reaction if infected.
 
Our initial preclinical studies in rodents using our GEO-ZM02 vaccine candidate demonstrated 100% single-dose protection against a lethal dose of ZIKV delivered directly into the brain. In rhesus macaques, vaccination with GEO-ZM02 induced immune responses that effectively controlled the virus replication despite the fact the vaccine is not designed to induce ZIKV neutralizing antibodies. Further development of GEO-ZM02 will be dependent upon partnering support.
 
In January 2023, GeoVax announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Notice of Allowance for Patent Application No. 17/000,768 titled, “Method for Generating a ZIKV Immune Response Utilizing a Recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vector Encoding the NS1 Protein.” Preclinical studies demonstrated a single dose of GEO-ZM02 provided 100% protection against a lethal dose of Zika virus.
 
GEO-MM02 for Malaria – According to recent data from the World Health Organization, globally, malaria causes 227 million infections and 619,000 deaths annually. Despite decades of vaccine research, vaccine candidates have failed to induce substantial protection. Most of these vaccines are based on individual proteins that induce immune responses targeting only one stage of the malaria parasite’s life cycle. GeoVax’s MVA-VLP malaria vaccine candidates incorporate antigens derived from multiple stages of the parasite’s life cycle and are designed to induce an immune response with durable functional antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, all hallmarks of an ideal vaccine-induced immune response.
 
We have collaborated with the Burnet Institute, a leading infectious diseases research institute in Australia, for the development of a vaccine to prevent malaria infection. The project included the design, construction, and characterization of multiple malaria vaccine candidates using GeoVax’s GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform combined with malaria Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax sequences identified by the Burnet Institute. The vaccine design, construction, and characterization were performed at GeoVax with immunogenicity and challenge studies in animal models conducted at Burnet Institute using their unique functional assays. Further development of GEO-MM02 will be dependent upon additional funding support via federal grants or other sources.
 
HIV – Due to our corporate refocusing of development efforts prioritizing our SARS-CoV-2 and cancer immunotherapy programs, and to a lack of continuing government support for our HIV vaccine development efforts, in early 2022 we decided to discontinue active development of these programs. Our technology and intellectual property will remain available for out-license or partnering, but we are no longer devoting any significant corporate resources to this program.
 
Of interest, recent results from a clinical study of a combinational HIV therapy that included GeoVax’s HIV booster vaccine candidate, MVA62B were presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) held February 19-22, 2023 in Seattle, Washington. The data presented were part of an effort led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), to develop a combinational therapy aimed at inducing remission in HIV-positive individuals (a “functional cure”). The primary objectives of the proof-of-concept trial were to assess the safety and tolerability of the combinational therapy and to determine the viral load “set-point” during antiviral treatment interruption. Secondary objectives were to assess immune responses and changes in viral reservoir status. The clinical trial was led by Steven Deeks, M.D. of UCSF, a world leader in therapeutic approaches to HIV infections, and was one of the most comprehensive tests to date for the ability of synergistic approaches to control HIV infection. The studies were conducted with funding from amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. The overall goal of this trial was to induce immune responses that could potentially control HIV replication in patients in the absence of antiviral drugs. The data presented by the UCSF researchers indicated very high levels of immunogenicity (particularly T cell immunity), despite the fact these occurred in technically immunocompromised patients. These results further validate the ability of the MVA-VLP platform to stimulate a robust T-cell response to various diseases.

Our GV-MVA-VLP™ Platform
 
GeoVax’s GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform utilizes Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), a large virus capable of carrying several vaccine antigens, that expresses proteins that assemble into virus-like particles (VLP) immunogens in the person receiving the vaccine. The production of VLPs in the person being vaccinated can mimic the virus production that occurs in a natural infection, stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system to recognize, prevent, and control the target infection. The MVA-VLP derived vaccines can elicit durable immune responses in the host similar to a live-attenuated virus, while providing the safety characteristics of a replication-defective vector.
 
Vaccines typically contain agents (antigens) that resemble disease-causing microorganisms. Traditional vaccines are often made from weakened or killed forms of the virus or from its surface proteins. Some newer vaccines use recombinant DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) technology to generate vaccine antigens in bacteria or cultured cells from specific portions of the DNA sequence of the target pathogen. The generated antigens are then purified and formulated for use in a vaccine. We believe the most successful of these purified antigens have been non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) as exemplified by vaccines for hepatitis B (Merck’s Recombivax® and GSK’s Engerix®) and Papilloma viruses (GSK’s Cervarix®, and Merck’s Gardasil®). Our approach uses recombinant DNA and/or recombinant MVA to produce VLPs in the person being vaccinated (in vivo) reducing complexity and costs of manufacturing. In human clinical trials of our HIV vaccines, we believe we have demonstrated that our VLPs, expressed from within the cells of the person being vaccinated, can be safe, yet elicit both strong and durable humoral and cellular immune response.
 
VLPs mimic authentic viruses in form but are not infectious or capable of replicating and can cause the body’s immune system to recognize and kill targeted viruses to prevent an infection. VLPs can also train the immune system to recognize and kill virus-infected cells to control infection and reduce the length and severity of disease. One of the biggest challenges with VLP-based vaccines is to design the vaccines in such a way that the VLPs will be recognized by the immune system in the same way as the authentic virus would be. We design our vaccines such that, when VLPs for enveloped viruses like HIV, Ebola, Marburg or Lassa fever are produced in vivo (in the cells of the recipient), they include not only the protein antigens, but also an envelope consisting of membranes from the vaccinated individual’s cells. In this way, they are highly similar to the virus generated in a person’s body during a natural infection. VLPs produced in vitro (in a pharmaceutical plant), by contrast, have no envelope; or, envelopes from the cultured cells (typically hamster or insect cells) used to produce them. We believe our technology therefore provides distinct advantages by producing VLPs that more closely resemble the authentic viruses. We believe this feature of our immunogens allows the body’s immune system to more readily recognize the virus. By producing VLPs in vivo, we believe we also avoid potential purification issues associated with in vitro production of VLPs.
 
Figure 1 below shows examples of thin section electron micrographs of actual viruses and VLPs for these viruses expressed by GeoVax MVA-VLP vaccines.


Figure 1. Comparison of MVA-VLPs and native virus structures
 
In the MVA-VLP platform, we take advantage of MVA’s large “coding capacity” to insert genes that encode multiple proteins, the combination of which is adequate to support the generation of VLPs by the MVA infected cells. Utility has been demonstrated for multiple vaccine candidates wherein the MVA-encoded viral matrix proteins and glycoproteins assemble into VLPs. MVA was originally developed as a safer smallpox vaccine for use in immune-compromised individuals. It was developed by attenuating the standard smallpox vaccine by passaging it (over 500 passages) in chicken embryos or chicken embryo fibroblasts, resulting in a virus with limited ability to replicate in human cells (thus safe) but with high replication capability in avian cells (thus cost effective for manufacturing). The modifications also resulted in the loss of immune evasion genes which assist the spread of wild type smallpox infections, even in the presence of human immune responses.

We collaborated with the laboratory of Dr. Bernard Moss at NIH/NIAID on four different generations of MVA vectors, spanning over 15 years of collaboration, to effectively express vaccine proteins that assemble into VLPs. These efforts led to the development of different shuttle vectors and the identification of multiple insertion sites for introducing foreign genes encoding the vaccine target proteins into MVA in a manner that optimizes each product for manufacturing stability. Each MVA-VLP vaccine has up to two expression cassettes, each encoding one or more antigens selected from pathogens of interest. At a minimum, each vaccine expresses two antigens required for VLP formation; in the case of HIV and hemorrhagic fever vaccines for example, a viral matrix protein and an envelope glycoprotein. We use a synthetic early late promoter that provides high, yet not lethal, levels of insert expression, which is initiated immediately after infection in cells of the vaccinated individual.
 
Our GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform affords other advantages:
 
● | Safety: Safety for MVA, generally, has been shown in more than 120,000 subjects in Europe, including immunocompromised individuals during the initial development of MVA and more recently with the development of MVA as a safer vaccine against smallpox. Our HIV vaccines demonstrated outstanding safety in multiple human clinical trials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Durability: Our technology raises highly durable (long-lasting) vaccine responses. We hypothesize that elicitation of durable vaccine responses is conferred on responding B cells by the vaccinia parent of MVA, which raises highly durable responses for smallpox. 
● | Limited pre-existing immunity to vector: Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox vaccinations subsequently ended, leaving all but those born before 1980 and selected populations (such as vaccinated laboratory workers and first responders) unvaccinated and without pre-existing immunity to MVA-derived vaccines. A potential interference of pre-existing immunity to a vector may be more problematic with those vectors related to parent viruses used in routine vaccinations (e.g. measles) or constitute common viruses that infect people of all ages (e.g. cytomegalovirus).
● | Repeated use of the platform for different vaccines used in sequence. In mouse experiments, we have shown that two of our vaccines (e.g. GV-MVA-VLP-Zika followed by GV-MVA-VLP-Ebola) can be given at <4 week intervals without any negative impact on their immunogenicity (lack of vector immunity). 
● | No need for adjuvants: MVA generally stimulates strong innate immune responses and does not require the use of adjuvants. 
● | Protection against MPOX and SPOX: MVA vectored vaccines have been previously shown to provide potential protection against MPOX/SPOX. 
● | Thermal stability: MVA is stable in both liquid and lyophilized formats (> 6 years of storage). 
● | Genetic stability and manufacturability: If appropriately engineered, MVA is genetically stable and can reliably be manufactured in either the established Chick Embryo Fibroblast cell substrate, or novel continuous cell lines that support scalability as well as greater process consistency and efficiency. 

Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the manufacture of our products. Complying with these regulations involves considerable expertise, time and expense.
 
In the United States, drugs and biologics are subject to rigorous federal and state regulation. Our products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the Public Health Service Act, and the regulations promulgated under these statutes, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of medications and medical devices. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, takes several years and involves great expense. The steps required before a human vaccine may be marketed in the United States include:
 

● | Preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Manufacturing and testing of the product under strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations; 
● | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence;
● | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | The submission of a Biologics License Application to the FDA, along with the required user fees; and 
● | FDA approval of the BLA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product

Before marketing any drug or biologic for human use in the United States, the product sponsor must obtain FDA approval. In addition, each manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA and must pass a pre-approval inspection before introducing any new drug or biologic into commercial distribution.
 
The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority granted to the FDA allows the FDA to help strengthen the nation’s public health protections against certain threats by facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures needed during public health emergencies. Under section 564 of the FD&C Act, the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. This potentially may provide a faster pathway to market for our COVID-19 or other infectious disease vaccine candidates. This was the approval pathway followed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna for their respective COVID-19 vaccines.
 
Because GeoVax does not manufacture vaccines for human use within our own facilities, we must ensure compliance both in our own operations and in the outsourced manufacturing operations. All FDA-regulated manufacturing establishments (both domestic establishments and foreign establishments that export products to the United States) are subject to inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s cGMP regulations for products, drugs and devices.
 
The FDA determines compliance with applicable statutes and regulations through documentation review, investigations, and inspections. Several enforcement mechanisms are available to the FDA, ranging from a simple demand to correct a minor deficiency to mandatory recalls, closure of facilities, and even criminal charges for the most serious violations.
 
Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 
Whether or not the FDA has approved the drug, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.
 
Recent Government Initiatives
 
US Regulators and Senior White House and Congressional Leaders have announced multiple objectives and initiatives in 2023 that may impact GeoVax. These include:
 
- | Supporting the development of innovative vaccine platforms facilitating the production of a next generation broader performing COVID vaccine – GeoVax’s MVA-VLP platform is a logical candidate given the features and benefits noted throughout this report.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | The reshoring and protection of the domestic biotech ecosystem – GeoVax represents the first domestic source for SPox and MPox production which is currently controlled by a single foreign entity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Replenishing the US stockpile with additional vaccines addressing MPOX and Hemorrhagic Fevers – GeoVax has multiple products in advanced stages of development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Assisting African countries in their quest to prevent an array of debilitating illnesses including those caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses Fevers – GeoVax has multiple products in advanced stages of development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDA Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 
Section 524 of the FD&C Act authorizes the FDA to award priority review vouchers (PRVs) to sponsors of approved tropical disease product applications that meet certain criteria. To qualify for a PRV, a sponsor’s application must be for a drug or biological product for the prevention or treatment of a “tropical disease,” must otherwise qualify for priority review, and must contain no active ingredient (including any salt or ester of an active ingredient) that has been approved in any other application under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Services Act. Priority review means that the FDA aims to render a decision in 6 months.

The PRV may be sold. For example, a small company might win a voucher for developing a drug for a neglected disease and sell the voucher to a large company for use on a commercial disease. The price of the voucher depends on supply and demand. The voucher’s value derives from three factors: shifting sales earlier, longer effective patent life due to earlier entry, and competitive benefits from earlier entry relative to competitors. Top-selling treatments can yield billions in sales each year, so being approved months earlier can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the voucher. Since the first voucher sale in 2014, the price of the vouchers has ranged from $68 million to $350 million.
 
GeoVax believes that its vaccine programs in Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, Lassa Fever, Malaria and Zika may each be eligible for a PRV and we intend to apply for a PRV at the appropriate time. There can be no assurance, however, that we will qualify or be approved for a PRV.
 
Manufacturing
 
To be successful, our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. To date, we have not commercialized any products, nor have we demonstrated that we can manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements. If we cannot manufacture products in suitable quantities and in accordance with regulatory standards, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, it may delay clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing efforts for such products. Such delays could adversely affect our competitive position and our chances of achieving profitability. We cannot be sure that we can manufacture, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, such products at a cost or in quantities that are commercially viable.
 
We do not currently have the facilities or internal expertise to manufacture any of the clinical or commercial supplies of any of our product. Rather, our strategy is to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce vaccines needed for research and clinical trials. We have arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of our DNA and MVA vaccines for use in our planned clinical trials. These suppliers operate under the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices and (in the case of European manufacturers) similar regulations of the European Medicines Agency. We anticipate that these suppliers will be able to provide sufficient vaccine supplies to complete our currently planned clinical trials. Various contractors are generally available in the United States and Europe for manufacture of vaccines for clinical trial evaluation, however, it may be difficult to replace existing contractors for certain manufacturing and testing activities and costs for contracted services may increase substantially if we switch to other contractors. Furthermore, there is currently a shortage of vaccine manufacturing capability due to demand for potential COVID-19 vaccines, which could affect our ability to have our vaccine candidates manufactured.
 
We recently announced significant progress in developing a high-yield, high-capacity, continuous avian cell line system for manufacturing its MVA-based vaccines and immunotherapies.
 
Currently, MVA vaccines are manufactured in cells cultured from chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF), a suboptimal and time-consuming process useful primarily for niche markets and stockpile reserves. Now, after exploring various approaches to growing MVA in continuous cell lines in bioreactors more suitable for high-yield, commercial-scale manufacturing, we will accelerate activities towards fully implementing a proprietary, continuous cell line manufacturing system that will provide lower-cost, scalable versatility for broad MVA vaccine and immunotherapy applications.
 
Developing a high-yield, high-capacity process to produce MVA-based vaccines and immunotherapies constitutes a transformational development – for GeoVax, biomedicine, and the public’s health. By advancing our MVA manufacturing to a modern, interchangeable process, we are on course to expand MVA applications from stockpile-based solutions for niche medical markets to respond to world needs on a timely basis, whenever and wherever they arise. We believe that this capability puts us in the position to be the first supplier of MVA-based vaccines to implement such a transformative manufacturing process and becoming the first U.S.-based supplier of the MVA vaccine to prevent Mpox (monkeypox), Smallpox and other pox-related viruses.
 
The raw materials and other supplies that are used in the production process for our vaccines and that we use in our research activities are generally available from a number of commercial suppliers and we believe we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of such materials and supplies for all foreseeable clinical investigations.

Competition
 
Our product candidates face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions. We compete in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological change; evolving industry standards; emerging competition; and new product introductions. Competitors have existing products and technologies that will compete with our pipeline candidates and technologies and may develop and commercialize additional products and technologies that will compete with our pipeline candidates and technologies. Because competing companies and institutions may have greater financial resources than us, they may be able to provide broader services and product lines; and make greater investments in research and development. Competitors may also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They may also have greater name recognition and better access to customers.
 
We face general market competition from several subsectors of the vaccine development field, including large, multinational pharmaceutical companies including Sanofi, GSK, Merck, Janssen, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Takeda, and Pfizer, Inc.; mid-size pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies including Dynavax, Novavax Inc., Moderna, BioNTech, Bavarian Nordic and Hookipa; and academic and not-for-profit vaccine researchers and developers including the NIH. The industry is typified by extensive collaboration, licensing, and merger and acquisition activity despite the intense competition.
 
More than forty COVID-19 vaccines are currently authorized for use in one or more countries around the world, including three in the United States (from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen). All these vaccines are based on the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but rely on different mechanisms for presentation or expression of the S antigen, including whole, inactivated virus, defective adenovirus vectors (three different types) or mRNA. The World Health Organization reports that there are 180 COVID products in clinical development.
 
A number of companies are developing various types of therapeutic vaccines or other immunotherapy approaches to treat cancer including Advaxis, Immune Design, Oncothyreon, Bavarian Nordic, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Merck & Co, Bristol Myers Squibb, and AstraZeneca plc.
 
There are currently no FDA licensed and commercialized Zika vaccines, or hemorrhagic fever virus vaccines (other than for Ebola) available in the world market. We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in vaccine research and development in these areas. For hemorrhagic fever viruses, these include NewLink Genetics and Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, Inovio and GlaxoSmithKline. For Zika, these include NewLink Genetics, Inovio, Merck, Butantan Institute and NIH (NIAID). In December 2019, the FDA approved the first vaccine (ERVEBO®) for prevention of Ebola, developed by Merck.
 
There are currently no commercialized vaccines to prevent malaria infection. A first-generation infection-blocking malaria vaccine, RTS, S, is under regulatory review. It requires 4 doses and has been recommended by the WHO for pilot implementation studies. Since this vaccine is based on a single antigen and has modest efficacy (30-40%, depending on the age of subjects), the WHO has defined a Road Map for developing and licensing of next generation malaria vaccines. These vaccines are expected to contain multiple antigens designed to block both infection and transmission of malaria with at least a 75% efficacy rate.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability, and our licensors’ ability, to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our clinical product candidates, including our Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Virus-Like Particle (MVA-VLP) based vaccines, our in-licensed synthetic MVA Covid-19 vaccine candidate, and our in-licensed Gedeptin gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, and methods of treatment using the same.
 
We, and in collaboration with our licensors for our in-licensed assets, seek patent protection on each of our product and developmental candidates and, where applicable, on combinations with other therapeutic and/or antigenic agents and dosing schedules. Our success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. patent applications and, where appropriate, foreign patent applications covering our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We collaborate with our licensors to ensure the filing of U.S. patent applications and, where appropriate, foreign patent applications covering our in-licensed technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, and other countries that provide a period of clinical data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our clinical product candidates.
 
   11

  

We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategies as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to improve our basic technology, adapt to competition, or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop. Our patent filing strategy typically includes seeking patent protection in the United States and, wherein appropriate, in additional countries where we believe such protection is likely to be useful.
 
As of December 31, 2022, our owned, co-owned, and in-licensed patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 20 granted or allowed U.S. patent applications, 13 pending U.S. patent applications; 53 granted foreign patents, 47 pending foreign patent applications, 1 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application, and 2 U.S. provisional applications spread over 23 patent families. The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application which serves as a priority application. In addition, we plan to seek patent term adjustments, restorations, and/or patent term extensions where applicable in the United States and other jurisdictions. For example, depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our vaccine products, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the “Hatch-Waxman Amendments,” and codified as 35 U.S.C. § 156. 35 U.S.C. § 156 permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a Biologics License Application (BLA), plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved vaccine product is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our, or our exclusively licensed, issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 
Our current patent portfolio includes 4 patent families directed to various aspects of our DNA and MVA-based HIV vaccines, their genetic inserts expressing multiple HIV protein components, composition, structure, claim of immunization against multiple subtypes of HIV, routes of administration, safety and other related factors and methods of therapeutic and prophylactic use thereof including administration regimes. We have in-licensed patents from Emory University and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) relevant to our HIV-vaccine program. These patents will expire between 2022 and 2028, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions. We wholly own one patent family, including one granted U.S. patent (US 11,098,086), directed to specific vaccine administration methods which, where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one allowed U.S. patent application directed to preventive vaccines against Ebola virus, and one pending U.S. patent application directed to Marburg virus and uses thereof. These applications, where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2036, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one allowed U.S. patent application directed to preventive vaccines against Zika virus and uses thereof. This application, where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one granted U.S. patent (U.S. 11,311,612) and one pending U.S. patent application directed to preventive vaccines against malaria and use thereof. These applications, where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2038, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own 3 patent families, which includes two granted U.S. patents (U.S. 11,278,607 and U.S. 11,413,341), and granted foreign applications in Australia, China, and Japandirected to our immuno-oncology vaccine compositions and methods of use thereof. An application has been allowed at the European Patent Office. Applications are pending in the United States, Canada, India, China, and Japan. The patent applications of these families, where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2037-2040, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
   12

  

We wholly own one pending patent family directed to various MVA-based vaccines for the treatment of SARS CoV-2. Applications have been filed in the United States, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, the European Patent Office, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and Taiwan. The patent applications in these families, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2021, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have non-exclusively in-licensed from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3 patent families directed to certain aspects of our MVA-viral backbone used in our SARS-CoV2 vaccine, which will expire between 2023 and 2032, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have non-exclusively in-licensed from the NIH 2 patent families relating to coronavirus spike protein compositions relevant to our MVA SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidates. The patent applications for these families, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2037 and 2041, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one allowed U.S. application directed to MVA-based vaccines for the treatment of Zika virus. The patent application, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We own one patent family directed to viral constructs for use in enhancing T-cell priming during vaccination. The patent applications in this patent family, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2043, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We co-own two patent families with Leidos, Inc. directed to viral constructs for use in enhancing T-cell priming during vaccination. The patent applications in these patent families, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2042 and 2043, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We are the exclusive, worldwide licensee of several patents and patent applications, which we refer to as the Emory Technology, owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Emory University for HIV or smallpox vaccines pursuant to a license agreement originally entered into on August 23, 2002 and restated on June 23, 2004 (the “Emory License”). The in-licensed Emory University patents will expire between 2022 and 2028, exclusive of any patent term extensions. Through the Emory License we are also a non-exclusive licensee of four issued United States patents owned by the NIH related to the ability of our MVA vector vaccine to operate as a vehicle to deliver HIV virus antigens, and to induce an immune response in humans. These in-licensed NIH patents will expire in 2023, exclusive of any patent term extensions.
 
The MVA backbone that we have been using in our vaccines was provided to us by the laboratory of Dr. Bernard Moss of the NIAID, Laboratory of Viral Diseases (LVD). We have a non-exclusive commercial license to the NIH MVA backbone for our SARS CoV-2 vaccine with the NIAID of the National Institutes of Health NIH on behalf of the United States, which includes the use of certain patents and patent applications arising from the Moss laboratory and the provided materials. We also have a non-exclusive research and development license to use the MVA backbone for our other vaccine candidates. If we later decide to commercialize vaccine candidates that are under the research and development license, we will need to negotiate appropriate commercialization licenses. These in-licensed NIH patents and patent applications, if and where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2023 and 2032, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We have exclusively in-licensed three patent families from the City of Hope in the field of vaccine products targeted for prevention, reduction, amelioration or treatment of COVID-19 pursuant to an Exclusive License Agreement entered into on November 9, 2021. The in-licensed patent families are directed to synthetic MVA vectors, including synthetic MVA vaccines encoding one or more SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and their methods of production and use, and encompass COH04S1, a multi-antigenic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine currently undergoing Phase 2 human clinical trials. These in-licensed City of Hope patent families, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2041 and 2042, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We have exclusively in-licensed two patent families from the University of Alabama and the Southern Research Institute pursuant to an Assignment and License Agreement with PNP Therapeutics, Inc. entered into on September 28, 2021. The two patent families are directed to the use of tail-mutant purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes and fludarabine for the treatment of cancer, and cover aspects of the use of our Gedeptin clinical product candidate. These in-licensed patent families, where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2029 and 2032, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
In November 2022, we executed a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the clinical and commercial use of an unmodified (parental) MVA 1974/NIH Clone I as a vaccine against monkeypox virus. The MTA is royalty-free, non-exclusive, and worldwide.

We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have or have licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the United States or any other country. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that those patents will be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our products or processes. Furthermore, our patents, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents and may acquire additional patents or proprietary rights relating to products or processes competitive to ours. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us, if available at all.
 
We also expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, and other countries that provide a period of regulatory exclusivity to compensate for the time and cost required in securing regulatory approval of our clinical products. For example, in 2010, the United States enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). Under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of biological products may be granted 12 years of exclusive use before biosimilar versions of such products can be licensed for marketing in the U.S. This means that the FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of our products until 12 years after the date the product is approved for sale (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results accepted by the FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date we receive approval from the FDA to sell our product. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which potentially relevant patents may be shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCIA also provides incentives to biosimilar applicants by providing a period of exclusivity to the first biosimilar of a product approved by the FDA. The 12-year data exclusivity provision of the BPCIA does not prevent a competitor from seeking marketing approval of one of our products, or a product similar thereto, by submitting its own, original Biologics License Application (BLA).
 
We intend to benefit, where applicable, from additional market exclusivity provisions in various jurisdictions that reward the treatments of rare diseases. For example, in the United States under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a vaccine product intended to prevent or treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication; in the latter case, because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity.
 
We are not a party to any litigation, opposition, interference, or other potentially adverse proceeding with regard to our patent positions. However, if we become involved in litigation, interference proceedings, oppositions or other intellectual property proceedings, for example as a result of an alleged infringement or a third-party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous if available at all.
 
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented, proprietary trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

License Agreements
 
City of Hope License – On November 9, 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (COH License) with City of Hope (COH), a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, under which the Company obtained exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize COH04S1, a multi-antigenic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine currently undergoing Phase 2 human clinical trials. The COH License grants GeoVax exclusive rights to key patents, know-how, regulatory filings and clinical materials for use against COVID-19. The terms of the COH License, include an upfront fee consisting of an initial payment to COH of $5,000,000 within 30 days of the effective date of the COH License, and additional payments of $3,000,000 and $2,000,000 on the first and second anniversaries, respectively, of the effective date of the COH License. The terms also include milestone payments due upon the achievement of selected development, regulatory and sales events. The Company will also pay COH an annual royalty on net sales of products covered by the patents licensed from COH on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, subject to specified reductions.
Gedeptin License – On September 28, 2021, we entered into an Assignment and License Agreement (the “Gedeptin License”) with PNP Therapeutics, Inc. (“PNP”) under which the Company obtained exclusive worldwide rights to key intellectual property, including Gedeptin patents, know-how, regulatory filings, clinical materials, and trademarks. The Gedeptin patent portfolio was originally licensed from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) and Southern Research Institute (“SRI”) by PNP. Under the terms of the Gedeptin License, the Company is the successor to PNP under the Exclusive License Agreement between UAB, SRI and PNP, and has acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Gedeptin, a novel patented product for the treatment of solid tumors.
 
The terms of the Gedeptin License, include (i) an upfront payment at closing, (ii) milestone payments due upon the achievement of selected development and regulatory events, and (iii) quarterly support payments for the lesser period of three years or the Company’s filing for FDA approval of its Biologics License Application on the use of Gedeptin for the treatment of head and neck cancer in humans. The Company will also pay tiered percentage annual royalties in the low-to-mid teens on Net Sales (as defined in the Gedeptin License) of products covered under the Gedeptin License on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, subject to specified reductions. The Company also issued a warrant to PNP, exercisable at any time following March 28, 2022, and prior to September 28, 2026, for up to 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $13.00 per share. The Gedeptin License will remain in effect during the original term, which concludes upon FDA approval of a generic or biosimilar product, and then will automatically renew for 5-year additional terms, subject to customary termination rights.
 
NIH Licenses – On December 16, 2022, the Company entered into a Clinical Materials Transfer Agreement (MVA Vaccine Agreement) under which the Company has the right to develop and commercialize the unmodified (parental) MVA 1974/NTH Clone l strain as a vaccine against MPOX and SPOX.
 
On November 25, 2020, the Company entered into a Patent and Biological Materials License Agreement for Internal Research Use (the “Research License”) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as represented by NIAID, in support of the Company’s non-clinical development of vaccines against numerous pathogens. The Research License allows GeoVax to use these materials and patent rights owned by agencies of the HHS in combination with the Company’s proprietary technology for the creation of preventive and/or therapeutic Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus-Virus Like Particle (MVA-VLP) vaccines against Ebola-Zaire virus, Ebola-Sudan virus, Lassa virus, Marburg virus, Zika virus and malaria. The agreement also extends to the Company’s research and development efforts in certain oncology areas. The agreement provides GeoVax with nonexclusive rights for the nonclinical development and manufacturing of its vaccine and immunotherapy candidates using HHS patents and materials.
 
On October 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Patent and Biological Materials License Agreement (the “COVID License”) with HHS, as represented by NIAID, in support of the Company’s development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The COVID License allows GeoVax to use these materials and patent rights owned by agencies of the HHS in combination with the Company’s proprietary technology for the creation of a preventive Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus-Virus Like Particle (MVA-VLP) vaccine that primes and/or boosts the immune system against COVID-19. The COVID License provides GeoVax with nonexclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize its COVID-19 vaccine and includes access to NIAID’s patent rights in the stabilized SPIKE protein, which is the protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to gain entry into human tissue.

Research and Development
 
Our expenditures for research and development activities were $9.1 million and $15.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As our vaccines continue to go through the process to obtain regulatory approval, we expect our research and development costs to increase. We have not yet formulated any plans for marketing and sales of any vaccine candidate we may successfully develop. Compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date.
Scientific Advisors
 
We seek advice from our Scientific Advisory Board, which consists of a number of leading scientists, on scientific and medical matters. The current members of our Scientific Advisory Board are:

Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located in Smyrna, Georgia, where we lease approximately 8,400 square feet of office and laboratory space. Our lease for the premises is currently scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2025. We do not currently own any real property. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs, but that if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Human Capital Resources
 
We currently have fourteen full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our employee relations are good. We also engage consultants and independent contractors to fulfill key roles and/or provide expert services on both an ongoing and short-term basis.
 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive compensation, opportunity for equity ownership, and a robust employment package that promotes wellness across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare, retirement planning, and paid time off.
