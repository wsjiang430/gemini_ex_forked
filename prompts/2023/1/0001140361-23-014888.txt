Overview
 
Forian Inc. provides a unique suite of data management capabilities and proprietary information and analytics solutions to optimize and measure operational, clinical and financial performance for customers within the traditional and emerging life sciences and healthcare payer and provider industries.
 
Forian was founded on October 15, 2020, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Medical Outcomes Research Analytics, LLC (“MOR”), which was founded on May 6, 2019, in connection with the business combination transactions described below. On October 16, 2020, Forian entered into a definitive agreement with Helix Technologies, Inc. (“Helix”) and MOR, pursuant to which DNA Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Forian (“Merger Sub”), merged with and into Helix, with Helix surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Forian (the “Merger”). On March 2, 2021, Forian entered into a definitive agreement with the equity holders of MOR pursuant to which the equity holders of MOR contributed their interests in MOR to Forian in exchange for shares of Forian common stock (the “Contribution” and together with the Merger, the “Business Combination”). Following consummation of the Business Combination on March 2, 2021, Forian became the parent company of both Helix and MOR. On March 3, 2021, Forian’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “FORA.”
 



On February 10, 2023, Helix completed the sale of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Bio-Tech Medical Software, Inc., a Florida corporation (“BioTrack”), to BT Assets Group Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleaves Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Alleaves”) (the “BioTrack Transaction”). As a result of the BioTrack Transaction, as of February 10, 2023, we no longer provide software solutions to the cannabis industry. We retained certain license rights with respect to transactional data processed by the BioTrack point of sale software solution for use in our information offerings. For further discussion on the BioTrack Transaction, refer to “Note 20 – Subsequent Events” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 41 University Drive, Suite 400, Newtown, Pennsylvania 18940 and our primary website address is www.forian.com.

Our Business
 
Forian is derived from Greek work, plirofoía, meaning information or intelligence. At Forian, we are building a leading healthcare informatics and analytics solutions company. We leverage our expertise in data management and data science to generate information products and insights that improve our customers’ performance. Our solutions sit atop a massive and perpetually growing expanse of large-scale data assets. Our offerings include innovative commercial, Real World Evidence (“RWE”) and market access solutions and proprietary data-driven insights to optimize the operational, clinical and financial performance of our customers.
 
As the cost of healthcare delivery and research continues to expand rapidly, entities across the healthcare ecosystem are increasingly interested in the patient health journey to better understand the cost, value and efficacy of healthcare products and services in order to improve commercial effectiveness by targeting and segmenting customers more effectively and to understand access to products and services based on insurance coverage. Additionally, emerging therapeutics are increasingly becoming part of the patient journey and may offer greater pharmacoeconomic benefit and generate superior outcomes. However, adoption of alternative therapies is consistently thwarted by a lack of trusted information. Data on emerging therapeutics, such as cannabinoids and psychedelics, is typically difficult to acquire and neither standardized nor normalized and, consequently, patients, providers and payers are hesitant to leverage cannabinoids and psychedelics as therapeutics in the patient journey. Forian is uniquely positioned to overcome this challenge by leveraging cannabinoid data to provide mission critical clinical and commercial intelligence to customers across traditional healthcare and emerging therapeutic markets. Our agile structure has allowed us to build market-driven product and service offerings, as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that deliver value to customers at various stages of maturity by providing proprietary data insights to drive business and product innovation.
 
Our Markets
 
U.S. healthcare spending is roughly 18% of GDP, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expect the growth patterns to increase the spending back to roughly 20% of GDP following the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside the pandemic, the market has been expanding and evolving rapidly over the past decade due to an aging population, innovations in treatments and a reimagining of service delivery. There has been a growing emphasis on digitizing medical records and providing access to those records to providers and patients in support of more efficient and effective care. Disparate, unconnected systems, new diagnostics and treatment protocols are all generating new sources of data. In addition, data is being generated from retailers, social media and the internet. Collectively, the expansion of the volume and type of data has created challenges in making information interoperable and actionable. New and existing sources of data are often unstructured, preventing the seamless ability to derive valuable insights. New systems and solutions are needed to provide accessible and statistically significant data sets that offer the ability to conduct longitudinal analyses. The derived information and business intelligence is relevant to all healthcare stakeholders, and we believe there is an increasing need for the aggregation and integration of the large clinical data sets, irrespective of the source (e.g., traditional healthcare systems or emerging technologies).
 



The global market for healthcare analytics was approximately $17 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to an estimated $69 billion by 2025 according to BIS Research: Global Big Data in Healthcare Market; Analysis and Forecast, 2017-2025. We view this market in three principal segments: clinical analytics, commercial analytics and technology platform solutions. The market for clinical analytics includes RWE, health economics, outcomes research databases and analytic platforms as well as clinical data capture, clinical analytics and research services, investigator site and patient recruitment, observation studies and pharmacoeconomics. The market for commercial analytics includes customer segmentation and targeting, campaign measurement, longitudinal patient analytics and payer market access analytics. The market for technology platform solutions includes information technology, data management, data warehousing, IT outsourcing and software development.
 
We believe that RWE continues to drive value for all healthcare stakeholders. The proliferation of information technology and analytics extends well beyond life sciences. Information is critical to the ability for payers to manage and price risk effectively. The emergence of new data assets and technology have enabled better risk stratification, treatment protocol development and decision making relating to coverage of existing and emerging therapies. The ability to enter into value-based contracts is predicated on access to RWE related data and analytics.
 
Similarly, the healthcare delivery system is changing rapidly with telehealth and remote based monitoring become critical. As such, providers require more information to inform treatment decisions. This requires connectivity and access to their patients’ information including the use of over-the-counter and unapproved pharmaceutical treatments. Absent standards and the ability to capture and integrate these data into their medical records, they will lack the information required to guide the most effective treatments.
 
Institutional healthcare providers are losing large numbers of patients and large amounts of revenue due to changes in where and how healthcare is delivered, reduced demand for elective procedures due to COVID-19 and intense competition for customers and referrals. Provider profiling data, market supply and demand analytics and treatment protocol improvements all require information that we are well suited to deliver.
 
Life science companies need to fully understand how, when and why patients are treated with both traditional and alternative therapies. This understanding is incomplete without extending the understanding of the patient journey to emerging therapeutics, including cannabis-based treatments. Additionally, this evidence is also used to provide insights for product development, regulatory approval and monitoring of products after they have been released in the market.
    The use of cannabis for medical purposes is gaining momentum worldwide due to recent legalization and emerging research into therapeutic value and efficacy. Medical cannabis is used for the treatment of a growing array of diseases and chronic conditions, including but not limited to pain, inflammation, arthritis, anxiety, depression, epilepsy and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
 
Life science companies need to fully understand how, when and why patients are treated with both traditional and alternative therapies. This understanding is incomplete without extending the understanding of the patient journey to emerging therapeutics including cannabis-based treatments. Governments, manufacturers, cultivators and distributors as well as dispensaries need information on the safety and efficacy of cannabis in both medical and adult use settings. As legalization and usage expands rapidly, providers, patients and caregivers want more assurance of the quality and consistency of the products and insight into therapeutic alternatives for treatment of chronic conditions.
 
There is little to no understanding of the benefit of alternative therapeutic interventions used in place of or concomitantly with traditional therapeutics. The life science industry is currently investing in over 100 clinical trials for cannabis-based products which is indicative of these treatment alternatives becoming increasingly mainstream.
 
Our Offerings
 
Our mission is to provide our clients with superior information and analytical solutions that promote safer, more efficient and profitable business operations. Additionally, we strive to improve the health outcomes of patients by enabling our clients to serve their customers more comprehensively. Our ultimate goal is to empower our clients to make a positive impact on both their businesses and their customers’ well-being.
 



We have developed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), compliant repository of longitudinal de-identified patient health information in the United States. Our databases are updated weekly or monthly and include billions of de-identified patient events dating back to 2014 and represent the majority of the U.S. population. Our data factory processes, standardizes and integrates complex and disparate transactional data, such as medical, hospital and pharmacy claims, healthcare payer remittances, retail point of sale transactions and consumer demographics as well as social determinants of health. With deep domain knowledge, our team architected our technology platform to meet and exceed the strictest data privacy requirements in highly regulated industries. These integrated data are used to power multiple existing and in-development information products and services for customers across the healthcare industry.
 
Our products will assist our clients to better understand the value and efficacy of healthcare and emerging alternative therapeutics while providing critical business insights into our customers’ products, services, customers and the dynamics of a rapidly changing marketplace.
 
Technology & Information Products
 
Our information products provide a more complete patient treatment care pathways with comprehensive overviews of therapeutic interventions. By leveraging HIPAA-compliant processes, proprietary algorithms and technology, we have created a suite of information product offerings integrating data from siloed, disparate sources and platforms. This includes the intersection of traditional healthcare therapies with alternative therapeutics. We believe these offerings deliver unique and innovative key insights and value to our customers. We have contracted with multiple third-party data providers to license data that we believe is necessary to provide our information offerings. These agreements provide our clients solutions to drive clinical and commercial performance improvements. Our information products are largely subscription based, multiyear contracts providing solutions tailored to specific client needs to power innovative solutions for the healthcare market or used internally for commercial and clinical analytics. Information products are also purchased on a one-time basis as a custom report to meet a specific analytic need. These products typically provide normalized and aggregated market measures which our clients use to make investment, product, clinical, or other commercial decisions to maximize their return on investment.
 
In the creation of our information products, we leverage various deterministic and probabilistic matching techniques that work on hashed and encrypted data to both ensure accurate patient matching and enumeration while maintaining patient/customer privacy. As new patients/customers are constantly entering the system, this is not a moment-in-time function, but rather an ongoing process that needs to be carefully managed and continuously tested to ensure low rates of false positive and false negative matches.
 
Our technology products offered to the cannabis industry prior to the BioTrack Transaction included the BioTrack™ vertically integrated point of sale, manufacturing, delivery and cultivator software solution and the Cannalytics ® SaaS-based analytics solution. The BioTrack™   solution was first introduced in 2010 and is among the most tenured and largest commercial platforms in the cannabis industry, serving dispensaries, cultivators, manufacturers and distributors within 38 states and Puerto Rico as of the date of the BioTrack Transaction. The Cannalytics® solution is a software-as-a-service that enables customers across the legal cannabis industry to better attract and retain customers, purchase, distribute and invest in products and understand marketplace dynamics that impact business performance. As a result of the BioTrack Transaction, we no longer offer these products.
 



Services
 
We continue to develop RWE and data management solutions to assist customers seeking to understand the safety, efficacy, and therapeutics of traditional and emerging therapies. Our project-based RWE solutions are designed to enable the integration otherwise unconnected and disparate data to enable near real-time surveillance of adverse events and to study the clinical economic and social impacts of various therapeutic alternatives, including those derived from cannabinoids and psychedelics. These solutions will enable up to clinical-grade observational research to be conducted to evaluate the impact of emerging therapies on patient outcomes and as alternatives to existing therapies and will support:

• | the delivery of evidence-based insight into the safety and efficacy of ethical pharmaceuticals and emerging therapies to pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, caregivers, payers and patients with credible evidence to improve patient care and health outcomes; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the empowerment of regulators to more-granularly assess the safety, health, social and economic outcomes associated with all therapeutic options as the cannabis market scales and emerging therapies are adopted as mainstream therapeutic alternatives; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the creation of new standards for product and treatment classification in emerging therapeutic markets where no existing or widely adopted standards exist today.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our data management solutions will enable our customers to leverage their own proprietary data independently or integrated with our data assets. We have the ability to clean, standardize, normalize and integrate information in a privacy compliant way. We are further developing our proprietary reference data assets, ontologies and patient and customer masters, each to be used as the standard to which customer data can be mapped and standardized for analytic purposes. These cleansed data can be used as the foundation of our information products, RWE solutions, custom analytics and reporting, or provided back to our clients to be used within their own operational and analytics processes. Clients can leverage these services on a one time or repeatable basis depending on their specific needs.
 
As of the date of the BioTrack Transaction, the BioTrack™ seed-to-sale compliance traceability platform was used by 10 state regulatory agencies (including Puerto Rico) to manage the tracking and tracing of all cannabis products from cultivation to sale and 2 state regulatory agencies contract with BioTrack to manage cannabis patient registries. As legalization at the state level in the United States continues for both medical and expanding adult use, seed-to-sale tracking will be the foundational compliance tool used by governments to regulate the extensive legal cannabis market. The BioTrack™ State Traceability & Enforcement Monitoring System includes all the components needed to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the entire cannabis supply chain while promoting public safety. The BioTrack™ State Traceability & Enforcement Monitoring System was included in the BioTrack Transaction, and as a result we no longer offer these services effective February 10, 2023.

Our Technology Platform
 
Our unique software, data and analytics platforms are built upon scalable open source software running in the public cloud. This architecture allows us to capitalize on the security, reliability and scalability of mainstream cloud providers while building uniquely differentiated algorithms and data handling methodologies. Our use of elastic computing allows us to allocate computer clusters on-demand at scale to process terabytes of data in minutes. We are able to answer complex consumer behavior or life sciences questions quickly without having to maintain servers or pay for idle compute resources.
 



Our event-driven data factory architecture ingests, cleans, anonymizes and transforms health, consumer and retail records as available rather than on a fixed schedule. As data updates are observed from disparate sources, they are propagated through all pipeline stages, ensuring customers have the latest data in near real time. Through the use of open-source technologies, our big data processing pipelines are streamlined and can more easily handle changes in data schema, “data drift”, and the updating and deleting of existing records compliant with policies such as HIPAA, the California Consumer Privacy Act and emerging state privacy regulations. Capabilities like “time-travel” enabled by Delta Lake storage formats allow for full versioning of all data over time so that we observe a record throughout its entire lifecycle. Our architecture natively supports “schema evolution” allowing for flexibility to bring in new fields of data as they become available as well as handle backward-compatible changes in data types over time.
 
Our proprietary solutions provide fully de-identified records in isolated clearinghouses using leading technologies paired with statistical certification by industry-vertical experts. Our solutions join records longitudinally over time, as well as across data sources. This allows for superior flexibility for analysis and use case development while maintaining security and mitigating reidentification risk.
 
We maintain System and Organization Controls (SOC 2) Type 2 and Privacy certifications across our platforms. We conduct our day-to-day operations in accordance with policies and procedures to mitigate risks associated with our trust policies including security, availability, processing integrity and confidentiality of our systems, products and services. The SOC 2 and Privacy programs are audited by an independent third party on an annual basis.
 
Competition
 
While the healthcare industry includes well-capitalized, experienced competitors, we believe our unique data assets, synergies, intellectual property and experienced leadership offer us competitive advantages. In general, our competitors include a variety of entities such as information and clinical analytics providers such as ICON plc, information and commercial analytics providers such as IQVIA, technology and services provers such as Veeva Systems, Inc. and Definitive Healthcare Corp. and client in-house developed technologies.
Government Regulation
 
Our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding de-identified patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are, therefore, subject to substantial governmental regulation. In addition, the confidentiality of patient-specific information and the circumstances under which such patient-specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated. Federal, state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession, use and dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information and personal financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation de-identified health or other data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services.
 
In particular, personal health information is recognized in many countries and regions such as the United States, the European Union, or EU, and several countries in Asia, as a special, sensitive category of personal information, subject to additional mandatory protections. Violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties and criminal prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.
 
Our technology processes, normalizes, standardizes, and integrates complex and disparate transactional data, such as medical, hospital and pharmacy claims data, retail point of sale transactions and consumer demographic data. We have developed our platform with strict, HIPAA-compliant privacy controls enabling linkages between the transactional data sources while maintaining patient, consumer, and customer privacy. All data are de-identified at the person level, enabling longitudinal, credible, evidence-based assessments relating to product safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes as well as commercial analytics.
 



Intellectual Property
 
In addition to our expansive data sets described above, we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, software and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of legal, technical and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We consider our trademark and related names, marks and logos to be of material importance to our business, and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks in the United States and will aggressively seek to protect them. Trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. The technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are of importance to our business, although our management believes that our business, as a whole, is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties.
Human Capital Resources
 
The foundation of our software, data and analytics solutions is our people, and the level of our success in helping our customers solve problems is a direct function of our commitment to our employees. Our intent is to continue to build a first-class organization premised on the importance of our contribution to customer success while remaining ever conscious of our responsibility to our employees and the communities in which we operate.
 
We are committed to equity and fairness in honoring our commitment to our employees. As set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, diversity across gender, race, ethnicity, religion, politics, sexual orientation, age, experience and thought enhances our ability to support our customers, suppliers, partners and employees. In fostering a culture of inclusion, we enable each of us to present our authentic selves in our dealings with the people with whom we interact, and in so doing allow us to be more effective and impactful in the performance of our responsibilities. We embrace the opportunity to enable our customers to better serve their customers and continually seek to improve the value we bring, all while maintaining a critical balance between our employees’ work with colleagues and customers and their lives outside of Forian.
 
In order to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we transitioned to remote work and continue to engage with and support our employees as they serve one another and our customers remotely.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 104 employees, 102 of whom were full time. As of March 27, 2023, after giving effect to the BioTrack Transaction, we had 39 employees, 38 of whom are full time. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any organized work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.
