Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing our differentiated platform primarily to discover and develop novel antibody-based therapeutics to treat a range of solid tumor types. While more traditional oncology drug discovery approaches attempt to generate antibodies against known targets, our approach relies on the human immune system to direct us to unique antibody-target pairs from patients experiencing a clinically meaningful, active immune response against their tumors. These unique antibody-target pairs represent a potentially novel and previously unexplored landscape of oncology targets. We believe the fact that our approach has the potential to deliver novel, previously unexplored oncology targets provides us with a significant competitive advantage over traditional approaches, which focus on known targets that many companies are aware of and can pursue. We have utilized our drug discovery approach to identify over 2,000 distinct human antibodies that bind preferentially to tumor tissue from patients who are not the source of the antibody. 
Our most advanced product candidate, ATRC-101, is a monoclonal antibody with a novel mechanism of action and target derived from an antibody identified using our discovery platform. ATRC-101 reacts in vitro with a majority of human ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and breast cancer samples from multiple patients. It has demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in multiple preclinical models, including one model in which PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors typically display limited activity. In 2020, we commenced clinical development of ATRC-101 with a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating ATRC-101 as a monotherapy in patients with select solid tumors which is ongoing, and in 2021 we expanded clinical development by opening a new cohort to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of subjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies positive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a CAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well tolerated, and we have observed longer progression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study. Enrollment in both cohorts is ongoing, and 69 participants have been enrolled and dosed as of December 31, 2022. We expect additional data from both cohorts over the course of 2023, and we expect to make potential Phase 2 development decisions in late 2023.
Our efforts beyond ATRC-101 are focused on expanding our clinical pipeline by advancing additional product candidates using our discovery platform. We expect the focus of our pre-clinical development efforts will be on lead-stage oncology programs, including APN-497444, an ADC against a novel tumor glycan target, and APN-346958, a CD3 bispecific T-cell engager against an RNA-binding protein target. We continue to aim for one additional IND per year in oncology with our next IND targeted in late 2024. In addition, we continue to develop our platform capabilities and to expand the weaponization technologies we have access to so that we can combine the novel antibodies that are generated by our platform with these antibody weaponization technologies to generate clinical candidates. In February 2023, we announced the first joint program, mutually selected with Xencor, Inc., or Xencor, for advancement under our existing strategic collaboration, combining an Atreca-discovered antibody with Xencor’s XmAb® bispecific Fc domain and a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain or CD3. The joint program is based on APN-346958, an Atreca-discovered antibody. APN-346958 recognizes an RNA-binding protein that is normally sequestered in the nucleus but is mislocalized to the cell surface in tumors. In preclinical studies, the XmAb bispecific antibody engineered against APN-346958’s target has demonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity and robust immune activation as evidenced by an increase in IFN gamma levels in plasma, and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the blood. Atreca and Xencor targeted to name a candidate from the program later in 2023, and Atreca targets an IND submission by early 2025.
In April 2022, we provided an update on our preclinical pipeline in oncology, and we announced our next clinical candidate, ATRC-301. ATRC-301 is an antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, that selectively targets a novel, membrane-proximal epitope on erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2, or EphA2. We initiated IND-enabling studies for ATRC-301, including a non-human primate toxicology study in September 2022. In November 2022, we announced that this study revealed safety signals, including bleeding, and as a result, we discontinued the development of ATRC-301. We continue to evaluate our anti-EphA2 antibodies in multiple weaponized formats.

Beyond oncology, in October 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute or Gates MRI to allow Gates MRI to develop and commercialize MAM01/ATRC-501 for the prevention of malaria in GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, eligible countries located in malaria-endemic regions of the world, to advance its charitable purposes. MAM01/ATRC-501 is an engineered version of an antibody that we discovered using our platform that targets the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan that causes the deadliest form of malaria. In November 2022, we announced that an IND for MAM01/ATRC-501 is expected to be filed by Gates MRI in the first half of 2023, and that Gates MRI expects to commence clinical development by the second half of 2023. We retain commercial rights in the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia, and potential product development opportunities in those regions include prevention of malaria for those traveling to malaria endemic regions.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company by utilizing our differentiated platform to discover and develop antibody-based therapeutics against novel targets. In pursuit of that strategy, we intend to:

◾ | Rapidly advance our most advanced product candidate, ATRC-101, through clinical trials in multiple types of solid tumors. ATRC-101 is the first candidate identified using our discovery platform that has advanced into a clinical trial. ATRC-101 displays broad reactivity across a variety of human solid tumor samples and has demonstrated potent single-agent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models via a unique mechanism of action, which we term Driver Antigen Engagement. In February 2020, we commenced clinical studies to evaluate ATRC-101 in a monotherapy setting and in September 2021 we opened a new cohort to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of subjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies positive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a CAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well tolerated, and we have observed longer progression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study. We may also evaluate this candidate in combination with other agents in one or more solid tumors in the future.

◾ | Continue efforts to develop a pipeline of antibody-based product candidates for oncology. While our only product candidate that is currently in clinical development is ATRC-101, we have utilized our differentiated drug discovery approach to identify over 2,000 distinct human antibodies targeting human tumors that can potentially provide the basis for additional product candidates. Our ongoing efforts are focused on identifying, analyzing and refining antibodies to generate clinical candidates that take advantage of various mechanisms of action and novel targets. We engineer some of our antibodies into various drug formats, such as ADCs and T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, to drive anti-tumor activity. We intend to build out a proprietary pipeline of product candidates addressing large populations of patients across a range of solid tumors. We currently own worldwide rights to the oncology product candidates derived from our platform. Product candidates developed pursuant to activities undertaken with our collaborators may be subject to certain collaborator rights.

◾ | Selectively enter into collaborations to enhance and expand our product pipeline as well as our drug development capabilities. We believe that the single agent anti-tumor activity of many of the antibodies discovered using our platform could be enhanced by incorporating potential collaborator technologies. We intend to continue to selectively form collaborations with partners to gain access to complementary technologies and expertise in order to develop product candidates with increased potential for anti-tumor activity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Continue to invest in our discovery platform to further enhance our ability to identify novel antibodies and to generate clinical candidates from our growing hit library. A key pillar of our discovery platform is our proprietary sample repository, which includes over 1,800 blood-derived samples sourced from over 500 patients representing over 30 different types of solid tumors. We plan to expand the scope of our repository and enhance other portions of our platform in order to maintain our leadership position in the discovery of novel targets including hematologic malignancies, non-autologous tumor tissue and antibodies that bind to them. We also plan to continue to enhance our capabilities to translate these proprietary findings into product candidates such as through further expansion of our target identification capabilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Selectively enter into drug discovery partnerships with other life sciences companies to leverage the breadth and scale of our discovery platform. Our discovery platform has been optimized to allow us to operate effectively at scale, and by entering into discovery collaborations with larger pharma and biotech

companies we believe we can generate significant non-dilutive capital via upfront payments, cost reimbursement, milestones and ultimately royalties. Given the significant need in oncology for novel targets, and antibodies that target them as potential therapeutics, leveraging our platform in this manner can be an efficient way to help support the capital requirements of the platform both for our internal use as well as for the needs of our potential partners.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio to further protect our discovery platform and the novel product candidates it may generate. The intellectual property surrounding our platform consists of patents and patent applications, trade secrets and know-how, and we plan to expand our intellectual property as we continue to develop our platform. We also intend to protect our product candidates by pursuing composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents typical for antibody-based therapeutics. Furthermore, as our platform identifies novel antibody-target pairs in which a human antibody may bind to a previously underappreciated target in a useful manner, we plan to pursue additional intellectual property supporting our candidates deriving from their interactions with targets.

​
The Atreca Drug Discovery Platform
We believe we may be able to address certain key limitations of the current oncology drug discovery paradigm by focusing on the common phenomenon driving clinical responses in cancer immunotherapy—an active human anti-tumor immune response. Our platform allows us to interrogate an active B cell response within an individual cancer patient to identify novel and relevant antibodies and their targets, which may enable us to develop antibody-based product candidates to treat large populations of patients with solid tumors. We believe that the significant time and capital invested in developing, refining and applying our differentiated discovery platform have provided us with significant first-mover advantages and created barriers to entry.
For example, establishing our non-interventional clinical studies to obtain patient samples, enabling longitudinal analyses, required approximately 1 to 2 years per study. We have built our bioinformatics expertise in assembling and analyzing our antibodies over nine years of operations. Our hit antibody generation process has been enhanced to deliver hits at a high rate, has already generated over 2,000 hit antibodies and is supported by a growing intellectual property portfolio. Additionally, our investments of capital and time to build industrialized wet-lab and supporting bioinformatics capacity across our platform, including the time required to identify and hire very qualified personnel, were substantial.
Our discovery process begins by gathering blood samples, mostly through company-sponsored non-interventional clinical studies, from cancer patients before, during and after they undergo treatment, which can induce an active anti-tumor immune response. Through this process, we have built a broad repository of over 1,800 samples from over 500 donors, representing over 30 different solid tumor types. We then examine these samples for rare antibody-producing B cells called plasmablasts that are normally elevated during an active immune response. We believe that these human immune responses, which often occur over an extended period of time, generate antibodies accessible with our platform that would be difficult to obtain through shorter term, non-human immunization or in vitro strategies.
From the plasmablasts in a particular sample, we then employ a multi-step process to generate a potential product candidate. We start by isolating single plasmablasts and determining the sequences of the co-expressed antibody genes using our proprietary Immune Repertoire Capture® technology. We analyze these sequences to select antibodies, which we synthesize as recombinant proteins. We then test these antibodies to identify those that bind to tumor tissue from patients who are not the source of the antibody, referred to as non-autologous tumor tissue, preferentially over normal tissue. We then analyze these "hit" antibodies using a number of in vitro and in vivo assays, and often make structural changes to generate leads. A select number of these leads are refined further using protein engineering to enhance their drug-like properties as we identify and characterize their targets in parallel prior to initiating preclinical development and IND-enabling studies.

Key Attributes of Our Discovery Platform
We take an "open-aperture" approach to drug discovery, in which we are not limited by preconceptions of what constitutes a viable antibody or target. We instead allow the human immune system to direct our efforts. We believe this approach provides us access to a broad underexploited antibody and drug target space. Our approach may lead us to antibodies that are unlikely to have arisen via more traditional approaches with targets or epitopes that otherwise may not have been discoverable. We believe our approach and discovery platform provide us with the ability to:

◾ | Generate antibodies made by the human immune system.
--+-----------------------------------------------------


◾ | Deliver potentially useful antibodies at a high rate and in a scalable fashion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Access a potentially large and underexploited tumor target space.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Identify antibodies useful for targeting tumor tissue and their targets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Generate candidates that attack tumor tissue.
--+----------------------------------------------


◾ | Develop potential treatments for large populations of patients across multiple tumor types.

Pipeline Programs
ATRC-101
ATRC-101 is a monoclonal antibody derived from an antibody identified using our discovery platform in the active immune response of a patient. We believe that ATRC-101 may have broad potential as an immunotherapeutic agent in a range of solid tumors. ATRC-101 reacts in vitro with a majority of human ovarian, non-small cell lung, colorectal and breast cancer samples from multiple patients. It has also demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in multiple preclinical syngeneic tumor models, including one model in which PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors typically display limited activity. ATRC-101 has also demonstrated preclinical activity in combination with other immunotherapeutics, including PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, and we have demonstrated that certain chemotherapeutic agents can drive expression of the target of ATRC-101 in a variety of solid tumors. Both the mechanism of action of ATRC-101, which we refer to as Driver Antigen Engagement, and its target appear unlike those of other anti-tumor antibodies that have been or are currently in clinical development. In histology studies, we did not observe binding above background levels across a range of normal human tissues. Additionally, in repeat-dose safety studies in both mice and non-human primates, we did not observe a safety signal. We have identified the target of ATRC-101 as a ribonucleoprotein, or RNP, complex, containing RNA and a number of RNA binding proteins, to which ATRC-101 binds via a tumor-specific epitope.
We believe the mechanism of action of ATRC-101 involves systemic delivery of an agent targeting a RNP, which causes remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and the destruction of tumor cells via activating first the innate immune system, which then leads to an adaptive immune response that targets tumor tissue. While we believe that this mechanism is novel for a candidate therapeutic in oncology, the mechanism is known to drive immune responses in humans in autoimmune and infectious disease. With our knowledge of the target of ATRC-101, we believe other targets may exist that are capable of driving such activity when bound by an antibody.
We launched an open-label dose escalation monotherapy trial in patients with solid tumors in early 2020 and advanced into monotherapy expansion cohorts in 2021 based on the activity and safety profile we observed in the dose escalation portion of the study. We also opened a new cohort in late 2021 to evaluate ATRC-101 in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor and we may explore ATRC-101 in combination with other agents as well, including with potentially select chemotherapeutics. In 2022, we began limiting enrollment of subjects in our clinical trials to those with biopsies positive for the target of ATRC-101 as determined by a CAP-CLIA certified assay. To date, ATRC-101 continues to be well tolerated, and we have observed longer progression free survival in patients with high target expression in this study. ATRC-101 demonstrates the ability of our platform to generate antibody candidates with novel targets and mechanisms of action.
We own worldwide rights to ATRC-101. We have filed multiple U.S. provisional patent applications relating to ATRC-101 and its variants. In February 2020, we filed a nonprovisional patent application in the U.S., an international 

- 11 -



patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, and a patent application in Taiwan, each relating to ATRC-101 and its variants. 
ATRC-501/MAM01
ATRC-501 is an engineered version of an antibody that we discovered using our platform that targets the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan that causes the deadliest form of malaria. We have entered into a licensing agreement with the Gates MRI for the development and commercialization of MAM01/ATRC-501 for the prevention of malaria. Under the agreement, Gates MRI will lead the development of MAM01/ATRC-501 and receive commercial rights in GAVI-eligible countries located in malaria-endemic regions of the world, while Atreca will retain commercial rights in the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia. Potential product development opportunities for Atreca include developing MAM01/ATRC-501 for prevention of malaria for those traveling to regions where the infection may be circulating.
In support of our efforts to improve the potency of MAM01/ATRC-501, in October 2022, we entered into the Grant Agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under which we were awarded a grant totaling up to $1.2 million for our continued work on the malaria program. 
Weaponization Approaches
The adaptive immune response against tumor tissue in a patient, from which our platform identifies hit antibodies, generates antibodies that often recognize tumor tissue, but not necessarily those, delivered as a monoclonal, that can cause potent tumor cell killing via binding of these “naked” antibodies to their targets. In order to drive tumor cell killing using tumor-targeting antibodies, such antibodies can be “weaponized” to include additional protein domains or small molecules that engage both immunotherapeutic and other mechanisms. Two such weaponization approaches that we are pursuing are building T cell engagers and ADCs.
T cell engagers
Our hit antibodies are defined by their ability to react with non-autologous tumor tissue preferentially over normal adjacent tissue. In principle, therefore, their Fv regions can be used to direct cells of the immune system, such as T cells, to tumor cells. Furthermore, if the T cells can be activated when they are brought to the tumor cell, then tumor cell killing can occur. This "T cell engagement" is a well-validated approach utilized in both approved and clinical stage products. In this approach, tumor-targeting domains derived from antibodies are linked to protein domains that typically bind to a particular protein (e.g., CD3 or CD137/4-1BB) on the surface of T cells, both bringing the T cell to the tumor cell while simultaneously activating it. These antibody-derived biologics are sometimes termed "bispecific", in that they are capable of binding to two different targets: the tumor target and the T cell target.
We are pursuing the discovery and development of bispecifics using our proprietary collection of novel tumor-targeting antibodies. To screen for the potential utility of an antibody-target pair, we first use antibody sequence information to create a bispecific T cell engager in one or more formats. We then test this bispecific for activity in vitro in industry-standard assays for T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or TDCC. In these assays, primary human T cells isolated from a patient blood sample are co-incubated with tumor cells. The bispecific, in which the antibody-derived portion from our hit library is known to interact with the tumor cell, is added into the assay, and tumor cell killing is assessed over time. In this assay, a number of our hit antibodies converted into bispecifics display significant tumor cell killing activity. 
In July 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Xencor to research, develop and commercialize novel CD3 bispecific antibodies as potential therapeutics in oncology. This agreement calls for a three-year research program in which we will provide antibodies against novel tumor targets through our discovery platform from which Xencor. will engineer XmAb bispecific antibodies that also bind to the CD3 receptor on T cells. 
In February 2023, we announced the first joint program, mutually selected with Xencor under our existing strategic collaboration, combining an Atreca-discovered antibody with Xencor’s XmAb® bispecific Fc domain and a 

- 12 -



cytotoxic T-cell binding domain CD3. The joint program is based on APN-346958, an Atreca-discovered antibody. APN-346958 recognizes an RNA-binding protein that is normally sequestered in the nucleus but is mislocalized to the cell surface in tumors. In preclinical studies, the XmAb bispecific antibody engineered against APN-346958’s target has demonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity and robust immune activation as evidenced by an increase in IFN gamma levels in plasma, and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the blood. Atreca and Xencor expect to name a candidate from the program later this year and Atreca target an IND submission no later than early 2025.
In the future, we also may selectively pursue additional partnerships to access additional bispecific formats, technologies and know-how in order to discover and develop T cell engagers based on novel antibody-target pairs discovered using our platform.
Antibody-drug conjugates
Cellular toxins can be conjugated to certain antibodies to generate cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing their targets. Such ADCs require antibodies that internalize upon binding to their target. Once antibodies internalize, they also must be delivered to an intracellular compartment suitable for release of the toxin into the cell.
We have established in vitro assays to assess first whether our hit antibodies can internalize once they bind to their targets on tumor cells, and if they internalize, then whether they can deliver a toxin to an internal compartment such that the toxin is released to kill the cells. Our second assay measures cytotoxicity as driven by release of toxin bound to an internalized antibody (a cytotoxic payload). In this assay, internalizing hit antibodies are pre-incubated with a second antibody that is both capable of binding the internalizing antibody and has a conjugated cytotoxin. The pre-incubated antibody mixture is then incubated with tumor cells for a period of time, and cell killing is measured.
​
Our ADC strategy includes pursuing partnerships to access technologies and know-how to discover and develop product candidates with an ADC mechanism of action based on novel antibody-target pairs discovered using our platform. In April 2022 we announced we had entered into a License Agreement with Zymeworks Inc., or Zymeworks, which provided a two year research term for us to utilize their ZymeLink™ technology to develop novel ADCs. In addition, we announced our next clinical candidate, ATRC-301 which was an ADC utilizing the ZymeLink technology that selectively targets a novel, membrane-proximal epitope on erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2, or EphA2. We initiated IND-enabling studies for ATRC-301, including a non-human primate toxicology study in September 2022. In November 2022, we announced that this study revealed safety signals, including bleeding, and as a result, we discontinued the development of ATRC-301. As a result, we are only evaluating our anti-EphA2 antibodies in other weaponized formats; however, we continue to evaluate many of our antibodies in an ADC format, including APN-497444, which is being evaluated as an ADC against a novel tumor glycan target.
​
Manufacturing
We use a third-party manufacturer to produce our antibodies and reagents for use in preclinical assessment of product candidates. We do not have, and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the infrastructure, facilities or capabilities to manufacture current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials. We intend to continue to utilize third-party manufacturers such as contract development manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to produce, test and release cGMP bulk drug substance and drug product for our planned clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on such third parties to manufacture clinical trial material for the foreseeable future. We currently have a service agreement with a CDMO to develop and manufacture material in support of our Phase 1b clinical studies, and engaged with additional CDMOs as potential suppliers to ensure sufficient clinical material for our existing trials and provides a path to generate the required manufacturing information that is part of a BLA and initial commercial supplies.
Our current and expected future contractual CDMOs have a long, successful track record of manufacturing products for other companies under cGMP compliance and have previously been inspected by regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP standards.

Competition
We are aware of a number of companies that are developing antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Many of these companies are well-capitalized and, in contrast to us, have significant clinical, regulatory, and commercial experience, and may include our potential future partners. In addition, these companies compete with us in recruiting scientific and managerial talent. Our success will partially depend on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patents and other intellectual property rights with respect to antibodies that are safer and more effective than competing products. Our commercial opportunity and success will be reduced or eliminated if competing products that are safer, more effective, or less expensive than the antibodies we develop are or become available.
We expect to compete with antibody, biologics and other therapeutic platforms and development companies who are also pursuing a similar discovery approach, including, but not limited to, companies such as Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, Neurimmune Holding AG, OncoResponse, Inc., Immunome, Inc., and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. In addition, we expect to compete with large, multinational pharmaceutical companies that discover, develop and commercialize antibodies and other therapeutics for use in treating cancer such as AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Genentech, Inc. and Merck & Co., Inc. If ATRC-101 or potential future product candidates are eventually approved, they will compete with a range of treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. For example, we expect that ATRC-101 and our potential future product candidates may compete against traditional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, as well as cell-based treatments for cancer, such as CAR-T therapies. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.
Intellectual Property
Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel antibody-based immunotherapeutics to treat a range of solid tumors, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our discovery platform, novel discoveries, and other important technology inventions and know-how. We rely, for example, on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary innovations.
As set out in "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property," under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or may be insufficient to permit us to preserve or improve our competitive position.
Our intellectual property includes a portfolio of in-licensed and Atreca-owned patents and patent applications, relating to our discovery platform and the novel product candidates developed using that platform, including compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of treatment, diagnostics, and kits. Our lead immunotherapeutic product candidate, ATRC-101, is a monoclonal antibody with preclinical anti-tumor activity and is a variant of an antibody identified using our discovery platform.

U.S. biological products development process
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. These laws and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
​
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
​

◾ | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each study may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to ship an unapproved, investigational product in interstate commerce and to administer it to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds or partial clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other considerations, unreasonable and significant safety risk, inability to assess safety risk, lack of qualified investigators, a misleading or materially incomplete investigator brochure, or study design deficiencies. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues or circumstances will not arise that delay, suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor's control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial and its related documentation must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

◾ | Phase 1. The biological product is studied in oncology indications, and the investigational product is initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These randomized clinical trials
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 16 -




are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and physician labeling.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, the FDA requires extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor's data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, emphasis is placed on the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review in total typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or 

- 17 -



clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or drug-drug interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product's safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
​
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These 

- 18 -



programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received fast track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted.
Under the FDA's breakthrough therapy program, products may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if they are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation plus the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible.
Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA's goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Post-approval requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. As the manufacturer of our products we are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, we are required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, we shall submit samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
We also must comply with the FDA's advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described 

- 19 -



in the product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use,, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial actions, civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Government regulation outside of the United States
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
​
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations, some of which are described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration 

- 20 -



intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their covered subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA.
Further, pursuant to the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created as part of the ACA, certain manufacturers of prescription drugs are required to collect and report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) , other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
In addition, several states now require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to 

- 21 -



implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a biopharmaceutical manufacturer's operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management's attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
U.S. healthcare reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The biopharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
There have been executive and Congressional efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the coverage gap known as the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. The ACA may be subject to additional judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. 
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which biopharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, in September 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, 

- 22 -



restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of biopharmaceutical products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products in the United States can differ significantly from payor to payor. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any biological product that is approved for sale, a biopharmaceutical manufacturer may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product. A payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, will apply to our companion diagnostics.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company's revenue generated from the sale of any approved drug or biological product. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug or biological products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

COVID-19 Response​
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and maintained health and safety standards and protocols for our onsite employees and enhanced our employee benefit programs. We have created a flexible work policy to enable employees to work remotely and expanded our ergonomic assessment program to support the safety and comfort of remote work. We require our onsite employees to adhere to our COVID-19 safety protocols as recommended by federal, state and local guidance, and we cover the cost of all COVID-19 testing for onsite employees. In addition, we have enhanced our mental health offerings, supported dynamic work schedules for working parents, and bolstered employees’ ability to use individual sick time.
