Item 1. Business
Background and Overview 
 
Sharps Technology, Inc. is a medical device company that has designed and patented various safety syringes and is seeking to commercialize them. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in the first quarter of 2022. Sharps was incorporated to purchase, develop, and commercialize a body of intellectual property resulting in a family of smart safety syringe products. Sharps closed the acquisition of this intellectual property in the fourth quarter of 2017. The intellectual property we purchased consisted of issued patent and patent files, new designs and iterations, samples, regulatory files, manufacturing files, product testing files, and market research files relating to such safety syringe products.
 
In June 2020, we entered into an asset/share purchase agreement with Safegard Medical Kft. and certain other parties, and in August 2020, October 2020, and July 2021, we entered into amendments to this agreement (as amended, the “Safegard Agreement”). Under the Safegard Agreement, we received an option to purchase either the stock of Safegard or certain assets of Safegard, including the Securegard product line of safety syringes and a manufacturing facility in Hungary, registered with the FDA and CE, for the manufacture of safety syringes, for $2.5 million in cash plus additional consideration of 28,571 shares of common stock and 35,714 stock options with an exercise price of $7.00 USD. Under the Safegard Agreement, Sharps was granted the right to operate the facility in Hungary at our expense and continued to do so through the closing date which occurred on July 6, 2022.
 
Sharps’ smart safety syringe products, which we refer to as Securgard™ and Sharps Provensa™, are ultra-low waste syringes that incorporate both safety and reuse prevention features, which we believe will provide us a competitive advantage over other syringes. The Sharps Securegard is a multi-feature safety syringe that had gained market acceptance prior to Sharps’ acquisition but not been marketed or sold for several years due to a decision by the owners to wind down the business. It is both FDA and WHO approved and carries the European CE Mark. The Sharps Provensa is a patented safety syringe that gained FDA clearance for subcutaneous and intramuscular injections in June 2006. Both of these product lines are focused on innovatively addressing the important needs of the global healthcare market in the area of disposable syringes.
 
On September 29, 2022, the Sharps Technology entered into an agreement (the “Nephron Agreement”) with InjectEZ, LLC (“InjectEZ”), Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“NPC”), Nephron SC, Inc. (“NSC”), and Nephron Sterile Compounding Center LLC (“Sterile”) (NPC, NSC, and Sterile are sometimes collectively referred to as “Nephron”), pursuant to which Sharps will provide technical advice and assistance to support manufacturing by InjectEZ, purchase certain quantities of syringes as they may order or require, and collaborate with Nephron on certain related business endeavors. The Nephron Agreement is for a period of four (4) years, expiring on September 28, 2026 and continues thereafter for successive one (1) year periods. The Agreement includes provisions for collaborations in the areas of Manufacturing and Supply, a Pharma Services Program, and Distribution, as detailed below. NPC is a West Columbia, S.C.-based company that develops and produces safe, affordable generic inhalation solutions and suspension products. NPC also operates an industry-leading 503B Outsourcing Facility division, which produces pre-filled sterile syringes, luer-lock vials, IV bottles and IV bags for hospitals across America, in an effort to alleviate drug shortage needs. NPC launched a CLIA-certified diagnostics lab in 2020 where it tests people for COVID-19 and administers vaccinations.
 
Through the Nephron Agreement, Sharps is entering into a manufacturing and supply agreement with InjectEZ regarding the development and manufacture of high value pre-fillable syringe systems that can be used by the healthcare industry, pharmaceutical markets and including Nephron on terms agreed upon by the parties. The Nephron Agreement will allow for the supply of the pre-fillable systems of different sizes and with specialized technology that will be compatible with industry standards and technology beginning in the third quarter, as recently advised by Nephron. The Agreement also allows for further expansion of manufacturing capabilities by Sharps Technology working with InjectEZ to support future industry and customer demand of pre-fillable systems as detailed in the Agreement.
 
Additionally, Sharps is entering into a Pharma Services Program (PSP) with Nephron that will create new business development growth opportunities for both companies. These opportunities will include the development and sale of next generation drug delivery systems that will be produced by Sharps and can be purchased by the healthcare industry, pharmaceutical markets, as well as by Nephron.

On December 8, 2022, Sharps entered into a distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Nephron Pharmaceuticals pursuant to which the Sharps Technology appointed Nephron as its exclusive distributor for the sale and distribution of the products subject to the Distribution Agreement in and throughout the United States. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the price of shipping products will be based on the cost of delivery to Nephron’s warehouse and the Company will pay for the cost of delivery to Nephron. The Distribution Agreement has a term of two years and will continue in effect unless either party notifies the other party of its desire to terminate. At any time and for any reason, either party can terminate the Distribution Agreement after thirty (30) days’ notice and in the event of a breach of any of the Distribution Agreement’s terms and provisions, either party can terminate the Distribution Agreement by providing 90 days written notice. The Company has the right to terminate the Distribution Agreement with 60 days written notice in the event that certain conditions are met as set forth in the Distribution.
 
Although we currently have production capacity for our products and thus ability to receive and fulfill orders, we expect that the proceeds from the February 2023 Private Placement will allow us to further increase our production capacity. This will help us to generate and fulfill orders for our current product line and advance our new, innovative products in connection with recent collaboration arrangements with Nephron Pharmaceuticals. We are currently building inventory though our Distribution Agreement with Nephron and anticipate that we will commence receiving orders for and continue producing commercial quantities of our products in the second quarter of 2022.
 
We continue to be in discussions with healthcare companies and distributors for sales of our disposable syringe products. We intend to market these products to the US and foreign governments. In certain situations, we will also look to sell our disposable syringe products to hospitals and clinician offices as opportunities present themselves.
 
We expect that the Sharps Securegard product line will represent our initial disposable syringe platform to be commercially available to the market. The Securegard platform has an advanced set of features and benefits to support the needs of the market along with a high level of readiness for manufacturing and the ability to provide large commercial quantities for customers.
 
There have been delays in the commercialization of the Sharps Provensa product line. The Provensa product’s combination of specialized technology has created the need for further optimization related to the final assembly steps for the product. This was identified as we moved towards commercialization for the product line and the need to generate production quantities to support customer orders. This type of delay is typical with the development of new technology for the healthcare market to ensure the products are safe and effective for use every time. We are endeavoring to address all obstacles to advance the commercialization of the Provensa product line as soon as possible.
 
Our Products
 
DISPOSABLE SYRINGES:
 
Smart safety disposable syringes with Ultra-low waste space technology are the preferred syringe platform for the administration of many vaccines and injectable medications. Their design inherently reduces the amount of thrown way, wasted therapies and thus improves the supply of crucial and in-demand medicines. Both syringe lines carry less than 20 microliters of dead space, as compared to the 70 microliters “Low Dead Space” designation and the up 140 microliters dead space found in competitors’ syringes. In addition, both passive and active safety features are those most requested by clinicians in the field, in order to avoid infectious needlestick injuries, and reuse prevention features are a requirement by the World Health Organization.
 
The Sharps Securegard and Provensa safety syringe product lines have been designed to address the three primary administration concerns with syringe delivery systems:
 
1. Accidental needlestick injuries: these occur when the clinician is stuck with an infected needle. According to the WHO, these accidents likely take place in excess of 2 million times per year. When a clinician receives an infectious needlestick injury, any blood borne disease which the patient had, could be transmitted to them. A 2016 World Health Organization Commission reported that over 16 billion injections are delivered worldwide each year (pre-Covid era). A recent analysis showed that 55.1% of healthcare workers had sustained a needlestick injury, or NSI, at some point in their career. Over one million healthcare worker NSIs are documented each year in the US and Europe and over 3 million worldwide with the true incidence believed to be more than double those numbers as over half of injuries go unreported. US data on injury trends disturbingly show recent worsening despite safety campaigns and protocols. In a 2016 study, economic analysis has placed the average cost of an NSI at $747 (direct plus indirect costs) and strongly supported the use of safety-engineered devices for injection. Low compliance with recommended safety protocols can be seen upon examination of injury data where a majority of injuries continue to occur with non-safety devices or before full activation of a safety-protection feature.

2. Wasted medicine/dead space: all needle and syringes have space which permits the accumulation of injectable medications which cannot be accessed and are thrown away with each injection. Both Sharps Securegard and Provensa have less than 20 microliters of waste space - others have as much as 140 microliters of waste space. Without knowing what syringe is going to be used, pharmaceutical companies must overfill their vials to account for this loss. For difficult to manufacture injectable medications, this reduces the number of life saving doses which could be available to the public. When doses are extremely small, waste space can exceed the required dose. That means more medications are being thrown away than injected into the patient. When healthcare providers use ultra-low waste syringes with multi-dose vials it allows for the availability of up to 20% to 40% more medication for patients that need the treatment.
 
3. Reuse prevention: the reuse of a needle or syringe puts patients and populations in danger of contracting debilitating and deadly bloodborne diseases such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and possibly HIV. Both passive and active features are designed into Sharps syringes to eliminate this risk. Reuse prevention is recognized by the WHO as a required feature for its syringe distribution programs and the Securegard product line has been approved by the organization.
 
PREFILLABLE SYRINGES:
 
Sharps Technology is poised to expand its commercialized product portfolio through its collaboration with Nephron Pharmaceuticals. The Sharps-Nephron manufacturing and supply agreement is focused on the development and manufacture of high value pre-fillable syringe systems that are highly sought after by the healthcare industry and pharmaceutical markets, with projected product supply beginning the 4th quarter of 2023. Plans are already being developed by Sharps for further expansion of its current manufacturing capabilities to support the anticipated future industry and customer demand for pre-fillable syringe systems capable of incorporating passive safety, low waste, and reuse prevention features as applicable. The prefillable syringe lines will utilize highly automated equipment and controlled environments established in collaboration with Nephron. These premium offerings will be made from what the Company believes to be the highest quality raw materials, on the most innovative technology, and will be compliant with the USP standards required in the United States as well as the EP and JP international standards. The products provide an alternative high-quality solution to glass syringes by utilizing inert polymers such as Cyclic Olefin Polymer (COP) and Cyclic Olefin Copolymer (COC). These polymer syringes have many of the same characteristics as current pharmaceutical glass to support long term drug stability. The product pipeline includes 1mL short, 2.25mL, 5 mL, 10ml and 50ml volumetric sizes, silicone free systems and ophthalmic drug delivery for the ever-growing cosmetics market, dual chamber systems for lyophilized products, and custom container solutions for autoinjectors.
Competitive Environment
 
We anticipate our major domestic competitors will include Retractable Technologies, Inc., Becton Dickinson & Company, Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (“Medtronic,” formerly known as Covidien), Terumo Medical Corp., Smiths Medical, and B Braun. Our competitors may have greater financial resources, larger and more established sales, marketing, and distribution organizations; and greater market influence, including long-term and/or exclusive contracts.
 
We anticipate that we will compete primarily on the basis of healthcare worker and patient safety, product performance, and quality. We believe our competitive advantages will include the combination of passive safety and ultra low waste features.
 
Government Regulations 
 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale and distribution of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510k clearance, and premarket approval, also called PMA approval. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, known as the Quality System Regulations, or QSR. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Our Sharps Provensa has been cleared by the FDA under the 510k premarket notification process (Class II).
 
Outside of the United States, our ability to market our products will be contingent also upon our receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval or clearance has been obtained. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval or clearance process. The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and differ from those required for FDA approval or clearance.
 
The sale of medical products is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Intellectual property rights, particularly patent rights, are material to our business. We own three patents used in the Sharps Provensa, which expire between 2035 and 2040. Our issued patents include a design patent (USD743,025) for the ornamental design for a safety syringe, a patent (US 10,980,950) for an ultra low-waste needle and syringe system that automatically and passively renders a needle safe during the injection process, and a patent (US 11,154,663) for a pre-filled safety needle and syringe system.
 
We have three additional pending patent applications in the United States and one PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patent application. The patent applications, which we own, have an anticipated expiration date of June 22, 2040. The pending patent applications are for (i) an ultra-low waste disposable syringe with self-adjusting integrating safety features, (ii) an ultra-low waste disposable safety syringe for low dose injections, and (iii) a needle and syringe system with automatic safety shield that renders a needle safe. Our pending patent applications are for utility patents. With respect to the last of these patent applications, we have, in addition to our United States patent application, also filed a PCT patent application. A PCT application is a single utility patent filing that provides international patent-pending status. By itself, a PCT application will not lead to foreign patents. To obtain foreign patents for this PCT patent application, we will need to file individual patent applications at a later time.
 
We have certain trademarks for Sharps Provensa, Sharps Provensa Ultra-Low Waste and filed applications to register other trademarks for use in our Sharps Provensa product line.
 
Human Capital
 
We have fifty-eight full-time employees, one of which is our Chief Executive Officer, and retain the services of additional personnel on an independent contractor basis to support R&D, Finance, Marketing and Regulatory areas. We do not have any part-time employees. Of the fifty-eight employees, fifty-two work at our facilities in Hungary. We expect to add additional employees in order to increase production capacity.
