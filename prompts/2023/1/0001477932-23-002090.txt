Overview

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on August 22, 2016, as BioLabMart Inc. and changed our name to Qrons Inc. on August 8, 2017.

We are an innovative biotechnology company dedicated to developing biotech products, treatments and technologies that create a platform to combat neuronal diseases. Our approach is to marshal and leverage our proprietary research with developing breakthrough technologies in the fields of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”), molecular biology, stem cells and tissue engineering, for deployment in the fight against neuronal diseases. To accomplish this, we seek to engage in strategic arrangements with companies and institutions.  Our search is focused on researchers based in Israel, a country which is world-renowned for biotech innovations and where our researchers are based.

To date, the Company has collaborated with universities and scientists in the fields of regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and 3D printable hydrogels to develop a treatment that integrates proprietary, engineered mesenchymal stem cells (“MSCs”), 3D printable implant, smart materials and a novel delivery system. The Company has developed two product candidates for treating penetrating and non-penetrating (concussion-like) traumatic brain injuries (“TBIs”), both integrating proprietary, anti-brain inflammation synthetic hydrogel and modified MSCs. QS100TM is an injury specific, 3D printable, implantable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel, to treat penetrating brain injuries and QS200TM is an injectable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel for the treatment of diffused injuries commonly referred to as concussions.

In early 2022, the Company began collaborating with scientists at a leading University in Israel to conduct preliminary experiments to confirm that a combination of certain molecule compounds that they invented which contain immunomodulating properties when integrated with ingredients in our QS200™ product candidate may substantially improve its solubility and allow very high dosage treatments which we believe offers treatment options to diffused axonal injuries. These molecules are being tested for certain indication in various Phase II trials conducted by others. 
We also believe that the improved dosage delivery may present a unique treatment option to patients who suffer from antibiotic resistant bacteria infection and Sepsis. We are looking to conduct such in vitro tests, which if successful we believe may provide an expedited pathway to human trials.

Under an intellectual property license agreement (the “Intellectual Property Agreement”) with the Trustees of Dartmouth College (“Dartmouth”) to develop innovative 3D printable, biocompatible advanced materials, Dartmouth granted the Company an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license for 3D printable materials in the field of human and animal health and certain additional patent rights to use and commercialize licensed products and services.

The Company has relied primarily on its two co-founders, Jonah Meer, Chief Executive Officer, and Ido Merfeld, President, who are its sole directors, to manage its day-to-day business. The Company currently outsources professional services to third parties in an effort to maintain lower operational costs.

Messrs. Meer and Merfeld, as the holders of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A Preferred Stock, collectively have 66 2/3% of the voting rights of the Company. Acting together, they will be able to influence the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our stockholders.

The Company’s common stock has traded on the OTCQB Venture Market since August 12, 2019 under the symbol “QRON”.

Agreements with Dartmouth

On October 2, 2019, the Company entered into the Intellectual Property Agreement pursuant to which Dartmouth granted the Company an exclusive world-wide license under the patent application entitled “Mechanically Interlocked Molecules-based Materials for 3D Printing” in the field of human and animal health and certain additional patent rights to use and commercialize licensed products and services. The license grant includes the right of the Company to sublicense to third parties subject to the terms of the Agreement.

The Agreement provides for : (i) a $25,000 license issue fee; (ii) an annual license maintenance fee of $25,000, until the first commercial sale of a licensed product or service; (iii) an earned royalty of 2% of net sales of licensed products and services by the Company or a sublicensee; (iv) 15% of consideration received by the Company under a sublicense; and (v) beginning in the first calendar year after the first commercial sale, an annual minimum royalty payment of $500,000, $1,000,000 in the second calendar year, and $2,000,000 in the third calendar year and each year thereafter. The Company will also reimburse Dartmouth for all patent preparation, filing, maintenance and defense costs.

Under the Agreement, the Company must diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of licensed products and licensed services, including funding at least $1,000,000 of research in each calendar year beginning in 2019 and ending with the first commercial sale of a licensed product; filing an IND/BLA (or equivalent) with the FDA or a comparable European regulatory agency before the four-year anniversary and make the first commercial sale of a licensed product before the twelve-year anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement and achieve annual net sales of at least $50,000,000 by 2033. If the Company fails to perform any of these obligations, Dartmouth has the option to terminate the Agreement or change the exclusive license to a nonexclusive license.

Failure to timely make any payment due under the Agreement will result in interest charges to the Company of the lower of 10% per year or the maximum amount of interest allowable by applicable law.

The Agreement may be terminated by Dartmouth if the Company is in material breach of the Agreement which is not cured after 30 days of notice thereof or if the Company becomes insolvent. Dartmouth may terminate the Agreement if the Company challenges a Dartmouth patent or does not terminate a sublicensee that challenges a Dartmouth patent, except in response to a valid court or governmental order. The Company may terminate the Agreement at any time upon six months written notice to Dartmouth.

If the Company or any sublicensee or affiliate institutes or participates in a licensed patent challenge, the then current earned royalty rate for licensed products covered by Dartmouth patents will automatically be increased to three times the then current earned royalty rate.

The Company’s sponsored research agreement, pursuant to which the Company funded research conducted by Dartmouth of mutual interest to the parties terminated by its terms in July 2020.

Royalty and License Fee Sharing Agreement with Ariel

On November 30, 2019, the Company entered into a royalty and license fee sharing agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”) with Ariel Scientific Innovations Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ariel University, in Ariel, Israel (“Ariel”). which, among other things, supersedes and terminated the license and research funding agreement, dated December 14, 2016, as amended, between the Company and Ariel (the “License Agreement”). Upon the occurrence of an Exit Event, as such term is described in the Royalty Agreement, including an underwritten public offering of the Company’s shares with proceeds of at least $25 million, a consolidation, merger or reorganization of the Company, and a sale of all or substantially all of the shares and/or the assets of the Company, Ariel has the right to require the Company to issue up to 3% of the then issued and outstanding shares of its common stock. The issuance of any such shares in the future will result in dilution to the interests of other stockholders. In consideration for the parties’ agreement to terminate the License Agreement and for future general scientific collaboration between the parties, the Company agreed to pay Ariel a royalty of 1.25% of net sales (as defined in the Royalty Agreement) of products sold by the Company, or its affiliates and licensees for fifteen years from the first commercial sale in a particular country.

Services agreements which the Company had with Ariel related to laboratory access, molecular biology and neurobiology research and other services terminated at the end of April 2020. 

Business Description

The Company’s initial focus has been traumatic brain injury (“TBI”), a severe form of neuronal damage caused by powerful head impacts. Patients can experience transient symptoms, profound disability or death. TBI is generally caused by violent acts, motor vehicle accidents, falls and sports-related concussions.

TBI can be characterized into two distinct subtypes, penetrating injuries, in which an object pierces the skull and directly damages the brain causing extensive damage to the neuronal tissue, or diffused axonal injuries (commonly referred to as concussions) that are non-penetrating blows that push the brain against the skull, inflicting neuronal damage. Diffused axonal injuries account for approximately 89% of all TBIs. 

Neuronal cells interconnect to create the gigantic network that drives core brain functions. Unfortunately, neurons rarely regenerate after an injury. As a result, following a severe brain injury, neural connectivity is lost and brain function compromised.

TBI patients can become blind, deaf, paralyzed and experience cognitive and psychological issues. There is also evidence that TBI patients may be more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Repeated head injuries may induce brain pathologies associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (“CTE”) a neurodegenerative disease associated with multiple head injuries. CTE is often discovered in athletes, post-mortem.

There are no effective approved FDA treatments to help patients regain function of which we are aware. Current treatments focus on reducing secondary injuries. They can partially reduce further damage but do little or nothing to heal the brain. Most strategies are rehabilitative, helping patients adjust to their impaired cognitive state by creating workarounds, such as taking notes to compensate for lost short-term memory.

The Company developed two product candidates, QS100TM for treating penetrating brain injuries and QS200TM, for treating concussions and other diffused axonal injuries. Both QS100TM and QS200TM integrate proprietary, anti-brain inflammation synthetic hydrogel and modified MSCs and smart synthetic material. QS100TM is an injury specific, 3D printable, implantable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel to treat penetrating brain injuries (such as gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents and falls) and QS200TM is an injectable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel for the treatment of diffused axonal injuries.

QS100TM has demonstrated astrogliosis inhibition and induction of neuronal differentiation in our in-vivo animal experiment penetrating injury animal model. QS200TM research has shown efficacy for concussions and diffused brain injuries.

We believe that QS100TM’s advances provide a superior stem cells/synthetic hydrogel integration which will enable the unleashing of a precise, effective and controlled delivery of our proprietary MSCs so as to induce neuronal growth.

We further believe that QS200™ may substantially improve solubility of certain molecules that have been identified and allow very high dosage treatments which we believe offers treatment options to diffused axonal injuries. 

We also believe that the improved dosage delivery may present a unique treatment option to patients who suffer from antibiotic resistant bacteria infection and sepsis. Sepsis is a life threatening medical emergency that arises when the body’s response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. 

There remains no effective treatment for sepsis worldwide and high mortality rate persists. It is a leading cause of death in hospitals. It is also the main reason why people are readmitted to hospital. 

Although TBI and neuronal diseases occur in different regions and display different causes or origins, they share common cellular and molecular mechanisms. Building on the Company’s activities in its research activities for TBI’s and its activities and interactions in Israel, the Company has expanded its proprietary TBI research, to create a platform making use of synergic technologies to combat a broader range of additional neuronal diseases.

The nervous system is comprised of the brain, spinal cord and nerves. Together they control all of the workings of the body. When something goes awry with a part of the nervous system, one can experience difficulties with movement, speech, swallowing, breathing or learning. Problems may also develop that affect memory, senses or mood.

Four decades of intense research and development efforts have failed to yield effective interventions for neuronal diseases. The lack of success in the search for a drug or treatment to improve the devastating symptoms of chronic neuronal diseases has been one of modern medicine’s greatest frustrations. 

The lack of effective therapies for neuronal diseases creates an enormous social and economic burden on society.

Major types of neuronal diseases include:


· | Diseases caused by faulty genes, such as Huntington’s disease and muscular dystrophy nervous system development disorder, such as spina bifida;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Degenerative diseases, where nerve cells are damaged or die, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease; 
· | Diseases of the blood vessels supplying the brain, such as stroke; 
· | Injuries to the spinal cord and brain; 
· | Seizure disorders, such as epilepsy; 


Although these diseases occur in different regions and display different causes or origins, they share common cellular and molecular mechanisms.

Our Mission and Approach

Our goal is to develop and license biotech products, treatments and technologies through the creation of a platform to combat neuronal diseases. Our approach is to seek to marshal and leverage the remarkable advances made in the fields of AI, ML, molecular biology, stem cells and tissue engineering for deployment in the fight against neuronal diseases. We seek to accomplish this through development, acquisitions and investments.

We are seeking to engage in strategic and partner arrangements and provide assistance and support in furtherance of our development goals. We seek companies and institutions that are developing breakthrough technologies in line with our approach. Our search is focused on researchers based in Israel, a country which is world-renowned as having a long track record of successful and ground-breaking innovations.

We believe we have assembled a talented and experienced development team, comprised of scientists, doctors and finance professionals, who can identify and evaluate promising product and treatment candidates and partner companies for potential acquisition. The core of our team consists of seasoned Israelis making us well positioned to mine Israel’s up and coming start-ups and technologies.

Our search is for value accretive transactions with high growth, and clinical and commercial potential. Following the exclusive license or acquisition of the intellectual property underpinning a product candidate, we will seek to leverage our business, scientific, regulatory, legal and finance expertise to help young partner companies and entrepreneurs achieve their goals while providing us a platform to advance treatments of unmet neuronal diseases.

To date, we have two product candidates, QS100TM for treating penetrating brain injuries and QS200TM, for treating concussions and other diffused axonal injuries. Both QS100TM and QS200TM integrate proprietary, anti-brain inflammation synthetic hydrogel and modified MSCs and smart synthetic material. QS100TM is an injury specific, 3D printable, implantable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel to treat penetrating brain injuries (such as gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents and falls) and QS200TM is an injectable MSCs-synthetic hydrogel for the treatment of diffused injuries commonly referred to as concussions. 

 We have identified at least two other product candidates and subject to funding intend to initiate invitro testing.
We aim through future research and development collaborations to advance these and other product candidates. There can be no assurance that any collaborative research conducted will be successful in achieving its goals.

Our Market

There are various estimates of the size of the neurological disorder market as individual reports focus on particular segments or disorder, geographical area or treatment in the broad neurological disorder market. According to some reports, one in six people live with a neurological disease or disorder in the United States.

Continued growth of the global neurological disorder drugs market has been projected and can be attributed to the rise in prevalence of neurology diseases among the geriatric population across the globe and is expected to substantially increase as the population ages.

The market for TBI, which has been the Company’s focus to date, has been analyzed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), which sees TBI as a major cause of death and disability in the United States with TBI contributing about 30% of all injury deaths. According to the CDC, in 2020 there were over 64,000 deaths in the United States from injuries that include TBI, with people aged 75 years or older accounting for about 32% of TBI related hospitalizations and 28% of TBI related deaths .. Annually in the U.S. there are more than 2.5 million reported cases with 223,000 hospitalizations. CDC data indicates that the economic cost of TBI in 2010, including direct and indirect medical costs, is estimated to be approximately $76.5 billion. According to the European CENTER, the global annual burden of TBI was estimated at $400 billion.

The Sepsis Therapeutics market in the U.S. is estimated at $1.1 Billion in the year 2022. China, the worlds second largest economy, is forecast to reach a projected market size of $59.1 Billion by the year 2030 trailing a CAGR of 74.2% over the analysis period 2022 to 2030. Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at 70.3% and 67.1% respectively over the 2022-2030 period. Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 63% CAGR.

In the changed post COVID-19 business landscape, the global market for Sepsis Therapeutics estimated at $3.9 Billion in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of $433.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 80.4% over the period 2022-2030.

Factors, such as the high prevalence of sepsis, increasing awareness, and the introduction of technologically advanced diagnostic solutions are expected to significantly fuel the market growth over the forecast period. Recent studies have shown an increasing prevalence of this life-threatening disease around the globe.

Market Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

We believe that our approach of creating a platform to combat neuronal diseases making use of next generation treatments through our development team based in Israel can provide us with a competitive intellectual and cost advantage. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies. To the extent that we develop product candidates for indications with larger patient populations, we expect to experience particularly intense competition from larger and better funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Any product candidate that we may develop will compete with such larger and better funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, established drugs or solutions and new drug candidates being developed by others, that may currently be in clinical trials.

Currently there are no approved products for our two product candidates. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their effectiveness, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

In the search for treatments for additional neuronal diseases there are many product candidates in development. While competition may be intense there are many indications that still remain untreated and we will seek out those indications where we believe we can bring a therapeutics and/or cost advantage versus competitors.

Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we will strive to protect it, including by seeking, obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, novel discoveries and technology, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Our agreements also provide that all intellectual property created under such agreements belong to us.

Dartmouth granted the Company an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license for such 3D printable materials in the field of human and animal health and certain additional patent rights to use and commercialize licensed products and services pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement.

On April 9, 2018, the Company filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO entitled ‘Techniques for Promoting Neuronal Recovery” and on January 22, 2019, filed a second application that included further technological developments and data. In addition, on April 7, 2019, the Company filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application with the World Intellectual Property Organization to allow the Company to file patent applications and seek protection in most major market countries throughout the world. On September 23, 2020, the Company filed with the USPTO the US National Phase of its international PCT application thereby initiating its application for a United States Patent.

On April 3, 2022 the Company filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO entitled Therapeutic Polypseudorotaxane Hydrogels’. The patent relates generally to the treatment of pathological central nervous system conditions such as traumatic injury or neurodegenerative disease. More specifically some applications of the invention relate to uses of hydrogels in the treatment of such conditions. Further the Company has filed an International Patent Application at the International Bureau, for inventions of Therapeutic Polypseudorotaxane Hydrogels in order to provide the Company with the option to, in the future, seek protection for these inventions globally. This International Patent Application was filed on March 12, 2023, and was assigned application number PCT/IB2023/052368. 

Subject to sufficient resources the Company plans to file several additional patents relating to the integration of its QS200™ with certain molecules to treat sepsis and separately to treat diffused axonal injuries. 

On November 15, 2017, Dartmouth filed a utility patent application with the USPTO for “Mechanically Interlocked Molecules-Based Materials” for 3-D printing, which the Company financed by reimbursing Dartmouth for patent filing costs.

We cannot guarantee that our pending patent applications, or any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the scope of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not be able to maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates.

The Company’s strategy of creating a platform through development, acquisition and investment is to enable it to obtain access to patented intellectual property in a more streamlined and cost-effective fashion as the patent process will have either been already granted or be at a later stage in the application process.

Government Regulation

The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing, and distribution of drug products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. We are not permitted to market any biological drug product in the United States until we receive a Biologics License from the FDA. We have not previously submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the FDA, or similar approval filings to comparable foreign authorities. A BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, pure, and potent for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls for the product, and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre- license inspection. We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. The FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support licensure. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain licensure of the product candidates based on the completed clinical trials. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain, complex, expensive, and lengthy, and approval may not be obtained.

8


We will also be required to comply with costly and time-consuming compliance by foreign regulatory authorities if we want to sell our products outside of the United States.

Ethical, social and legal concerns about research regarding stem cells, could result in regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

FDA Review, Clearance and Approval Process

In the US, an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) or BLA is required for nearly all new drugs or biologics entering clinical trials. The IND or BLA comprises three sections: chemistry and manufacturing controls (“CMC”), clinical study design, and nonclinical studies. The nonclinical studies section mainly concerns safety and toxicity in animals using the clinically intended route of administration and a product very similar, if not identical, to that which will be used in the clinic. This section typically includes a description of efficacy studies in relevant disease models. The CMC section pertains to manufacturing processes and quality control systems for ensuring consistency and the absence of potentially deleterious agents in the final product. Each of the sections of the IND or BLA must provide reviewers with a sufficient amount of detail to determine the potential safety of any product before allowing evaluation in humans.

The regulatory route for licensure of an eventual product based on MSCs will likely require a BLA as opposed to a New Drug Application (“NDA”), the latter which generally pertains to drugs of well-defined composition. Within the FDA there are two centers responsible for oversight and approval of new drugs, The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). Jurisdictional oversight of biologics generally falls to CBER: with important exceptions for less complex entities, such as monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins. Therefore, the complexity of MSCs whether wholly or partially fractioned, likely will place it under the review of CBER.

Clinical Trials

The first step, a preclinical phase, is to find a promising agent, which involves taking advantage of the advances made in understanding a disease, pharmacology, computer science, and chemistry. Breaking down a disease process into its components can provide clues for targeting drug development. For example, if an enzyme is determined to be a key component of a disease process, a researcher might seek ways to inhibit this enzyme. Advances in basic science might help by ascertaining the active enzyme site. Numerous compounds might be synthesized and tested before a promising agent emerges. Computer modeling often helps select what compounds might be the most promising.

The next step before attempting a clinical trial in humans is to test the drug in living animals, usually rodents. The FDA requires that certain animal tests be conducted before humans are exposed to a new molecular entity. The objectives of early in vivo testing are to demonstrate the safety of the proposed medication. For example, tests should prove that the compound does not cause chromosomal damage and is not toxic at the doses that would most likely be effective. The results of these tests are used to support the IND or BLA application that is filed with the FDA. The IND application includes chemical and manufacturing data, animal test results, including pharmacology and safety data, the rationale for testing a new compound in humans, strategies for protection of human volunteers, and a plan for clinical testing. If the FDA is satisfied with the documentation, the stage is set for phase 1 clinical trials.

Phase 1 studies focus on the safety and pharmacology of a compound. During this stage low doses of a compound are administered to a small group of healthy volunteers who are closely supervised. In cases of severe or life-threatening illnesses, volunteers with the disease may be used. Generally, 20 to 100 volunteers are enrolled in a phase 1 trial. These studies usually start with very low doses, which are gradually increased. On average, about two thirds of phase 1 compounds will be found safe enough to progress to phase 2.


9


Phase 2 studies examine the effectiveness of a compound. To avoid unnecessarily exposing a human volunteer to a potentially harmful substance, studies are based on an analysis of the fewest volunteers needed to provide sufficient statistical power to determine efficacy. Typically, phase 2 studies involve 100 to 300 patients who suffer from the condition the new drug is intended to treat. During phase 2 studies, researchers seek to determine the effective dose, the method of delivery (e.g., oral or intravenous), and the dosing interval, as well as to reconfirm product safety. Patients in this stage are monitored carefully and assessed continuously. A substantial number of these drug trials are discontinued during phase 2 studies. Some drugs turn out to be ineffective, while others have safety problems or intolerable side effects.

Phase 3 trials are the final step before seeking FDA approval. During phase 3, researchers try to confirm previous findings in a larger population. These studies usually last from 2 to 10 years and involve thousands of patients across multiple sites. These studies are used to demonstrate further safety and effectiveness and to determine the best dosage. Despite the intense scrutiny a product receives before undergoing expensive and extensive phase 3 testing, approximately 10% of medications fail in phase 3 trials.

If a drug or biologic survives the clinical trials, an NDA or BLA is submitted to the FDA. An NDA or BLA contains all the preclinical and clinical information obtained during the testing phase. The application contains information on the chemical makeup and manufacturing process, pharmacology and toxicity of the compound, human pharmacokinetics, results of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling. An NDA can include experience with the product from outside the United States as well as external studies related to the drug.

After receiving an NDA or BLA, the FDA completes an independent review and makes its recommendations. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (“PDUFA”) was designed to help shorten the review time. This Act allowed the agency to collect user fees from pharmaceutical companies as financial support to enhance the review process. The 1992 act specifies that the FDA reviews a standard drug or biologic application within 12 months and a priority application within 6 months. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Application for drugs or biologics similar to those on the market are considered standard, whereas priority applications represent drugs or biologics offering important advances in addition to existing treatments. If during the review the FDA staff feels there is a need for additional information or corrections, they will make a written request to the applicant. During the review process it is not unusual for the FDA to interact with the applicant staff.

Once the review is complete, the NDA or BLA might be approved or rejected. If the drug or biologic is not approved, the applicant is given the reasons why and what information could be provided to make the application acceptable. Sometimes the FDA makes a tentative approval recommendation, requesting that a minor deficiency or labeling issue be corrected before final approval. Once a drug or biologic is approved, it can be marketed.

Some approvals contain conditions that must be met after initial marketing, such as conducting additional clinical studies. For example, the FDA might request a post-marketing, or phase 4, study to examine the risks and benefits of the new drug or biologic in a different population or to conduct special monitoring in a high-risk population. Alternatively, a phase 4 study might be initiated by the sponsor to assess such issues as the longer-term effects of exposure, to optimize the dose for marketing, to evaluate the effects in pediatric patients, or to examine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for additional indications. Post-marketing surveillance is important, because even the most well-designed phase 3 studies might not uncover every problem that could become apparent once a product is widely used. Furthermore, the new product might be more widely used by groups that might not have been well studied in the clinical trials, such as elderly patients. A crucial element in this process is that physicians report any untoward complications. The FDA has set up a medical reporting program called Medwatch to track serious adverse events. The manufacturer must report adverse reactions at quarterly intervals for the first 3 years after approval including a special report for any serious and unexpected adverse reactions.
