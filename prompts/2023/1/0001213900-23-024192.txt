General 



Applied Energetics, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our headquarters are located at 9070 S. Rita Road, Suite 1500, Tucson, Arizona, 85747 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415. Our website is located at www.appliedenergetics.com.



Applied Energetics, Inc. specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers, advanced optical systems, high voltage electronics, and integrated guided energy systems for prospective defense, national security, industrial, biomedical, and scientific customers worldwide.



Technology, Capabilities, and Patents 



Applied Energetics, Inc. is recognized as a global leader in developing the next generation optical sources exhibiting ever-increasing output energy, peak power and frequency agility while also providing decreased size, weight, and cost of these systems for customers. Applied Energetics utilizes patented, dual-use technologies to advance critical industries. Leveraging our proprietary fiber-based architecture and wavelength- and pulse-agility capability, our Ultrashort Pulse (“USP™”) technology can enable users to achieve specific effects across different use cases with an unmatched blend of size, weight and power attributes. While initially designed to meet the emerging needs and priorities for the national security community, our directed energy technology also has commercial applications in both the biomedical and advanced manufacturing industries.

The Applied Energetics scientific team is continuously innovating and expanding our patent portfolio to cover these technological breakthroughs and further enhance our suite of solutions for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and for commercial, biomedical and space applications with optical sources operating from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.



Applied Energetics has developed, successfully demonstrated and holds all crucial intellectual property rights to a dynamic directed energy technology called Laser Guided Energy (“LGE®”) and Laser Induced Plasma Channel (“LIPC ®”). LGE and LIPC are technologies that can be used in a new generation of high-tech directed energy systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) previously recognized only two key types of Directed Energy Weapon (“DEW”) technologies, High Energy Lasers (“HEL”), and High-Power Microwave (“HPM”). Neither the HEL nor the HPM intellectual property portfolio is owned by a single entity. The DOD then designated a third DEW technology, LGE. Applied Energetics’ LGE and LIPC technologies are wholly owned by Applied Energetics and protected by one or more of Applied Energetics’ 27 issued patents and 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). These GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government, providing the company with greatly extended protection rights. The company also has seven pending patent applications and one provisional patent application which is undergoing conversion to its non-provisional form. We continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate to protect our intellectual property and enhance our competitive advantage.



Applied Energetics’ Directed Energy technologies are vastly different from conventional directed energy systems, i.e. HEL, and HPM. LGE uses Ultrashort Pulse (USP™) laser technology to combine the speed and precision of lasers with the overwhelming impact on targeted threats with high-voltage electricity. A key element of LGE is its novel ability to offer selectable and tunable properties that can help protect non-combatants and combat zone infrastructure. Applied Energetics’ proprietary fiber-based architecture is a key differentiator for our most recent technology demonstrators. Compared with traditional continuous wave laser technologies with their larger footprints, AE’s architecture enables orders of magnitude size-weight-power reductions on all deliverables, creating powerful, dual-use and agile systems that can fit a host of platforms while delivering very high-intensity, ultrashort pulses of light to the required target. This unique directed energy solution allows extremely high peak power and energy, with target and effects tunability, and is effective against a wide variety of potential targets.



Applied Energetics’ unique optical fiber-based laser architectures enable unmatched wavelength agility as well as pulse duration agility. Using innovative and highly specialized frequency shifting techniques, wavelengths can be custom tuned from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared. In addition, temporal outputs can be adjusted from continuous wave to sub-picoseconds. The technology enables the customer to adjust the lasers’ operating parameters, ultimately creating more flexibility to change wavelength and pulse width. This feature allows for optimization of laser performance for defense or commercial applications.



Our proprietary USP laser technology provides a significantly more compact solution than current continuous wave laser platforms while still delivering high peak power. Continuous wave laser systems are typically used to heat a target and, during continuous illumination, this heat transfer leads to melting or charring of the material. Using continuous wave output powers that now exceed 100 kilowatts (1kW = 1000 watts), it can take anywhere from seconds to minutes to impact a target. By contrast, Applied Energetics has delivered USP lasers to national security users that exceed five terawatts (1 TW = 1 trillion watts) in peak power, with the difference being that this peak power from a USP laser is delivered in a pulse that is less than a trillionth of a second. During this short pulse duration, and having such a high peak intensity, near-instantaneous ablation of the surface of the threat takes place. The net results of our innovative USP approaches are highly effective lasers with mountable footprints that require only a fraction of the size and weight of other directed energy technologies.



As Applied Energetics looks toward the future, our corporate strategic roadmap builds upon the significant value of the company’s USP laser capabilities and key intellectual property, including LGE and LIPC, to offer our prospective partners, co-developers and system integrators a variety of next-generation ultrashort pulse and frequency-agile optical sources, from the ultraviolet to the far infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, to address numerous challenges within the national security, biomedical, and advanced manufacturing market sectors.



Recent Developments 



In May 2022, Applied Energetics was awarded a $3.89 million, two-year grant from the Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research (ONR), to develop an optical system capable of defeating customer-specified threats for integration onto U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) platforms. We were awarded this grant to accelerate the development and testing of Infrared (IR) optical technology with an ultrashort pulse laser (USPL) system. The overall objective is to advance and ruggedize optical technologies that can be fielded on a variety of USMC platforms and are able to operate in harsh conditions.

We also executed a Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) contract with the U.S. Army on June 2, 2022. The objective of the contract is the delivery of an ultra-broadband infrared (IR) source. Under this contract, Applied Energetics, was to model novel approaches for the eye-safe delivery of ultra-broadband infrared laser pulses to electro-optic sensors. Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors are imaging systems used for military applications. The STTR program is a federally funded initiative to incorporate small business technological innovation into government supported research and development programs. STTRs require the small business to team with a university or non-profit and are structured in three potential phases. Applied Energetics proposed to partner with the James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona for Phase I. The company completed work on this first phase of the Army STTR and filed the report on January 3, 2023. Prior to the final report filing, AE submitted the Phase II proposal by the submission deadline of December 7, 2022. The Phase II proposals can be up to $1.15 M in contract funding over a 24-month period. Any announcement on the Phase II STTR proposals is estimated by the Army to be released no later than Q2 of 2023.



Effective August 1, 2022, our board of directors appointed Christopher Donaghey, age 50, to serve as Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer. The company and Mr. Donaghey entered into an Executive Employment Agreement, pursuant to which he is serving for an initial term of four years, with automatic renewal for additional one-year periods thereafter unless either party terminates the agreement. The agreement calls for salary of $350,000 per year, plus standard benefits and eligibility for a bonus at the discretion of the board. The company has also granted Mr. Donaghey additional options to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock under its 2018 Incentive Stock Plan, which vest over four years and have an exercise price of $2.36 per share, and Restricted Stock Units representing up to 400,000 shares of the company’s common stock which also vest over four years. The Restricted Stock Units are issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2022. Mr. Donaghey forfeited unvested options to purchase up to 950,000 shares of common stock which he had previously received for service on the company’s Board of Advisors.

Upon the successful examination, and with no opposition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) officially entered the marks LGE® (Reg. No. 6,289,892) and LIPC ® (Reg. No. 6,316,069) on March 9, 2021, and April 6, 2021, respectively, in the principal register. Applied Energetics has applications pending before the USPTO for the marks USP TM, USPL TM, AERG TM and AE TM and anticipates allowance and/or registration within the next six months. The company also has seven pending patent applications and one provisional patent application which is undergoing conversion to its non-provisional form. We continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate to protect our intellectual property and enhance our competitive advantage.



In April 2022, we repaid the remaining balance on the Paycheck Protection Program loan, which we took out in 2020. The original loan was in the amount of $132,760, but our compliance with the guidelines set forth by the Small Business Administration regarding use of the proceeds of the loan qualified us for a waiver of a portion of this amount. We had been repaying the remaining balance in monthly installments at an annual interest rate of 1%.



Ongoing Business Development Activities



Over the past few years, we have submitted multiple proposals to, and attended briefings with, various defense and other government agencies who have expressed an interest in our technology and applications. Due to the closures of multiple agencies and work-from-home orders during the Covid-19 pandemic, reviews and funding decisions on these proposals were delayed longer than anticipated as resources were focused on other matters within the government. Since the reopening of proposal reviews and processing, our team has been invited to, and completed, multiple briefings focused on our capabilities and submissions. We intend to continue developing and submitting proposals and to be available to attend on-site briefings to the extent possible. However, this positive action by the agencies could be reversed as Covid remains an ongoing risk. Any changes to reinstate the closures or work-from-home orders could again hamper the ability of the AE team to schedule on-site briefings for our proposals undergoing review.



Two significant pieces of legislation impacted Applied Energetics that were signed by the President on September 30, 2022. The first piece, bill S. 4900, the “SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022,” authorizes the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and six related pilot programs through Fiscal Year 2025; requires agencies with an SBIR or STTR program to establish a due diligence program to assess the potential risk posed by program applicants’ foreign ties; requires certain departments and agencies to report on national security risks within their SBIR/STTR programs; and establishes increased minimum performance standards for firms that have won a certain number of awards during a specified period of time.



The other piece of legislation that we have seen multiple times in the past decade is the Continuing Resolution (CR), HR 6833, which was amended three times to provide fiscal year 2023 appropriations to federal agencies through December 30, 2022, for continuing projects and activities of the federal government and includes supplemental appropriations to respond to the Russian military action in Ukraine. This CR provided for a continuation of funding for currently funded programs through December 30, but no new contracts until the 2023 fiscal year appropriations was approved by Congress. This CR allowed for current Applied Energetics programs to continue. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 was passed by the US House of Representatives and the US Senate and signed by President Biden on December 29, 2022. A similar situation occurred in the prior year as the US government final fiscal year 2022 appropriations bill was signed into law by President Biden on the night of March 11, 2022 and included increases in areas of particular interest to the company.



Strategic Plan and Analysis



The core of our strategy has been to continue growing our management and science teams with highly qualified individuals. This has driven our recruitment efforts in the areas of R&D, science, modeling and simulation, marketing and finance. We are also contemplating adding members to our Board of Directors and our Board of Advisors. Our board and leadership team have worked to align key innovations with our roadmap to encourage and enable internal filing for a broad, strategic and robust intellectual property portfolio and continue surveying the literature for acquisitions of parallel intellectual property to that end. We also intend to pursue strategic corporate acquisitions in related fields and technology. The company’s management continues to explore any favorable equity financing opportunities.

Our goal with the Applied Energetics Strategic Plan is to increase the energy, peak power and frequency agility of USP optical sources while decreasing the size, weight, and cost of these systems. We are in the process of developing this breadth of very high peak power USP lasers and additional optical sources that have a very broad range of applicability for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, commercial, and biomedical applications, such as biophotonic illumination and imaging. Although the historical market for Applied Energetics’ LGE and USP technology is the U.S. Government, the USP technologies are expected to provide numerous platforms for commercial additive and subtractive manufacturing and biomedical and imaging markets, creating a substantially larger market for our products to address. Since 2020, the Applied Energetics team was able to develop partnership and teaming arrangements with the three leading laser and optics institutes in the United States, namely, the University of Arizona, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Our desire is to work on programs jointly where the strengths of each organization can assist in escalating knowledge and delivery of systems to the government sponsors, and to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the directed energy fields.



Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we have continued to execute our business development plans, further our research and development program and submit filings for intellectual property and proposals for grants and contracts. During the past three years, we continued to submit proposals and have been engaged in meetings on a continuous basis with various agencies and departments both remotely and in person in Washington, DC and at various other government facilities. Having received a significant research grant and an STTR contract during the second quarter of 2022, we believe the interest in our technology and applications remains high, and we continue to submit proposals for all appropriate opportunities and share our vision of the disruptive capabilities of USP optical sources for both near- and far-term threats and dual-use commercial applications.



Through our analysis of the market, and in discussions with potential customers, we remain convinced that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in directed energy technologies. According to the US Department of Defense fiscal budgets from 2017 through 2023, its directed energy spending grew from approximately $500 million in 2017 to over $1.695 billion in 2023, an increase of nearly 240%. Market analysis and projections have estimated that this directed energy sector is anticipated to exceed $10.1 billion globally by 2026. We continue to be optimistic about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications, especially since this growth to nearly $1.7 B annually is being accomplished without a recognized Program of Record (POR) for directed energy platforms. Once these technologies are funded in production for a POR, these DOD budgets for DE will grow exponentially larger to support the technology insertion. The Applied Energetics team anticipates a continuation of strong funding for the directed energy community. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies, we believe we have the substantial building blocks needed to become a significant and successful developer in our USP and LGE marketplaces.



Market for Our Technology



Directed Energy Systems



Directed energy systems involve the use of directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, and assets. Previous to LGE, the only two viable directed energy systems were High Energy Laser (HEL), which uses heat to burn targets and High Power Microwave (HPM) systems, that use electromagnetic energy at specific microwave and radio frequencies to disable electronic systems.



HEL and HPM directed energy technologies have been under development for decades with numerous DoD and other government contractors participating. The unique attributes of directed energy weapon systems —the ability to create precise effects against multiple targets near-instantaneously and at a very low cost per shot—have great potential to help the DoD in addressing future warfare requirements. The DoD invests research and development dollars into directed energy solutions to fill gaps identified by warfighters. For example, in future conflicts with capable enemies possessing large inventories of guided missiles, it may be operationally risky and cost-prohibitive for the U.S. military to continue to rely exclusively on a limited number of kinetic missile interceptors. Such a “missile competition” could allow an adversary to impose costs on U.S. forces by compelling them to intercept each incoming missile with far more expensive kinetic munitions. The DoD has made technological advances in both performance and maturity as a result of many years of research with multiple threat-intercept technologies and has been directed by Congress, in fiscal year 2022 and, again, in fiscal 2023, to increase funding and evaluation of pulsed laser technology in future directed energy platforms.

Leveraging our proprietary fiber-based architecture and wavelength- and pulse-agility capability, our ultrashort pulse technology enables users to achieve specific effects across different use cases, with an unmatched blend of size, weight and power attributes. While initially designed to meet the emerging needs and priorities for the national security community, Applied Energetics’ directed energy technology also has commercial applications in both the biomedical and advanced manufacturing industries.



Fiber-Based Laser Architecture



Applied Energetics’ proprietary fiber-based architecture is a key differentiator for our technology. Compared with traditional continuous wave technology with larger footprints, AE’s architecture enables orders of magnitude size-weight-power reductions on all deliverables, creating powerful, dual-use and agile systems that can fit a host of platforms while delivering very high intensity, ultrashort pulses of light to the required target. Using this unique architecture as a laser source for an integrated system can enable Applied Energetics to develop, integrate and deliver a suite of technologies that best meet the needs and requirements of its customers.



Wavelength- and Pulse-Agility 



Applied Energetics’ optical fiber-based laser architectures enable unmatched wavelength agility as well as pulse duration agility. Using innovative and highly specialized frequency shifting techniques, wavelengths can be custom tuned from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared. In addition, temporal outputs can be adjusted from continuous wave to sub-picoseconds. The technology enables the customer to adjust the lasers’ operating parameters, ultimately creating more flexibility to change wavelength and pulse width. This feature allows for optimization of laser performance for defense or commercial applications.



Competition



AE’s Ultrashort Pulse sources, including proprietary LIPC ® based LGE® technology, are unique and can be integrated onto platforms being developed for use by the U.S. Government. Over the past several years, a relatively small number of major defense contractors have received significant funding for directed energy systems development, manufacturing and integration, using continuous wave high energy laser and microwave technologies. These contractors specialize in different directed energy system platforms to respond to a variety of threats. Applied Energetics believes that its pulsed laser systems can be a part of a layered defense solution alongside these other technologies. Although AE competes against other directed energy systems for funding, the uniqueness of our technologies should continue to support their development into weapon platform programs. AE believes that there is renewed U.S. Government interest in directed energy applications and believes that continued development of its USP capabilities and growing interest from all branches of the U.S. armed forces and other government agencies will lead to increases in government spending on directed energy in the coming years. Likewise, there are multiple new threats that must be addressed with unique and emerging technologies, and AE is working diligently to rapidly advance development, demonstration, testing and engineering of the Advanced Ultrashort Pulse lasers throughout the spectrum from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. We believe that USP technologies can rapidly accelerate in magnitude, as a percentage of the federal budget, compared with other technologies over the next several years.



AE’s primary direct USP optical source competition are corporations and contractors supported by foreign governments who may be attempting to develop similar technologies. AE believes that such foreign activity will create additional U.S. Government funding for both USP sources and LGE in order to maintain our country’s lead in pulsed directed-energy systems. Other companies with directed energy capabilities, albeit in continuous wave, microwave and other areas within directed energy, are Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, BAE, nLight, General Atomics, DRS Daylight Solutions and L3Harris Technologies.



Some of AE’s biggest commercial competitors are Trumpf (German), Coherent (US), Thales (France) and IPG (US), all of which are billion-dollar market class companies that have substantially more resources than AE.



Employees



As of March 29, 2023, we had fourteen employees, and we retain another six full- and part-time consultants.

Supplies and Raw Materials



We depend upon the availability of materials and major electro-optical components and the performance of our suppliers. Some of our products require relatively scarce fabricated materials. We generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring these necessary materials, components and other supplies for our products. However, the global supply chain continues to struggle toward normalcy following the Covid-19 pandemic. Our inability to procure the necessary optical and fabricated materials, components, electronics and other supplies for our products could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, a significant prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact the cost of materials and components. We continuously monitor potential supply chain issues and work with our suppliers to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary materials, components and other supplies, and reduce costs, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on global supply chain. We also monitor supplier liquidity and work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchases, entering long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and competition among suppliers, and the opportunity to develop and deliver scarce components that have few contracts or suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, but we are developing multiple sources to mitigate the risk. In some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize.
Regulatory Matters



Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We market our technology to numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business.



The U.S. government currently represents all of our current revenues and likely a substantial portion of any projected revenues for the foreseeable future. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers.



U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government. Defense contracts are additionally subject to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Other applicable laws and regulations apply as well. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholding on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines and could lead to cause-based suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
