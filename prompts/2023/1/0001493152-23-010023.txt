Summary
 
Sunstock, Inc. (“Sunstock” or “the Company”) was incorporated on July 23, 2012, as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation, under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. In July 2013, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Sandgate Acquisition Corporation to Sunstock, Inc. On July 18, 2013, Jason Chang and Dr. Ramnik S Clair were named as directors of the Company.
 
On October 22, 2018, Sunstock, Inc. acquired all assets and liabilities of Mom’s Silver Shop, Inc. (the “Retail Store”) located in Sacramento, California.
 
The Company’s business plan includes the buying, selling and distribution of precious metals, primarily gold. The Company pursues a “ground to coin” strategy, whereby it seeks to acquire mining assets as well as rights to purchase mining production and to sell these metals primarily through retail channels including their own branded coins. The Company emphasizes investment in enduring assets that we believe may provide ‘resource to retail’ conversion upside. Our goal is to provide our shareholders with an exceptional opportunity to capture value in the precious metals sector without incurring many of the costs and risks associated with actual mining operations.

The Business: Precious Metals and Coins - Sunstock
 
Silver and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion bars. In some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks. Another means of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99% pure Canadian Silver Maple Leaf and the one ounce 99.93% pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and precious metals is through exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges.
 
Investors typically look to precious metals as a safe and reliable store of value and as a way to protect their assets from the influence of inflation, devaluation, and potential bond and equity market crashes. They act as safe haven investments, particularly in times of elevated political and economic uncertainty. The flow of investment capital into commodity-related sectors has increased more than tenfold over the past decade. Stable precious metal prices compared to increasing stock market volatility have elevated investments in precious metals to a standalone asset class, forming part of almost all diversified asset portfolios.
 
At the present time, the Company does not anticipate or foresee a material effect on this line of its business from existing or probable governmental regulations except as follows. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many governments around the world enacting various social distancing orders and directives, which have resulted in decreased foot traffic to many businesses, as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary measures that have been viewed as inflationary by some markets, which has resulted in increased demand for physical precious metals bullion and coins. This recent increased demand has occurred at the same time in supply constraints from mints and refiners as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, premiums on precious metal bullion and coins available for immediate delivery have recently increased, affecting both our revenues and our ability to resupply our inventories of our precious metals. We expect price, demand and supply volatility to continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions governments are taking to address it.
 
Services and Products
 
The Company has established positions in precious metals. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held 27,317 ounces of silver and 80 ounces of gold.
 
Competition
 
The Company’s Retail Store has a number of small coin shop competitors in the Sacramento, California area, as well as online precious metals dealer competitors such as monex.com and apmex.com.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
The Company’s goal is to achieve vertical integration within the precious metal industry. To achieve this goal, the Company is investigating the acquisition of mineral rights and assets to complement its already established precious metal business. We intend to first focus on projects that already own significant amounts of unrefined – but already mined – gold ore and other precious metals.
