ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
BUSINESS
Jaguar Health, Inc. (“Jaguar” or the “Company”) is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based, sustainably derived prescription medicines for people and animals with gastrointestinal (“GI”) distress, including chronic, debilitating diarrhea. Jaguar Health's wholly owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Napo”), focuses on developing and commercializing proprietary plant-based human pharmaceuticals from plants harvested responsibly from rainforest areas. Our crofelemer drug product candidate is the subject of the OnTarget study, an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients receiving targeted therapy. As announced, patient enrollment in OnTarget reached approximately 75% in February 2023, and target trial enrollment of 256 patients is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2023. Jaguar is the majority shareholder of Napo Therapeutics S.p.A. (“Napo Therapeutics”), an Italian corporation established by Jaguar in Milan, Italy in 2021 that focuses on expanding crofelemer access in Europe. Napo Therapeutics’ core mission is to provide access to crofelemer in Europe to address significant rare/orphan disease

indications, including, initially, two key rare disease target indications: Short bowel syndrome (“SBS”) with intestinal failure and congenital diarrheal disorders (“CDD”). Jaguar Animal Health is a tradename of Jaguar Health.
Napo’s marketed drug Mytesi (crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets) is a first-in-class oral botanical drug product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. To date, this is the only oral plant-based botanical prescription medicine approved under the FDA’s Botanical Guidance. The Company’s Canalevia-CA1 (crofelemer delayed-release tablets) drug is the first and only oral plant-based prescription product that is FDA conditionally approved to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (“CID”) in dogs.
Crofelemer was granted orphan drug designation (“ODD”) by the FDA in August 2017 and by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in December 2021. Crofelemer was granted ODD by the FDA in February 2023 for microvillus inclusion disease (“MVID”), a rare CDD condition, and granted ODD for MVID by the EMA in October 2022. The Company is currently supporting investigator-initiated proof-of-concept (“POC”) studies of crofelemer in patients with SBS with intestinal failure or CDD, focused on obtaining POC of reduction of requirements of parenteral support including parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluids, throughout 2023. In accordance with the guidelines of specific European Union countries, publications of POC data from these trials could support early patient access to crofelemer for SBS with intestinal failure or CDD through programs in Europe. Early access programs are revenue generating, and reimbursable for participating patients.
Napo Therapeutics is initiating efforts to commence clinical development of crofelemer in SBS patients in support of the Company’s key focus on leveraging the EMA’s accelerated conditional marketing authorization pathway in Europe for these rare diseases. SBS affects approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people in the U.S., according to the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, and it is estimated that the population of SBS patients in Europe is approximately the same size. Despite limited treatment options, the global SBS market exceeded $568 million in 2019 and is expected to reach $4.6 billion by 2027, according to a report by Vision Research Reports.
CDD is considered an ultra-rare disease, with likely a couple of hundred patients diagnosed globally. In February 2022, Napo announced the completion of an investigator-initiated preclinical enterocyte (intestinal cell) in vitro study to evaluate the effects of crofelemer on cells with certain genetic defects that result in specific forms of CDD. The data from this study is expected to support the rare disease business model that Napo Therapeutics is pursuing in Europe under its exclusive license for crofelemer from Jaguar and Napo. CDD patients have intestinal failure and morbidity resulting in a failure to thrive due to malabsorption of nutrients and need parenteral nutrition. We believe the novel mechanism of action of crofelemer may have considerable potential to manage the severe secretory loss of electrolytes and fluid resulting in dehydration. There are currently no therapies for CDD except parenteral nutrition. Thus, crofelemer may reduce the associated morbidity and mortality of CDD and lessen the need for parenteral nutrition (“PN”).
Most of the activities of the Company are focused on the development and/or commercialization of Mytesi, including the ongoing clinical development of crofelemer for the prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult patients receiving targeted cancer therapy. Napo’s pivotal OnTarget Phase 3 clinical trial of crofelemer for prophylaxis of cancer therapy-related diarrhea (“CTD”) was initiated in October 2020 and is expected to complete enrolment in 2nd quarter of 2023. We also support the prioritized clinical program at Napo Therapeutics centered around the POC investigator-initiated trials of Crofelemer for SBS and CDD. In the field of animal health, we are continuing limited activities related to developing and commercializing first-in-class gastrointestinal products for dogs, dairy calves and foals.
Crofelemer is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory antidiarrheal drug which has a normalizing effect on electrolyte and fluid balance in the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders that cause gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including for the lead Phase 3 program in CTD, investigating prophylaxis of diarrhea related to targeted therapy with or without standard chemotherapy. Crofelemer delayed-release tablets are also being evaluated in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS-D”) and idiopathic/functional diarrhea in investigator-initiated trials.

Crofelemer powder for oral solution is being developed to support orphan or rare disease indications for infants and/or children with SBS and/or CDD, such as MVID.
In addition, a second-generation proprietary anti-secretory antidiarrheal drug (“NP-300”) is in development for symptomatic relief and treatment of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, with or without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, from bacterial, viral and parasitic infections including Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. This program is being pursued with the targeted incentive from the FDA of tropical disease priority review voucher.
In January 2023, Jaguar and Filament Health (“Filament”), with Funding from One Small Planet, formed the U.S.-based joint venture Magdalena Biosciences, Inc. (“Magdalena”). Magdalena’s focus is on the development of novel, natural prescription medicines derived from plants for mental health indications including, initially, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) in adults. The goal of the collaboration is to extend the botanical drug development capabilities of Jaguar and Filament in order to develop pharmaceutical-grade, standardized drug candidates for mental health disorders, and to partner with a potential future licensee to develop and commercialize these novel plant-based drugs. This new venture aligns with Jaguar's mental health Entheogen Therapeutics Initiative (“ETI”) and Filament's corporate mission to develop novel, natural prescription medicines from plants. Magdalena will leverage Jaguar's proprietary medicinal plant library and Filament's proprietary drug development technology. Jaguar’s library of 2,300 highly characterized medicinal plants and 3,500 plant extracts, all from firsthand ethnobotanical investigation by Jaguar and members of the ETI Scientific Strategy Team, is a key asset we have generated over 30 years that bridges the knowledge of traditional healers and Western medicine. Magdalena holds an exclusive license to plants and plant extracts in Jaguar's library, not including any sources of crofelemer or NP-300, for specific indications and is in the process of identifying plant candidates in the library that may prove beneficial for addressing indications such as ADHD.
In December 2021 we received conditional approval from the FDA to market Canalevia-CA1 (crofelemer delayed-release tablets), our oral plant-based prescription drug and the only available veterinary drug for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (“CID”) in dogs, and Canalevia-CA1 is now available to multiple leading veterinary distributors in the U.S. Canalevia-CA1 is a tablet that is given orally and can be prescribed for home treatment of CID. Canalevia-CA1 is conditionally approved by the FDA under application number 141-552. Conditional approval allows for commercialization of the product while Jaguar Animal Health continues to collect the substantial evidence of effectiveness required for full approval. We have received Minor Use in a Major Species (“MUMS”) designation from the FDA for Canalevia-CA1 to treat CID in dogs. FDA has established a "small number" threshold for minor use in each of the seven major species covered by the MUMS act. The small number threshold is currently 80,000 for dogs, representing the largest number of dogs that can be affected by a disease or condition over the course of a year and still have the use qualify as a minor use. 
We believe Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value adding benefits—an expanded pipeline of potential blockbuster human follow-on indications of crofelemer, and a second-generation anti-secretory agent—upon which to build global partnerships. Jaguar, through Napo, holds global unencumbered rights for crofelemer, Mytesi, and Canalevia-CA1. Additionally, several of the drug product opportunities in Jaguar’s crofelemer pipeline are backed by Phase 2 and proof of concept evidence from human clinical trials.
Napo has a direct sales force of 8 sales representatives and a national sales director covering U.S. geographies with the highest commercial potential. 
A key component of our marketing strategies for Mytesi in 2022 was our focus on the transition of Mytesi distribution to a closed network of specialty pharmacies rather than to wholesalers that resell the product to retail pharmacies. This transition was intended to help remove access barriers for patients receiving Mytesi and includes services such as a higher level of support for prior authorizations, appeals, adherence counseling, and home delivery options. While patients often visit retail pharmacies for short-term or uncomplicated medical needs, specialty pharmacies focus on serving patients with complex and chronic medical conditions like HIV. The transition to a closed network of specialty pharmacies resulted in a meaningful reduction in Mytesi distribution costs and helps prepare our U.S. commercial distribution network for future indication expansion of crofelemer to other populations of patients with complex medical needs, such as CTD.

With the introduction of newer antiretroviral (“ARV”) drug therapies, there has been a reduction in the severity of ARV induced diarrhea. However, a significant portion of this patient population still suffers from diarrhea caused by HIV enteropathy, which is due to the direct and indirect effects of HIV on the intestinal mucosa. Chronic diarrhea remains a significant complaint of PLWHA, particularly those who are older and have lived with the virus in their gut for more than 10 years. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, currently more than 70% of people living with HIV are over age 50 and have lived with HIV for more than 10 years.
Napo expanded the NapoCares Patient Support Program for Mytesi in April 2020 as part of the Company's enhanced market access strategy. The expansion meaningfully increased co-pay support for commercially insured patients, which also includes allowing the co-pay amount to remain the same whether a patient fills a 30-day or a 90-day prescription of Mytesi. The expansion also increased the income ceiling from two times the Federal poverty limit to five times the Federal poverty limit for our patient assistance program, which will allow more low-income patients to receive Mytesi at no cost. The co-pay program and patient assistance program are components of a comprehensive suite of patient support services Napo rolled out in the second quarter of 2020 with the support of AssistRx, a specialty therapy initiation and patient support company.
Napo has actively ensured that its intellectual property (“IP”) filings in support of the development of crofelemer for various proposed indications are protected appropriately. The IP portfolio for crofelemer includes the relief and treatment of HIV-associated diarrhea and CID as well as planned indications for inflammatory diarrhea, IBS-D, CDD and SBS, with all indications, Napo prioritizes IP protection. Napo currently holds approximately 145 patents, the majority of which do not expire until 2027-2031, and approximately 53 patents pending.

In October 2020, Napo initiated its pivotal OnTarget Phase 3 clinical trial of crofelemer for prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients receiving targeted therapy with or without chemotherapy. As announced, patient enrollment in OnTarget reached approximately 75% in February 2023, and target trial enrollment of 256 patients is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2023. The Company’s efforts over the past year were focused on expanding the trial to new U.S. and international sites – with trial sites now active in Georgia, the Republic of Serbia, Argentina, and Taiwan—which has significantly accelerated enrollment. The OnTarget trial is evaluating crofelemer's effectiveness in prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult solid tumor patients that receive targeted therapies with or without standard chemotherapy. Such prophylaxis would potentially impact the patient's ability to remain on their cancer therapy regimens at approved doses for better cancer treatment outcomes, with less required medical intervention and cost.
The OnTarget clinical trial is a 24-week (two 12-week stages), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crofelemer in the prophylaxis of diarrhea in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving targeted cancer therapy-containing treatment regimens. Patients are randomized to receive either crofelemer or matching placebo treatment that starts concurrently with the initiation of targeted cancer therapy regimen. The primary endpoint will be assessed at the end of the initial (Stage I) 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled primary treatment phase after the last patient has completed 12 weeks of treatment. After completing the Stage I treatment phase, the subjects will have the option to remain on their assigned blinded treatment arm and reconsent to enter into the Stage II 12-week extension phase. The assessment of prophylactic effects on diarrhea will be measured by the average number of weekly loose and/or watery stools for the active (crofelemer) or placebo arms over 12-week Stage I treatment period.
A significant proportion of patients undergoing cancer therapy experience diarrhea, which has the potential to cause dehydration, potential hospitalization, and non-adherence to treatment in this population. Novel "targeted cancer therapy" agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with or without cycle chemotherapy agents, may cause increased electrolyte and fluid content in the gut lumen, which results in passage of loose/watery stools (i.e., diarrhea). Diarrhea has been reported as one of the most common side effects of TKIs and may result in cancer therapy drug holidays or reductions from therapeutic dose, potentially impacting patient outcomes. Diarrhea is also a common side effect of some approved CDK 4/6 inhibitors. 
With increased approval of several novel targeted therapies, it is estimated that 13.6% of cancer patients in 2020 were eligible for targeted therapies with or without standard chemotherapy regimens, according to a paper 

4




published in April 2021 in the journal Annals of Oncology1. According to the National Cancer Institute, in 2020, 1,806,590 new cases of cancer were diagnosed and nearly 250,000 of these newly diagnosed patients could be eligible for available targeted therapies.
Due to the chronic dosing and toxicity associated with targeted therapies, many cancer patients on targeted therapy require drug holidays or dose reductions in their therapy, including those due to diarrhea. By improving stool consistency and reducing the frequency of loose/watery stools, crofelemer is expected to provide improved adherence to the therapeutic dosing of any targeted therapies, potentially leading to better clinical outcomes. We have learned from discussions with cancer drug manufacturers that the adoption and continued use of targeted cancer therapies is directly related to the ability of patients to tolerate these therapies—highlighting the importance of supportive care drugs like crofelemer to help manage cancer treatment-related diarrhea in this patient population.
As previously announced, it has been reported that patients with cancer related diarrhea (CRD) were 40% more likely to discontinue the chemotherapy or targeted therapy than patients without CRD. The persistence of index cancer therapy and time to switch were also lower for patients with CRD. Strategies to control CRD and continue cancer therapy are urgently needed2.
Furthermore, it has been reported that patients with CRD used significantly more resources, including outpatient services, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. Effective prevention of CRD provides an untapped market opportunity to reduce the overall cost of cancer care3. Findings from studies have indicated that patients with CRD had nearly 2.9 times higher all-cause total cost of care than patients without CRD after adjusting for covariates. Thus, prophylaxis of CRD is expected to result in a significant reduction in cancer-treatment cost4.
As previously announced results from a dog study of crofelemer and an irreversible pan-HER2+ tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), neratinib, provide further scientific support for the evaluation of crofelemer in providing symptomatic relief of watery diarrhea in patients receiving a targeted cancer therapy drug like neratinib with or without cycle chemotherapy, without the use of loperamide, an antimotility drug.
The dog study was conducted without the prophylaxis or concomitant use of loperamide and demonstrated that crofelemer caused an approximate 30% reduction in the incidence and severity of diarrhea associated with daily oral administration of neratinib, within the 28-day treatment period. Crofelemer also demonstrated significant improvement in the proportion of “responder” dogs, and there was a trend for fewer neratinib dose reductions in crofelemer treatment groups when compared to the control group.
Crofelemer was evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study (called HALT-D), for the effectiveness of crofelemer for reduction of diarrhea in HER2 positive breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and chemotherapy agents such as docetaxel or pacilitaxel with or without carboplatin. These therapies cause CID in up to 80% of breast cancer patients, reaching grade 3, which often requires hospitalization, in 8-12% of patients. No antidiarrheal medications are currently approved that specifically target the underlying mechanism of CID associated with pertuzumab-containing regimens. The results of the study were published in October 2022 and showed that prophylaxis with crofelemer resulted in substantial reduction of higher grade diarrhea compared to the standard-of-care control group patients.
Recent studies have shown that EGFR inhibitors cause increased chloride secretion into the lumen of the gut and that crofelemer, through its unique and novel mechanism of normalizing the chloride-secretory actions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) and calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC), is

considered to be mechanistically- and physiologically-appropriate for reducing the loss of electrolyte and fluid in breast cancer patients receiving this regimen.
As announced October 26, 2022, the results of the HALT-D trial were published in the peer reviewed journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment. 
This HALT-D study evaluated 51 breast cancer patients who were eligible to receive at least three cycles of pertuzumab-containing regimen with chemotherapy that were randomly assigned to either crofelemer in cycles 1 and 2 or the control group, in which patients received standard of care. Breakthrough anti-diarrheal medicines (“BAM”) were permitted but not given prophylactically. Findings showed that the primary endpoint, the incidence of diarrhea for at least two consecutive days, was not statistically different for the two groups. However, crofelemer patients demonstrated significantly better outcomes compared to control group patients across a number of key secondary endpoints including reductions in the incidence and severity of diarrhea in cycle 2 based on Investigator and Patient Reported Outcomes (see Jaguar Health's November 19, 2021 press release). The study also showed that CID occurred significantly lesser (by 23%) in the crofelemer group during cycle 1 and crofelemer patients were 1.8 times more likely than control patients to have their diarrhea resolved. These data provide POC support to the primary endpoint in Napo’s ongoing phase 3 OnTarget clinical study.
Napo completed its requisite preclinical and formulation activities to support the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its second-generation, plant-based oral prescription drug product, NP-300, for its clinical development for the symptomatic relief and treatment of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, with or without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, from bacterial, viral and parasitic infections including Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. As announced in September 2022, the FDA has activated the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for NP-300and the FDA concluded that Napo may proceed with its proposed phase 1 clinical trial for NP-300. Following the completion of the phase 1 trial, the Company will be positioned to initiate the next stage of our clinical development program for cholera-related diarrhea when our development team has the requisite resources and bandwidth to initiate the additional required trials.
Cholera produces a devastating loss of electrolytes and fluid in patients and without appropriate reduction in loss of fluid and electrolytes, patients experience significant hospitalization and mortality. NP-300 provides the opportunity to treat cholera patients in combination with oral rehydration salts (“ORS”) and the recommended guidelines from the World Health Organization (“WHO”) for the use of appropriate antibiotics to reduce the burden of the pathogen. Appropriate preclinical toxicity studies and formulation development activities are ongoing to support the conduct of clinical studies with NP-300.
Napo received partial financial support for preclinical services from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”) of the National Institutes of Health, and Napo is grateful for their support of NP-300’s development.
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, an estimated 1.3 to 4 million people around the world get cholera each year and 21,000 to 143,000 people die from it. The infection is often mild or without symptoms but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 10 of infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. The largest cholera outbreak in recorded history recently occurred in Yemen. According to Oxfam, the number of cholera cases in Yemen in 2019 was the second largest ever recorded in a country in a single year, surpassed only by the numbers in Yemen in 2017. According to the Brookings Institution, cholera continues to spread in Yemen, with 180,000 new cases reported in the first eight months of 2020.
We expect that NP-300 will be significantly less expensive and would support development efforts to receive a tropical disease priority review voucher from the FDA for an indication for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea from acute infections such as cholera. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. Priority review vouchers are transferable and, in past 

6




transactions by other companies, have sold for prices ranging from $60 million to $350 million. Additionally, we believe NP-300 may provide a long-term pipeline opportunity as a second-generation anti-secretory agent for multiple gastrointestinal diseases—especially in resource-constrained countries.
The NP-300 program is paired with funding from a promissory note related to the potential future sale of a possible TDPRV.
As previously announced, the Company also launched the Entheogen Therapeutics (“ETI”) initiative to support the discovery and development of novel, natural medicines derived from psychoactive and psychedelic plant compounds for treatment of mood disorders, neuro-degenerative diseases, addiction, and other mental health disorders. The initiative is initially focused on plants with the potential to treat depression and leverages Napo’s proprietary library of approximately 2,300 plants with medicinal properties. According to statistics available from the National Institute of Mental Health Disorders, part of the National Institutes of Health, approximately 9.5% of American adults ages 18 and over will suffer from a depressive illness (major depression, bipolar disorder, or dysthymia) each year. 
Field research collaborations have been conducted in the past by members of the scientific strategy team (“SST”) of Jaguar’s predecessor company Shaman Pharmaceuticals, who are also members of the ETI SST, yielded possible applications for a compound called alstonine. Alstonine is derived from a plant used by traditional healers in Nigeria, and has demonstrated a potential novel mechanism of action for the treatment of difficult to manage conditions such as schizophrenia.
The ETI SST consists of leading and globally renowned ethnobotanists, physicians, and pharmacologists as well as experts in the fields of natural product chemistry and neuropharmacology. We believe the wealth of expertise, experience, and commitment of the ETI SST—comprised of multiple members of the original SST that contributed to development of Jaguar's proprietary library of plants—will play an instrumental role in advancing our shared initial goal of identifying plants in our library that may have the potential to treat mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic sclerosis. Mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases affect hundreds of millions of people around the globe and represent classic unmet medical needs.
While Napo and Jaguar remain steadfastly focused on the commercial success of Mytesi and on the potential development of crofelemer for CTD and the rare disease indications of SBS with intestinal failure and CDD, the Company believes the same competencies and multi-disciplinary scientific strategy that led to the successful development of Mytesi will support collaborative efforts with potential partners—such as the recently formed joint venture Magdalena Biosciences—to develop novel first-in-class prescription medicines derived from plants.
Our management team has significant experience in gastrointestinal product development for both humans and animals. Napo was founded more than 30 years ago to perform drug discovery and development by leveraging the knowledge of traditional healers working in rainforest areas. Ten members of the Jaguar and Napo team have been together for more than 15 years. Dr. Steven King, our chief sustainable supply, ethnobotanical research and intellectual property officer, and Lisa Conte, our founder, president and CEO, have worked together for more than 30 years. We have buttressed the early founding team with the expertise and experiences of team members like Dr. Darlene Horton and Dr. Karen Brunke to support the continued development and commercialization activities of the Napo and Jaguar family. We have assembled an impressive group of scientific advisory board (SAB) members that work closely with the Chair of Jaguar’s Scientific Advisory Board, Dr. Pravin Chaturvedi, who also serves as the Chief Scientific Officer (“CSO”) of Jaguar. Together, these dedicated personnel successfully transformed crofelemer, which is extracted from trees growing in the rainforest, to Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, which are natural, sustainably harvested, FDA-approved drugs.
As announced in February 2020, the American Botanical Council named Napo the recipient of the 2019 Varro E. Tyler Commercial Investment in Phytomedicinal Research Award in recognition of Napo’s ongoing commitment to the sustainable development and production of natural therapeutic preparations. Specifically, this award acknowledges the successful development and approval of crofelemer, which is derived from the Croton

lechleri tree in the Amazon rainforest. Previous recipients of this award include Jaguar’s partner, Italy based Indena S.p.A., one of the world’s largest producers of clinically-tested botanical extracts for the food, dietary supplement, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical markets.
Pipeline development opportunities for crofelemer 
Crofelemer is currently being evaluated for the prophylaxis of CTD in adult solid tumor patients receiving targeted therapy with or without standard chemotherapy. A significant proportion of patients undergoing cancer therapy experience diarrhea. Novel targeted cancer therapy agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may activate intestinal chloride secretory pathways leading to increased chloride secretion into the gut lumen, coupled with significant loss of water that would result in secretory diarrhea.
According to data appearing in “Treatment Guidelines for CID” (chemotherapy-induced diarrhea) in the April 2004 issue of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News, diarrhea is the most common adverse event reported in chemotherapy patients. Approved third-party supportive care products for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”) include Sustol, Aloxi, Akynzeo and Sancuso. According to a market research report by iHealthcareAnalyst, Inc., the global market for CINV drugs is estimated to reach a value of $3.9 billion by 2029.
Diarrhea has been reported as the most common side effect of the recently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and the pan HER TKI neratinib, with occurrence ranging from 86% to >95% and grade 3 over 40%, in published studies. Diarrhea in this patient population has the potential to cause dehydration, potential infections, and non-adherence to treatment. A novel antidiarrheal like crofelemer may hold promise for treating secretory diarrhea—and therefore also support long term cancer treatment adherence—in this population.
 Crofelemer was granted ODD for SBS by the FDA in August 2017 and by the EMA in December 2021. Crofelemer was granted ODD by the U.S. FDA in February 2023 for MVID, a rare CDD condition, and crofelemer received ODD for MVID from the EMA in October 2022. The Company is currently supporting investigator-initiated POC studies of crofelemer in patients with SBS with intestinal failure or CDD, focused on obtaining POC of reduction of requirements of parenteral support including parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluids, throughout 2023. In accordance with the guidelines of specific European Union countries, publications of POC data from these trials could support early patient access to crofelemer for SBS with intestinal failure or CDD in 2023 through programs in Europe. Early access programs are revenue generating, and reimbursable for participating patients.
The Orphan Drug Act (“ODA”) in the US provides for granting special status to a small molecule drug or biological product to treat a rare disease or condition upon request of a sponsor. This status is referred to as ODD (or sometimes "orphan status"). ODD qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and relief of filing fees. Additionally, the ODA provides a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity to the first sponsor who obtains marketing approval for a designated orphan drug.
In the EU, receipt of ODD supports some specific regulatory pathways, and sponsors who obtain ODD for their drug can benefit from Scientific Advice from the EMA for clinical trials for the orphan indication and receive market exclusivity for a period of ten years once the medicine is approved for commercialization.
CDD is a group of rare, chronic intestinal channel diseases, with onset in early infancy, that are characterized by severe, lifelong diarrhea and a lifelong need for nutritional intake either parenterally or with a feeding tube. CDD is related to specific genetic defects inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The incidence of CDD is prevalent in regions where consanguineous marriage (related by blood) is part of the culture. CDD is directly associated with serious secondary conditions including dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and failure to thrive, prompting the need for immediate therapy to prevent death and limit lifelong disability. A recent preclinical study shows that crofelemer reduces the chloride secretion in intestinal cells derived from patients with CDD and these preclinical results provide additional support and rationale for the use of crofelemer in treating patients with CDD and/or SBS with IF.
As previously announced (in 2019), a clinical research study sponsored by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (“UTHealth”) is being supported by Napo. This study evaluates the safety and 

8




effectiveness of crofelemer for treatment of chronic idiopathic diarrhea in patients. Chronic idiopathic diarrhea is a common complaint of patients presenting to family practitioners and internists and is one of the most common reasons for referral to gastroenterologists. It is estimated that the prevalence of chronic idiopathic diarrhea in developed countries (including the U.S.) is approximately 3-5%. It has a significant negative effect on health-related quality of life and causes a high economic burden on patients and society. The American Gastroenterological Association Burden of Illness study (2012) showed that the estimated annual direct and indirect costs associated with chronic idiopathic diarrhea is up to $524 million per year and $136 million per year, respectively. The principal investigator for this study is Dr. Brooks D. Cash, MD, AGAF, FACG, FACP, FASGE, Chief – Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Sterling Professor of Medicine, McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, Co-Director, Ertan Digestive Disease Center at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. The Study is titled Yield of Diagnostic Tests and Management of Crofelemer for Chronic Idiopathic Diarrhea in Non-HIV Patients.
Crofelemer is also being evaluated in another investigator-initiated trial for the management of functional diarrhea in non-HIV patients. This study is being conducted at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. This clinical study is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult subjects with functional diarrhea. Eligible patients will have functional diarrhea defined by Rome IV criteria as >25% loose watery stools and <25% hard/lumpy stools. The study plans to randomize 80 patients and the subjects will be randomized 1:1 for 4 weeks to either the placebo or crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets (Mytesi) arm, administered twice daily for 4 weeks. Following the four-week placebo-controlled period, all subjects will receive Mytesi for an additional four weeks in an open label extension phase. The safety and tolerability of crofelemer and the clinical response during the placebo-controlled period will be evaluated in this study. Subjects will be allowed to use limited amounts of an antimotility drug (loperamide) during the placebo-controlled and open-label extension phase to manage uncontrolled diarrhea. However, no more than 11 doses of 2 mg loperamide will be permitted during any given week per subject.
Jaguar’s and Napo’s portfolio development strategy involves meeting with Key Opinion Leaders (“KOLs”) to identify indications that are potentially high value because they address important medical needs that are significantly or globally unmet, obtain input on protocol practicality and protocol generation, and then strategically sequencing indication development priorities, second-generation product pipeline development, and partnering goals on a global basis.
Mytesi is the only antidiarrheal drug that has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of chronic, noninfectious diarrhea in adult HIV/AIDS patients receiving ART. This approval was on the basis of the drug’s safety and efficacy in reducing the number of weekly and daily watery stools in patients and improvement of stool consistency, from unformed to formed stools, over a 24-week treatment period.
Unlike other available diarrhea remedies, crofelemer does not act by inhibiting intestinal motility. It has minimal oral absorption and does not have any clinically significant food or drug interactions, thereby allowing patients to maintain their appropriate dosing of treatment to suppress their viral load and maintain adequate CD4 levels in PLWHA. Crofelemer is also the only approved antidiarrheal drug that is approved for chronic use. Moreover, it is not an opioid, like other traditionally used treatments, thus avoiding both the acute side effect of constipation and the potential for abuse.
There are significant barriers to entry for generic competition for Mytesi (crofelemer). Napo holds an extensive global patent portfolio. At the present time, we hold approximately 145 issued worldwide patents, with coverage in many cases that extends until 2031. These issued patents cover multiple indications, including HIV AIDS diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”), IBD, manufacturing, enteric protection from gastric juices, among others. We also have approximately 55 pending patent applications worldwide in the human health areas that are being prosecuted.
Mytesi is the first oral drug approved under the FDA’s Botanical Guidance, which provides another barrier to entry from potential generic competition. The FDA requires that the manufacturer of crofelemer use a validated proprietary bioassay to release the drug substance and drug product of Mytesi. While most generic products are fashioned to meet chemical release specifications that are in the public domain, the specifics of this assay are not 

9




publicly available. There is no pathway by which a generic product can be developed for a drug approved under botanical guidance. In addition, Mytesi is minimally absorbed systemically, so the classic approach of creating a generic drug by matching pharmacokinetic blood levels is not possible. A generic player would have to conduct costly and risky clinical trials.
While Jaguar’s commercial and development efforts have evolved to focus primarily on Mytesi and human pipeline indications since its merger with Napo, the Company commenced launch initiatives related to Canalevia-CA1, our drug product which received conditional approval in December 2021 for treatment of CID in dogs. CID in dogs is typically caused by the same mechanism of action as in humans, and hence the work in dogs serves as a preclinical proof of concept for the diarrhea in humans that is related to targeted cancer therapy. CID is an interesting model for human medical need and is being pursued as a prescription indication for animal health. We believe there is an important unmet medical need for the treatment of CID in dogs. Certain cancer treatment agents provided to dogs are human drugs or have the same mechanism of action as human cancer drugs, and these agents and mechanisms of action often have meaningful rates of diarrhea in humans as well.
As previously announced, Jaguar has received MUMS designation status from the FDA for Canalevia-CA1 for the indication of CID in dogs. MUMS designation is modeled on the ODD for human drug development and offers possible financial incentives to encourage MUMS drug development, such as the availability of grants to help with the cost of developing the MUMS drug.
Canalevia is also the Company’s drug candidate for the proposed indication of exercise-induced diarrhea (“EID”) in dogs.
Crofelemer is extracted and purified from the Croton lechleri tree, which we sustainably harvest and manage through programs that we have been developing over the past 30 years. This process has involved working with local and indigenous communities to plant trees, obtaining permits for export, and creating a supply network that is robust and reliable.
Our team continues to have relationships with partners that we began working with in the 1990s. Additionally, through the establishment of a nonprofit called the Healing Forest Conservancy, our team has created a long-term mechanism for benefit sharing that recognizes the intellectual contribution of Indigenous populations. This program is intended to contribute to the continued strength and effectiveness of the valued and strategically important relationships we have carefully cultivated over the past more than 30 years.

Product Pipeline
In addition to our Mytesi (crofelemer) product that is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy, we are also developing a pipeline of prescription drug product candidates to address unmet needs in gastrointestinal health through Napo. Mytesi (crofelemer) is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory antidiarrheal drug which has a normalizing effect to restore the electrolyte and fluid balance in the gut and lumen, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders. Clinical trials demonstrated that nearly 80% of Mytesi users experienced an improvement in their diarrhea over a four-week period. At week 20 of the pivotal trial, over half the patients had no watery stools, or a 100% decrease, and 83% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools. Our Mytesi pipeline currently includes prescription drug product candidates for multiple follow-on indications, several of which are backed by Phase 2 evidence from clinical trials. In addition, NP-300 is in development for symptomatic relief and treatment of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, with or without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, from bacterial, viral and parasitic infections including Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera.

Estimated Size of Mytesi Target Markets
We believe the medical need for Mytesi is significant, compelling, and unmet, and that doctors are looking for a drug product with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the options currently available to resolve diarrhea. A growing percentage of HIV patients have lived with the virus in their gut for 10+ years, often causing gut enteropathy and chronic or chronic episodic diarrhea. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was estimated that by 2020 more than 70% of Americans with HIV were 50 and older and had lived with HIV for more than 10 years (1).

The following diagram illustrates the mechanism of action of crofelemer, which normalizes chloride ion secretion and fluid content of the gut to improve stool consistency.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical company with first in class, sustainably derived products that address significant unmet gastrointestinal medical needs globally. To accomplish this goal, we plan to:
Expand Mytesi by leveraging our significant gastrointestinal product knowledge, experience and intellectual property portfolio
Mytesi (crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets) is a novel, first-in-class anti-secretory antidiarrheal agent which has a normalizing effect on the electrolyte and fluid balance in the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple gastrointestinal disorders. Our Mytesi (crofelemer) product is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. Jaguar, through Napo, holds global unencumbered rights for Mytesi. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including prophylaxis of diarrhea related to targeted therapy with or without standard chemotherapy. Crofelemer delayed-release tablets are also being evaluated in IBS-D and idiopathic/functional diarrhea.
Crofelemer powder for oral solution is being developed to support orphan or rare disease indications for infants and/or children with SBS and/or CDD, such as MVID.
In addition, a NP-300 is in development for symptomatic relief and treatment of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, with or without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, from bacterial, viral and parasitic infections including Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera.
Our management team collectively has extensive experience in the development of prescription drugs. This experience covers all aspects of product development, including discovery, preclinical and clinical development, GMP manufacturing, regulatory affairs, and commercialization. Key members of this team successfully developed Mytesi.
Maintain commercial capabilities in Mytesi sales and marketing efforts
Napo’s direct sales organization is comprised of Mytesi field sales representatives strategically positioned in different territories to cover U.S. geographies with the highest potential. With support provided by concomitant marketing, promotional activities, patient empowerment programs, including an integrated social digital campaign, and medical education initiatives described below, we expect a proportional response in the number of patients treated with Mytesi.

13




Leverage our relationships with Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) members for crofelemer commercialization and development in follow-on indications
The Company has retained several subject matter experts and KOLS as its SAB members across the therapeutic areas of HIV, CTD, gastrointestinal disorders, SBS, and/or CDD.

​
Establish partnerships to support moving pipeline indications to pivotal clinical trials
The Company’s goal is to establish partnerships to support moving pipeline indications towards commercialization in the US and/or other geographies.
Strategically sequence the development of follow-on indications of Mytesi and seek geographically focused licensing opportunities
As announced April 1, 2022, the Company has entered an agreement with Quadri Pharmaceuticals Store LLC (Quadri Pharma) that grants Quadri Pharma exclusive promotional, commercialization, and distribution rights for specified human indications of Mytesi (crofelemer 125 mg delayed-release tablets) in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Oman following regulatory approval to market crofelemer in these countries for the specified indications, including the indication currently approved in the U.S. for HIV-related diarrhea. They also have rights to commercialization, for Mytesi for CTD, for which crofelemer is currently in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, the agreement grants Quadri Pharma exclusive rights to distribute crofelemer in these countries in the immediate future under Named Patient Programs.
As announced September 24, 2018, Jaguar and Knight Therapeutics Inc. (“Knight”) entered into a Distribution, License and Supply Agreement that grants Knight the exclusive right to commercialize Mytesi and related products in Canada and Israel. The License Agreement has a term of 15 years (with automatic renewals) and provides Knight with an exclusive right to commercialize current and future Jaguar human health products (including crofelemer, NP-300, and any product containing a proanthocyanidin or with an anti-secretory mechanism) in Canada and Israel. Knight forfeited its right of first negotiation for expansion to Latin America. Under the License Agreement, Knight is responsible for applying for and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in the territory of Canada and Israel, as well as marketing, sales and distribution of the licensed products. Knight will pay a transfer price for all licensed products, and upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, the Company may receive payments from Knight in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $18 million payable throughout the initial 15-year term of the agreement. The Company did not have any license revenues since the execution of this agreement.
Although it is possible that we may enter into additional corporate partnering relationships related to Mytesi, our intention would be to retain all or co-commercialization and promotional rights in the U.S., so that we do not become primarily a royalty collecting organization, and we are opposed to entering into any Mytesi partnering relationship that would require splitting indications. We are seeking to put limited geographically focused partnerships in place in the near term, while also considering possibilities for a worldwide partnership with a leading global entity (excluding the U.S. exclusive commercial rights) in the field of gastrointestinal care and cancer in the long term.
Reduce risks relating to product development
Risk reduction is a key focus of our product development programs. Mytesi is FDA approved for a first-in-class chronic noninfectious diarrhea indication in adult HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (“ART”). This FDA approved New Drug Application (“NDA”) provides, us the ability to leverage this corresponding safety data when seeking approval for additional follow-on indications that are also chronic or chronic episodic indications. In an effort to reduce risk further, we have implemented the following approach: first, we meet with KOLs, including at medical conferences. Next, we confirm unmet medical needs with patients as well as KOLs and discuss the practicality of patient enrollment and trial implementation. We then generate protocols to discuss with the FDA, seeking, when possible, special protocol assessments. Our goal is to have de risked the program as much as we believe 

14




we possibly can, by the time we start devoting significant funds to a clinical trial, in particular the regulatory pathway. We believe this approach will lead to better long-term outcomes for our products in development.
We will continue to seek partnerships outside the United States for the above indications while focusing on development and commercial access in the United States directly. We are also focused on investigating NP-300 for various gastrointestinal indications. NP-300 is a proprietary Jaguar pharmaceutical product, a standardized botanical extract distinct from crofelemer, also sustainably derived from the Croton lechleri tree.
We believe NP-300, which has a similar mechanism of action as crofelemer and is significantly less costly to produce, may support efforts to receive a priority review voucher from the U.S. FDA for symptomatic relief and treatment of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, with or without concomitant antimicrobial therapy, from bacterial, viral and parasitic infections including Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA to drug developers for tropical disease indications (TDPRV) as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. Additionally, we believe NP-300 represents a long-term pipeline opportunity as a second-generation anti-secretory agent, on a global basis, for multiple gastrointestinal diseases—especially in resource constrained countries where the cost of goods is a factor, in part, because requirements often exist in such regions for drug prices to decrease annually.
The Company has previously presented Phase 2 data on crofelemer for the treatment of diarrhea in cholera patients from a study in Bangladesh. Napo plans to follow a similar clinical study design to support the development of NP-300 for a cholera-related indication.
Our portfolio development strategy is based on identifying indications that are potentially high value because they address important medical needs that are significantly or globally unmet, and then strategically sequencing indication development priorities, second-generation product pipeline development, and partnering goals on a global basis.
Our technology for proprietary gastrointestinal disease products is central to the product pipelines of both human and veterinary indications. Crofelemer is also the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in Canalevia-CA1, our prescription drug product conditionally approved by the FDA and launched for CID in dogs.

Napo Therapeutics Provides New Opportunities to Treat Orphan Indications Like SBS
Jaguar is strategically pursuing multiple important shots on goal for its drug development pipeline: Crofelemer for CTD, led by Napo, and crofelemer for SBS and CDD, led by Napo Therapeutics. Jaguar’s exclusive license agreement with Napo Therapeutics provides a perpetual, royalty-bearing license for Europe, and includes traditional terms such as royalties on sales in Europe, and a supply agreement, and rights to utilize all data Napo Therapeutics generates for Jaguar development and approval activities globally.
Competition
There are several significantly larger pharmaceutical companies competing with us in the gastrointestinal segment. 
Diarrhea in adult patients living with HIV/AIDs. We are not aware of any other FDA approved drugs for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea in HIV/AIDs patients. HIV/AIDs diarrhea patients may also use loperamide or Lomotil but these medications affect motility which can result in rebound diarrhea and are not indicated for chronic use. Other agents’ patients may use include over the counter anti diarrheal remedies such as Mylanta or Kaopectate.
Cancer therapy related diarrhea. We are not aware of any FDA approved drugs specifically indicated for prophylaxis of cancer therapy related diarrhea in patients receiving targeted therapies with or without standard chemotherapy. Opioids and over-the-counter drugs are commonly used to treat chemotherapy induced diarrhea, but these drugs affect motility. Certain tyrosine kinase inhibitor chemotherapy agents have diarrhea as a significant side effect. For example, FDA guidance suggests diarrhea prophylaxis prior to initiating adjuvant therapy with neratinib.

15




CDD. We are not aware of any FDA approved drugs specifically indicated for CDD. 
SBS with intestinal failure. In the U.S., Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ GATTEX® (teduglutide) is indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support. Zorbtive® is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for the treatment of SBS in adult patients receiving specialized nutritional support. To the best of our knowledge, no drugs have been approved in the US or rest of the world (ROW) for the reduction of parenteral support with a concomitant reduction in the high stool volume and diarrhea in SBS patients. 
Diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Two drugs were approved in 2015 for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome, Allergan plc’s Viberzi and Xifaxan, which is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Also, Lotronex was approved by the FDA in 2000 but was withdrawn from the market and later reintroduced in 2002 under a Risk Management Program. With the exception of Lotronex, the sponsors of Viberzi and Xifaxan employ extensive media and print promotion for the commercialization of these products.
Infectious diarrhea. We are not aware of any FDA approved drugs specifically acting as anti-secretory drugs to improve stool consistency. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) with or without the use of antibiotics is the current standard of care for infectious diarrhea. NP-300 provides a first of its kind antisecretory antidiarrheal drug which would potentially reduce the duration of diarrhea including its sequalae such as hospitalization.
Manufacturing
The plant material used to manufacture is crude plant latex (“CPL”) extracted and purified from Croton lechleri, a widespread and naturally regenerating tree in the rainforest that is managed as part of sustainable harvesting programs. The tree is found in several South American countries and has been the focus of long term sustainable harvesting research and development work. Napo’s collaborating suppliers obtain CPL and arrange for the shipment of CPL to Napo’s third party contract manufacturer.
Napo’s third party contract manufacturer, India based Glenmark Life Sciences Ltd. (“Glenmark”), a research driven, global, integrated pharmaceutical company, is Napo’s manufacturer of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi. Glenmark processes CPL into crofelemer utilizing a proprietary manufacturing process. The processing occurs at an FDA approved Glenmark facility. Additionally, Napo is establishing a second processing site, which will be operated by Indena S.p.A. (“Indena”), a Milan, Italy based contract manufacturer dedicated to the identification, development and production of high-quality active principles derived from plants, for use in the pharmaceutical, health food and personal care industries. Indena has completed the required validation activities to gain approval as a manufacturer of crofelemer drug substance.
As announced January 25, 2023, the required procedure of registering the source of the API of crofelemer with the Agenzia Italiana Del Farmaco (“AIFA”), the Italian Medicines Agency, has been successfully completed. Resultingly, batches of crofelemer API manufactured by Indena can now be used by Jaguar for further development work. This was a key milestone in the ongoing process of establishing Indena as an additional approved crofelemer manufacturer as we work to support the increased crofelemer manufacturing demand expected upon potential FDA approval of crofelemer for new indications, including approval for CTD.
Proprietary Library of Medicinal Plants
We possess a proprietary library of more than 2,300 medicinal plants.

17




Napo also has two international applications pending directed to alstonine derivatives and salts thereof and uses thereof for treating psychotic disorders which were filed on June 14, 2022, and October 26, 2022, respectively. 
Napo grants license to Napo Therapeutics 
On August 2021, Napo signed a license agreement with Napo Therapeutics to study, develop, manufacture, and commercialize Napo’s plant-based crofelemer and NP-300 drug product candidates in the European Union (excluding Russia) and in specified non-EU countries in Europe for specific indications, which rights and obligations were assumed by the combined company formed by the merger of Napo EU S.p.A. with Dragon SPAC (the combined company uses the Napo Therapeutics name). The license agreement grants Napo Therapeutics the rights for SBS-IF, HIV-related diarrhea, and the symptomatic relief and treatment of IF-related diarrhea in patients with congenital disorders. 
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of prescription drugs such as those Napo is that Jaguar and its subsidiaries are commercializing and/or developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of Napo’s drug product candidates. To comply with the regulatory requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which Napo is seeking to market and subsequently sell its prescription products, Napo has established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of its products and to position those products in order to gain market share.
U.S. Government Regulation
Human Prescription Drugs
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and it’s implementing regulations.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a human prescription drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for human clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) for human trials. Multiple sites may necessitate the involvement of multiple IRBs and submissions for human health products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18





● | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval of human prescription drugs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA advisory committees review, if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection (“PAI”) of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the drug product’s chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and effectiveness. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials for Human Prescription Drugs
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects pursuant to a clinical protocol, under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives or endpoints of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA under the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness depending on the endpoints set forth in the protocol.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Special Protocol Assessment for Human Health Prescription Drugs
The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate issues related to the adequacy of certain clinical trials, including Phase 3 clinical trials that can form the primary basis for a drug product’s efficacy claim in an NDA. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request.
The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding a SPA must be clearly documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.
Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:

• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study.
Marketing Approval for Human Prescription Drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; this would include information which supports dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.

20




The FDA may also require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA may also require other information as part of the NDA filing, such as an environmental impact statement. The FDA can waive some or delay compliance with some of these requirements.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMPs requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter must contain a statement of specific items that prevent the FDA from approving the application and will also contain conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use the of product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements for Human Prescription Drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, 

21




product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. New secondary indications must be supported by clinical trials or data. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMPs compliance.
Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, include, but are not limited to:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, the FDA regulates the purity and or consistency of the approved product. Products, if deemed adulterated, can lead to serious consequences as set forth above as well as civil and criminal penalties.
EMA Regulation of Human Prescription Drugs
Napo and Napo Therapeutics intend to leverage the orphan medicines marketing authorization incentives from the EMA for the SBS and CDD indications for crofelemer for the licensed territories in the European Union. EMA has developed a regulatory procedure for sponsor eligibility for incentives available for drugs with ODD for the appropriate patient populations in an expedited manner. The EMA is responsible for scientific evaluation of 

22




centralized marketing authorization applications (“MAA”). Once granted by the European Commission, the centralized MAA is valid in all EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
Centralized authorization procedure
Under the centralized authorization procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to EMA. This allows the marketing-authorization holder to market the medicine and make it available to patients and healthcare professionals throughout the EU on the basis of a single marketing authorization.
EMA's Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (“CHMP”) or Committee for Medicinal products for Veterinary Use (“CVMP”) carry out a scientific assessment of the application and give a recommendation on whether the medicine should be marketed or not. However, under EU law EMA has no authority to actually permit marketing in the different EU countries. The European Commission is the authorizing body for all centrally authorized product, who takes a legally binding decision based on EMA's recommendation. This decision is issued within 67 days of receipt of EMA’s recommendation. 
Once granted by the European Commission, the centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Commission decisions are published in the Community Register of medicinal products for human use.
Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases.
Conditional marketing authorization
The EMA supports the development of medicines that address unmet medical needs. In the interest of public health, applicants may be granted a conditional marketing authorization for such medicines on less comprehensive clinical data than normally required, where the benefit of immediate availability of the medicine outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.
Medicines for human use are eligible if they are intended for treating, preventing or diagnosing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases. This includes orphan medicines. Its use is also intended for a public health emergency (e.g. a pandemic). For these medicines, less comprehensive pharmaceutical and non-clinical data may also be accepted. The legal basis is Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The provisions for granting a conditional marketing authorization are further elaborated in Regulation (EC) No 507/2006.
Criteria and conditions
EMA's CHMP may grant a conditional marketing authorization for a medicine if it finds that all of the following criteria are met:

● | the benefit-risk balance of the medicine is positive;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the medicine fulfils an unmet medical need; and
--+------------------------------------------------


● | the benefit of the medicine's immediate availability to patients is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. Once a conditional marketing authorization has been granted, the marketing authorization holder must fulfil specific obligations within defined timelines. These obligations could include completing ongoing or new studies or collecting additional data to confirm the medicine's benefit-risk balance remains positive. EMA publishes the conditions of the marketing authorization in the medicine's European public assessment report.

23




The marketing authorization can be converted into a standard marketing authorization (no longer subject to specific obligations) once the marketing authorization holder fulfils the obligations imposed and the complete data confirm that the medicine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks. Initially, this is valid for 5 years. It can then be renewed for unlimited validity.
As for any medicine, if new data show that the medicine’s benefits no longer outweigh its risks, EMA can take regulatory action, such as suspending or revoking the marketing authorization. EMA can also take regulatory action if the company does not comply with the imposed obligations.
Despite earlier approval, it guarantees that the medicine meets rigorous EU standards for safety, efficacy and quality and that comprehensive data is still generated post-approval. It offers a robust post-authorization regulatory framework based on legally binding obligations, safeguards and controls.
These include:

● | full prescribing information and package leaflet with detailed instructions for safe use and conditions for storage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a robust risk-management and safety monitoring plan;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | manufacturing controls including official batch controls for vaccines, as required;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | legally binding post-approval obligations (i.e. conditions) for the marketing authorization holder and a clear legal framework for the evaluation of emerging efficacy and safety data;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a pediatric investigation plan.
--+--------------------------------

Guidance for applicants for conditional marketing authorization
EMA advises applicants to discuss their development plans with the EMA via scientific advice or protocol assistance early in the development process. Involving health technology assessment bodies early is also encouraged, which is possible via EMA's parallel consultations procedure. The applicant should indicate a request for conditional marketing authorization in their notification of intention to submit a marketing authorization application. They should submit this six to seven months before submitting the application. EMA also encourages applicants to further discuss their plans with EMA as part of a pre-submission meeting. For products deemed suitable for a conditional marketing authorization, EMA encourages applicants to also consider requesting accelerated assessment.
Applicants should include a formal request for a conditional marketing authorization in their marketing authorization application. The CHMP will assess this request together with the application. Guideline on the scientific application and the practical arrangements necessary to implement Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on the conditional marketing authorization for medicinal products for human use falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
Distinction from authorization under exceptional circumstances
EMA may also grant a marketing authorization in absence of comprehensive data under exceptional circumstances. Unlike conditional marketing authorization, where marketing approval is granted in the likelihood that the sponsor will provide such data within an agreed timeframe, EMA can grant authorization under exceptional circumstances when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization. This authorization route normally does not lead to a standard marketing authorization.

24




Orphan drug development incentives from EMA
Protocol assistance
The EMA provides a form of scientific advice specifically for orphan medicines called protocol assistance. This allows sponsors to get answers to their questions on the types of studies needed to demonstrate the medicine's quality, benefits and risks, and information on the significant benefit of the medicine. Protocol assistance is available at a reduced charge for designated orphan medicines, linked to a fee-reduction scale that depends on the status of the sponsor. There is no restriction on the number of times a sponsor can request protocol assistance.
The EMA encourages sponsors to consider coordinating the timing of protocol assistance from the EMA with request for scientific advice from the FDA. Parallel scientific advice with the FDA is available.
Access to the centralized authorization procedure
All designated orphan medicines are assessed for marketing authorization centrally in the European Union. This allows companies to make a single application to the EMA, resulting in a single opinion and a single decision from the European Commission, valid in all EU Member States. Sponsors may also have access via orphan designation to conditional approval, which is conducted under the centralized procedure.
Ten years of market exclusivity
Authorized orphan medicines benefit from ten years of protection from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved. This period of protection is extended by two years for medicines that also have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan granted at the time of review of the orphan medicine designation.
Additional incentives for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”)
Companies classified as SMEs benefit from further incentives when developing medicines with orphan designation. These include administrative and procedural assistance from the EMA’s SME office and fee reductions. 
Fee reductions
Companies applying for designated orphan medicines pay reduced fees for regulatory activities. This includes reduced fees for protocol assistance, marketing-authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees. Fee reductions are revised each year in relation to the budget available.
EMA Grants
The EMA does not offer research grants for sponsors of orphan medicines, but funding is available from the European Commission and other sources:

● | Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | E-Rare, a transnational project for research programs on rare diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grants are also available for sponsors considering research in the United States or Japan:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | United States: Food and Drug Administration: Orphan products grants program
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Japan: National Institute of Biomedical Innovation: Services to promote development of medicinal products for rare diseases
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25




Incentives in Member States
Details on incentives available for designated orphan medicines in EU Member States are available in the European Commission's Inventory of Union and Member State incentives to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan medicinal products.
Activities after orphan designation
Orphan designation makes the sponsor eligible for a number of orphan incentives. Sponsors need to comply with various activities that take place after a designation has been granted. Sponsors should submit all post-designation activities, including annual reports. For information and guidance on using IRIS, see the IRIS homepage. Sponsors must submit an annual report on development to the EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine.
Sponsors of medicines with orphan designation should also remember to apply for a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), deferral or waiver at the appropriate time, as specified in the Pediatric regulation. 
Sponsors also need to submit an application for maintenance of the orphan designation at the time of marketing authorization, in order to be eligible for the ten-year market exclusivity incentive. 
A valid and completed PIP could make the sponsor eligible for the two-year marketing exclusivity extension to the ten-year marketing exclusivity which is granted at the time of review of the orphan medicinal designation. Transfers of orphan designation from one sponsor to another are possible. Transfers are free of charge. Sponsors can also request removal of an orphan designation.
EMA Compassionate Use Program
Compassionate use is a treatment option that allows the use of an unauthorized medicine. Under strict conditions, products in development can be made available to groups of patients who have a disease with no satisfactory authorized therapies and who cannot enter clinical trials. The EMA provides recommendations through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), but these do not create a legal framework. Compassionate use programs are coordinated and implemented by Member States, which set their own rules and procedures.
Established by Article 83 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, this tool is designed to:

● | facilitate and improve access to compassionate use programs by patients in the EU;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | favor a common approach regarding the conditions of use, the conditions for distribution and the patients targeted for the compassionate use of unauthorized new medicines;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase transparency between Member States in terms of treatment availability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These programs are only put in place if the medicine is expected to help patients with life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously debilitating illnesses, which cannot be treated satisfactorily with any currently authorized medicine. The medicine must be undergoing clinical trials or have entered the marketing-authorization application process and while early studies will generally have been completed, its safety profile and dosage guidelines may not be fully established.
How to request an opinion for Compassionate Use
National competent authorities can ask EMA for an opinion on how to administer, distribute and use certain medicines for compassionate use. The CHMP also identifies which patients would benefit, and Member States should take note of these recommendations when making decisions.

26




Manufacturers and marketing-authorization applicants should not contact EMA to request an opinion, but they may wish to inform the EMA of applications underway at national level. National competent authorities will inform the EMA if they are making a product available to a group of patients for compassionate use.
Comparison to individual basis treatment (Named Patient Program)
Compassionate use should not be confused with 'named-patient basis' treatments, which see doctors obtain medicines directly from manufacturers before authorization. This is done on an individual basis under the direct responsibility of the doctor, and the EMA does not need to be informed.
In general, medicines that are not yet authorized are first made available through clinical trials and patients should always be considered for inclusion in trials before being offered compassionate use programs.
Compassionate use recommendations
EMA's recommendations cover how a medicine should be used in compassionate use programs across the EU, and the type of patient who may benefit from treatment. EMA does not update its recommendations after a medicine receives marketing authorization, as all relevant information on the medicine's use is available in its European public assessment report (“EPAR”). However, compassionate use programs may continue in certain Member States until the medicine becomes available on the market.
Rewards and incentives for pediatric medicines
Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the EU. Medicines authorized across the EU with the results of studies from a pediatric investigation plan included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months. This is the case even when the studies' results are negative.
For orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity.
Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization (“PUMA”). If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive. The above can be complemented by other incentives to support the research, development and availability of medicinal products for pediatric use.
Market exclusivity: Orphan medicines
Orphan medicines benefit from ten years of market exclusivity once they receive a marketing authorization in the EU. This measure is intended to encourage the development of medicines for rare diseases, by protecting them from competition from similar medicines with similar indications, which cannot be marketed during the exclusivity period. Market exclusivity is an orphan incentive awarded by the European Commission to a specific clinical indication with an orphan designation.
Each indication with an orphan designation confers ten years' market exclusivity for the particular indication. A medicine that has multiple orphan designations for different conditions will benefit from separate market exclusivity periods pertaining to its different orphan designations.
To benefit from market exclusivity, a medicine must maintain its orphan designation at the time of marketing authorization.

27




Extension of market exclusivity period
The market exclusivity period is extended by two additional years for an orphan-designated condition when the results of specific studies are reflected in the summary of product characteristics (“SmPC”) addressing the pediatric population and completed in accordance with a fully compliant PIP.
The European Commission grants the extension based on a positive compliance check from the Pediatric Committee and opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), and includes this information in the Community register of orphan medicinal products.
Review of market exclusivity period
Article 8(2) of the Orphan Regulation establishes the possibility for Member States to request that the market exclusivity be reduced from ten to six years, under certain circumstances. 
Expiry of market exclusivity
When the period of market exclusivity for an indication ends, the orphan designation for that indication expires and the European Commission removes it from the Community register of orphan medicinal products.
Once all of the orphan designations associated with an approved medicine have expired or been withdrawn by the sponsor, the medicine ceases to be classified as an orphan medicine and no longer benefits from the orphan incentives.
European Union new chemical entity exclusivity
In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants ODD to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
In the European Union, ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the ODD criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. ODD must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. ODD does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

28




European Union Pediatric Plan
In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan drug designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
Clinical Trials Regulation in Europe
In the EU, pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the EU member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the national competent authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the independent ethics committee for each site has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the individual EU member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is anticipated that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 may come into effect in late 2021with a three-year transition period for some types of clinical trials. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all EU member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws. 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the 

29




U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case by case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
Additionally, the intent standard under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have Anti-Kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off label, uses. Companies also have been prosecuted for allegedly violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act as a result of impermissible arrangements between companies and healthcare practitioners or as a result of the provision of remuneration by the companies to the healthcare practitioners. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state Anti-Kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Napo may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which Napo conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule, published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Animal Health Prescription Drugs
Under the FDCA, the term "drug" means articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary; articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and articles other than food intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. It also includes articles intended for use as a component of a drug.
Once a product is determined to be a drug for animal use, the next step is to determine whether or not it is a new animal drug. The FDCA defines a new animal drug (in part) as any drug intended for use for animals other than man, the composition of which is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. By virtue of Supreme Court interpretations of the necessary basis for general recognition, there are, for all practical purposes, no animal drugs which are not also new animal drugs.
Under the FDCA, a new animal drug may not be legally introduced into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of either: 

● | an approved NADA or abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) under section 512 of the Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a conditional approval under section 571 of the FDCA;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | a listing on the Legally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drug Index for Minor Species (the Index) under section 572 of the FDCA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31





● | an emergency use authorization (“EUA”) under section 564 of the FDCA (an EUA may only be issued under very limited circumstances, more information regarding EUAs is available at this webpage: Emergency Use Authorization) ; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an investigational exemption under section 512(j) of the FDCA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

Three Regulatory Pathways in the U.S. to Legal Marketing Status for Animal Health Drugs
Approval
An approved animal drug has gone through the New Animal Drug Application (NADA) process, or for an approved generic animal drug, the Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) process. If the information in the application meets the requirements for approval, FDA approves the animal drug. FDA’s approval means the drug is safe and effective when it is used according to the label. FDA’s approval also ensures that the drug’s strength, quality, and purity are consistent from batch to batch, and that the drug’s labeling is truthful, complete, and not misleading.
Conditional Approval
Conditional approval is only available for some animal drugs for use in a minor species or in a major species under special circumstances. A conditionally approved animal drug has gone through FDA's drug approval process except the drug has not yet met the effectiveness standard for full approval. FDA’s conditional approval means that when used according to the label, the drug is safe and has a “reasonable expectation of effectiveness.” FDA's conditional approval also means that the drug is properly manufactured.
The conditional approval is valid for one year. The drug company can ask FDA to renew the conditional approval annually for up to four more years, for a total of five years of conditional approval. During the 5-year period, the drug company can legally sell the animal drug while collecting the remaining effectiveness data. After collecting the remaining effectiveness data, the company submits an application to FDA for full approval. The agency reviews the application and, if appropriate, fully approves the drug.
Indexing
An indexed animal drug is a drug on FDA’s Index of Legally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species, referred to simply as “the Index.” As the name says, a drug listed on the Index is unapproved but has legal marketing status. It can be legally sold for a specific use in certain minor species. Indexing is allowed for drugs for:

● | Non-food-producing minor species, such as pet birds, hamsters, and ornamental fish. These animals are typically not eaten by people or by other animals that produce food for people to eat; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An early non-food life stage of a food-producing minor species, such as oyster spat (immature oysters). Because people do not generally eat oyster spat, a drug to treat a disease in spat can be indexed, but a drug to treat a disease in adult oysters, which people commonly eat, cannot be indexed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indexing a drug is quite different from the drug approval process. Indexing relies heavily on a panel of qualified experts outside FDA. The experts review the drug’s safety in the specific minor species and the drug’s effectiveness for the intended use. All experts on the panel must agree that, when used according to the label, the drug’s benefits outweigh the risks to the treated animal. If FDA agrees with the panel, the agency adds the drug to the Index.
Animal Health Business Regulations
The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to seek approval, where necessary, to market and subsequently sell our prescription 

32




drug and non-drug products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of our products and to position those products in order to gain market share in each respective market.
Certain U.S. federal regulatory agencies are charged with oversight and regulatory authority of animal health products in the United States. These agencies, depending on the product and its intended use, may include the FDA, the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency. The approval of prescription drugs intended for animal use is regulated by the FDA’s CVM. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration regulates animal therapeutics that are classified as controlled substances. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission may, in the case of non-drug products, regulate the marketing and advertising claims being made.
Labeling
The FDA plays a significant role in regulating the labeling, advertising and promotion of animal drugs. This is also true of regulatory agencies in the EU and other territories. In addition, advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and approved by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell our product candidates.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical products for which Napo obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use Napo’s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of Napo’s products. Sales of any products for which Napo receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will, therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, the process for determining whether a third party payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third party payer not to cover Napo’s product candidates could reduce physician utilization of Napo’s products once approved and have a material adverse effect on Napo’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable Napo to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Napo’s investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third party payer’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require Napo to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of Napo’s products to each payer separately and will be a time consuming process.
In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of 

33




new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low priced markets exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third party payers do not consider Napo’s products to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover Napo’s products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow Napo to sell its products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to the utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs covered under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. Since its enactment, the U.S. federal government has delayed or suspended the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA.

Napo expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that Napo receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent Napo from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Napo’s drugs.
Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.

Napo expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for Napo’s products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Other Regulatory Considerations
We believe regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our animal prescription drug product candidates are not intended for use in production animals, with the exception of horses, which qualify as food animals in Europe and Canada; and our nonprescription products are not regulated by section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which the FDA is authorized to administer.
We do not believe that our animal nonprescription products are currently subject to regulation in the United States. The CVM only regulates those animal supplements that fall within the FDA’s definition of an animal drug, food or feed additive. The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act defines food as “articles used for food or drink for man or other animals and articles used as components of any such article.” Animal foods are not subject to pre-market approval and are designed to provide a nutritive purpose to the animals that receive them. Feed additives are defined as those articles that are added to an animal’s feed or water, as illustrated by the guidance documents. Our nonprescription products are not added to food, are not ingredients in food, nor are they added to any animal’s drinking water. There is no intent to make our nonprescription products a component of an animal food, either directly or indirectly. We do not believe that our nonprescription products fit the definition of an animal drug, food or food additive and therefore are not regulated by the FDA at this time.
In addition to the foregoing, we may be subject to state, federal and foreign healthcare and/or veterinary medicine laws, including but not limited to anti-kickback laws, as we may from time to time enter consulting and other financial arrangements with veterinarians, who may prescribe or recommend our products. If our financial relationships with veterinarians are found to be in violation of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Other than as set forth in “Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS”, there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
