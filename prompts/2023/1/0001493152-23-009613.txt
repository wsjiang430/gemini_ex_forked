ICT Industry in Asia
 
Asia has become a hotbed for adoption of some new technologies in recent years, especially in the field of Internet of things (IoT) and robotics. This is partly driven by manufacturing firms, most notably in China, which are rapidly deploying these solutions. It also reflects commitments from Asian governments and business leaders to leverage new technologies as a solution to the region’s economic and demographic challenges, such as robotics as a response to curb labor shortages in Japan. Smart city investments in the region are also eye-catching, with the high penetration rate of mobile devices allowing some countries to ‘leapfrog’ legacy technologies. The challenge will be to increase broader adoption of software solutions which have the potential to deliver a more transformative economic impact1.
 
Driven by the rapid growth of IoT in recent years, coupled with the investments in the manufacturing and transportation industries, new technologies are already approaching $1 trillion in annual revenue. Over the next few years, other new categories such as robots/drones and AR/VR headsets in addition to related software and services will see similar growth. This increasing proportion of spending targeted at new categories will drive the overall industry to a new growth surge over the next decade as businesses move beyond prototyping into broader deployments of technologies such as augmented reality viewers and AI-enabled robots.

ICT Industry – Hong Kong
 
Hong Kong’s role as a leading business center in the Asia region can be evidenced by its advanced telecommunications infrastructure. According to Global Information Technology Report 2016 by the World Economic Forum, Hong Kong is in the third rank in Asia (12th in the world) in the Networked Readiness Index, indicating Hong Kong’s advanced position in telecommunications infrastructure, regulatory environment, and business readiness of using information technology. 2 The ICT sector of Hong Kong is among the most advanced in the world. According to the annual global ICT Development Index published by ITU in November 2017, Hong Kong ranked second in Asia after Korea, and sixth in the world. 3
 
The industry of information and communications in Hong Kong had generated HK$84.1 billion (US$10.7 billion) of value added during 2016, contributing to 3.5% of GDP. In term of industry data, Hong Kong had household broadband penetration rate at 92.6% (as at February 2018). 4 The Hong Kong Internet connection speeds are among the highest in the world, according to the Office of the Communication Authority. In Hong Kong, IT products and services suppliers were the largest category of IT users, accounting for 34.2% of total IT employment, followed by the wholesale, retail, import/export, restaurants and hotels sector (28.8%), the financing, insurance, real estate and business services sector (17.9%), and the community, social and personal services sector (11.4%).4
 
Hong Kong’s ICT spending is on track to grow 3.8% in 2018 to HK$144.42 billion, according to the latest projections from Gartner. Total spending on technology and products in the market is projected to turnaround following a 9.2% decline in spending in 2017, and grow a further 1.9% in 2019 to reach HK$147.19 billion. Communications services will remain the largest category overall, but total spending in this category is projected to decline slightly from 2017 to HK$49 billion. Spending on devices by contrast will increase significantly to HK$47.9 billion, taking it closer to becoming the top spending category in the Hong Kong market. Spending on software will also increase by 9.2% to HK$13.15 billion, and the IT services segment will grow 3.5% to HK$28.4 billion. Data center systems spending will by contrast stay mostly flat at HK$5.89 billion. 5

Hong Kong government has put in place initiatives to foster the ICT industry development, which included funding support, provision of infrastructure, international cooperation and manpower development. One of the example will be The Smart City Blueprint, which unveiled in December 2017, maps out development plans for the next five years to enhance Hong Kong sustainability by making use of innovation and technology. The Hong Kong government’s Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) has provided an alternative source of funding for the IT industry. As of end-March 2018, the ITF had approved 7,359 funding applications on projects with a total of HK$ 14 billion. Last but not least, Hong Kong has a large pool of skilled ICT professionals, providing services to clients spanning a wide range of businesses. According to the 2016 Manpower Survey Report conducted by the VTC, 87,794 persons were employed in principal jobs of the IT sector.6

ICT Industry in ASEAN
 
The economy in Southeast Asia region is expected to grow at a yearly average of 5.2% from 2018 to 20227, with studies projecting the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) to become the fourth largest single market in the world by 20308 - putting it behind only the US, China and the European Union. The region’s steady growth is fueled by an increasingly well-educated workforce, a wealth of natural resources, rapid urbanization and growing infrastructure spending. In addition, ASEAN is in a strategic location in the confluence of major trade routes, with US$5.3 trillion of global trade passing through each year9. Our company sees that the opportunity of ASEAN’s strong and vibrant economy, favorable demographics, ICT investments, and ongoing economic integration have laid the foundation for rapid growth in the digital economy.
 
10The six largest economies in ASEAN (Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Vietnam) contribute 99% of the total ASEAN GDP. Many of the fundamentals are already in place:
 

● | Robust economy generating GDP of $2.5 trillion and growing at 6 percent per year 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Literate population of more than 600 million people, with 40 percent under 30 years of age 
● | Well-developed information and communications technology (ICT) cluster with a track record of innovation and investment in new technology

ICT Industry in Malaysia
 
Malaysia, where our company is based in, is the fourth largest economy in Southeast Asia and is known for its high labor productivity and diversified economy. Over the years, the country has transformed itself from being a primary commodities exporter into a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts, and components. Moving up the industrial value chain, it has also established itself as an attractive regional ICT hub for services, information and technology, and e-commerce.
 
The ICT industry has contributed recorded 18.3% to the national economy in 2017 as compared to 16.5% in 2010. This industry showed an increasing average annual growth rate of 9.0% over a seven-year period. The contribution of ICT comprised 13.2% while the rest is contributed by e-commerce in non-ICT industries. The contribution of the ICT industry to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) recorded a growth of 8.4% with a value of US$45 billion. This information can be found at https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php.
 
In March 2017, Malaysia launched the world’s first Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ)11 outside of China that aims to capitalize the confluence and exponential growth of the internet economy and cross-border e-commerce activities. The DFTZ is expected to double the growth rate of small and medium enterprises’ goods exports to reach US$38 billion and facilitate US$65 billion of goods movement via the DFTZ (exports, imports, transshipments) by 2025. More than 2,000 small and medium enterprises stand to get easier access to the global market, especially the Chinese market, through the DFTZ. The DFTZ is also expected to generate 60,000 new jobs in the country by 2025.
 
In its 2018 budget12, the government announced wide-ranging incentives to support businesses, including capital allowance for ICT equipment and software, tax relief on services provided by the local authorities, and extended application period for principal hub tax incentive among others. The principal hub tax incentive aims to increase Malaysia’s competitiveness as the global operations hub for multinational companies by offering tax exemptions to companies that set up their global operation centers in Malaysia. The budget also announced National Transformation 2050 vision that aims to improve the qualitative growth factors of the economy such as labor force skills by preparing its citizens for future challenges such as the fourth industrial revolution - artificial intelligence, robotics, digitalization, etc.

ICT Industry in Indonesia
 
Meanwhile in Indonesia, the country has the fastest growing mobile market in the Asia-Pacific region, while globally, it is the 4th largest mobile market in the world. The country has an extremely high penetration rate in mobile device at 112%, meaning 260 million of the country’s population has access to a mobile device13. This, combined with drivers like mass consumption of products, urbanization, and a tech-hungry young population, has resulted in rapid development in the ICT industry in the country.
 
Currently, the country’s ICT industry has a primary focus on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and cloud computing, providing solution such as data analytics, data center management, and managed services. In July 2019, Softbank has announced a $2 billion investment in Indonesia, aimed to upgrade the digital infrastructure of the country.

The government of Indonesia has also introduced different initiatives and national programs, including Go Digital Vision 2020, e-smart IKM and 100 Smart City Movement to drive the country’s economy towards the digital edge. These programs aim to develop local startups, support small to medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as to prepare and embrace internet of things (IoT). Most notably, the Making Indonesia 4.0 road map launched in April 2019 seeks to diversify the economy away from a reliance on natural resources by developing higher-tech export industries. The plan will focus on areas like 3D printing, artificial intelligence, human-machine interface, robotics and sensor technology, all of which require advanced digital capacity. As such, the government expects to create between 7 million and 19 million new jobs between 2018 and 2030 to support the development of the industry. The government also expects a growth in the industrial sector’s gross domestic product contribution from 20 percent to 30 percent over the same period.14
 
Indonesia has already achieved its goal to become largest digital economy in South East Asia by 2020, valued at US$40 billion. Driven by the socio-demographic and fiscal factors, the market value of Indonesia’s digital economy is expected to reach $130 billion by 2025.

ICT Industry in Thailand
 
Whereas in Thailand, the industrial hub of South East Asia, the country is still in the starting/developing stage in its ICT industry. The country’s ICT industry is dominated by the hardware market, including CCTV and smart Bluetooth, which account for 67% of the industry value15. Meanwhile, software and digital services account for the remaining. As such, the potential of the industry is still largely untapped and more advancement into digital spectrum can be expected.
 
The government of Thailand is also stepping up its effort to encourage development of new start-ups with tech focus. It has set up the Board of Investment (BOI), a government agency to promote Foreign Direct Investment into the country by providing information, services, and incentives. Some of the incentives include permission for 100% foreign ownership, up to 15 years exemption in corporate income tax, and permission to bring in experts and skilled workers and their families. The initiative aims to encourage firms like venture capitals and corporate incubators to enter the local market, provide mentorships and accelerator programs that will help to get startup off the ground and contribute to the growth of technology16. The BOI is also targeting to increase funding of national research and development to at least 1% of Thailand’s GDP with the targeted ratio of public to private R&D investment of 30:70, which private firms will enjoy higher benefits of this initiatives17.
 
Looking forward, International Data Corporation (IDC) Thailand predicts that from 2019 to 2022, IT-related spending in the country will reach US$72 billion. 60% of Thailand’s IT spending will also be on 3rd platform technologies with 30% of enterprises will seek to build “digital-native” IT environments. Also, by 2024, it is expected that AI-enabled user interfaces and process automation will replace one-third of today’s screen-based apps in Thailand. The IDC also expects 61% of the country GDP, roughly U$317 billion (based on 2019 GDP level) will be digitalized by 202218.

ICT industry in Vietnam
 
Vietnam has enjoyed its own economic miracle in recent years, showing the world how it turned the country from one of the poorest nations in the world to become a middle-income nation. The Southeast Asia country has grown its GDP for an average 6.8% 19over the past two decades to reach US$ 255 billion in 2019, rivalling China’s result during this period20.
 
Along with the economy, the country’s ICT industry has also experienced substantial growth of average 31.1% per year from 2014 to 2019. The industry’s revenue reached US$110 billion in 2019, driven by government’s initiatives, rising middle class, growing internet usage, and a young population21.
 
Similar to Thailand, the hardware segment dominates the Vietnam ICT industry, accounting for 86% of the industry revenue in 2017. However, in recent years, the industry has seen tremendous potential in areas like software and services, evidenced from increased adoption of software and service by the private and public sectors. At the same time, the country has emerged as a destination of software outsourcing, competing directly with India, China, and Philippines. It is currently the eight largest provider of IT services globally.
 
Various government incentives have been introduced to encourage further development in the ICT industry. Amongst the incentives, government has exempted 100% of corporate income tax for IT companies for up to four years, followed by 50% tax exemption for up to nine years. Subsequently, the corporate income tax rate for IT Company will stay at 10%, compared to a 20% tax rate for traditional companies. The government has also implemented a zero percent value-added tax for computer programming activities.
 
On the other side, new hi-tech parks will be constructed across the country from 2015 to 2030 though a combined effort by central and local government, and private capital22. The hi-tech parks will offer various benefits to investors to move into the hi-tech parks. For example, the Da Nang High-tech Park offers CIT incentives, import duty exemptions, as well as one-stop administrative procedures for investors located in the park23.

ICT industry in Philippines
 
The ICT industry in Philippines is relatively young compare to other countries, but the country has started to receive growing attention and foreign investment in recent years. One of main reasons is the relatively low standard in the country’s telecoms sector, as a result of lack of competition and limited investment.24
 
In order to overhaul the broadband capabilities, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Philippines has introduced the National Broadband Plan (NPL) in 2017, an US$ 4 billion initiative to deploy fiber optic cables and wireless technology to further expand 3G, 4G, and LTE services throughout the country25. Since then, steady progress in 4G availability has been made and is set to make further progress.
 
Currently, Business process outsourcing (BPO) is one of the country’s leading generators of income. In fact, DICT has projected around $38.9 billion revenue will be generated in the BPO service in the next six years25. In the past year, the ICT sector has also become top investment contributor for the country in 2019, attracting US$6 billion of foreign investment26. Moving forward, the focus of the country will remain in upgrading the network capabilities. The development in passive telecommunication infrastructure such as fibre optic cables, cable landing stations and submarine fibre optic is expected to contribute an annual investment inflow of US$1.9 billion until 2022.

We strongly believe that our team with years of experience in the ICT industry will be able to reinforce the importance of digitization and incubate promising entrepreneurs in the ICT industry who can shape the country’s future. With the experience of our officers and directors in this industry, we believe that we are able to benefit our members by making recommendations pursuant to the digital economy, conducting market analysis, and tracking digital progress metrics throughout Southeast Asia.
Financial and Corporate Advisory Team
 
Growing strong regional entrepreneurs is not our sole aim, we also aspire to build an ICT ecosystem in the region through the tool of securitization that could assist our clients to compete on the world stage. As such, we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the National ICT Association of Malaysia (PIKOM), and GreenPro Capital Corp (NASDAQ: GRNQ) to enter into a partnership to create greater value for the high-growth emerging companies in the ASIA region. In collaboration with Greenpro, our corporate development advisory services can be flexible arrangement, custom fitted for members and their needs. We provide advisory services to ascertain that our clients are well structured and have clearly delineated funding options available in the capital marketplace.
Corporate Program
 
Despite the technological advancements, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in ASIA are still low in both technology and skillsets. With our Corporate Programs, we intend to match and enhance performance of ICT entrepreneurs based upon a spectrum of availability, innovation environment, regulatory environment, and digital literacy. It is our intention to create corporate programs through which our community clients may have an opportunity to attend seminars, workshops, promotional events that showcase industry expertise during key cross-countries Southeast Asia events. All such plans remain in development and we have yet to determine a timeline when such programs will become available.
Future Plan
 
Marketing
 
We plan to explore tech-based marketplaces and attract IT startup entrepreneurs around ASIA countries through building our corporate image and awareness through corporate seminars, website and pitching events. Further, we had developed a corporate website which will introduce our SEATech Corporate Ventures Program.

Expansion and Targeted Market
 
In the next financial year from 2022 onwards, we plan to recruit three to five engagement partners in every country that we operate. The Company anticipates expanding into the ASIA market initially to Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. The qualifications and capabilities are individuals with vast experiences in the ICT industry, able to provide in-depth analysis, corporate management advice and developing business solutions for ICT companies that intend to grow, as well as to carry out performance assessment, strategic planning and implementation of pre-set goals and plans.
 
In addition, we will hire additional staff in Malaysia within a year of the public listing of the Company. We believe that hiring fifteen to twenty employees, which may include accountants, public relations and ICT business consultants, will be sufficient in order to support our operations. It will also be necessary for us to acquire office space from which we can conduct operations and conduct meetings with potential clients. We also plan to allocate funds to support our ICT Incubator Program. However, such development will require intensive research, development and testing so we cannot accurately determine a concrete timeline at present nor have we determined an appropriate budget for these future activities. We may also evaluate potential acquisitions and venture opportunities in the future which we feel may have some synergy with our current operations when the Company is successfully listed in the US capital market.
 
Competition
 
SEATech focuses on providing mentoring and advisory services to ICT companies in ASIA. The venture capital industry in ASEAN or even the ASIAN region has grown substantially over the years, as more start-ups, especially those with ICT focus, will require mentoring and incubation services in order to move to the next level. Henceforth, the venture capital industry is getting more competitive and SEATech intends to improve its visibility and the provision of its advisory services in order to stand out from the competition. The Company will seek to improve its competency in ICT so as to create a competitive advantage over our existing and/or potential competitors.
