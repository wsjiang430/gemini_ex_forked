Item 1. Business.
Our History
 
We develop and sell smart eyeglasses and sunglasses, which are designed to allow our customers to remain connected to their digital lives, while also offering prescription eyewear and sun protection. Founded and headquartered in Miami, Florida, we were initially organized as a Florida limited liability company effective August 15, 2019. We were founded by Lucyd Ltd., the inventor and licensor of the technology that our products are based upon which is a portfolio company of Tekcapital Europe Ltd. (“Tekcapital”). Tekcapital is a U.K. based university intellectual property accelerator. Tekcapital builds portfolio companies around new technologies. On March 26, 2020, we converted from a Florida limited liability company into a Florida corporation.
Our Product
 
In January 2020, we introduced our first beta product and began market testing.
 
In January 2021, we officially launched our first commercial product, Lucyd Lyte® (“Lucyd Lyte”). This initial product offering embodied our goal of creating smart eyewear for all day wear that looks like and is priced similarly to designer eyewear, but is also light weight and comfortable, and enables the wearer to remain connected to their digital lives. The product was initially launched with six styles, and in September 2021, an additional six styles were added.
 
We recently launched version 2.0 of our Lucyd Lyte eyewear, and our current product offering consists of 16 version 1.0 models and 15 version 2.0 models, which offers a similar amount of style variety as many traditional eyewear collections. All styles are each available with 70 different lens types, resulting in hundreds of variations of products currently available.
 
Additionally, Lucyd Lyte glasses enable the wearer to listen to music, take and make calls, and use voice assistants to perform many common smartphone tasks hands-free. Some of the many things that can be done with Lucyd Lyte glasses include:
 

1. | “Send a voice message to (contact)”: this command begins the recording of an audio message to be sent to named contact. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | “Send a text to (contact)”: begins recording of a speech-to-text message to be sent by SMS to named contact. 
3. | “Call (contact)”: speed-dials the named contact. 
4. | “Send $___ to (contact)”: this command allows our user to send money to a contact via Venmo or Apple Pay. Follow the digital assistant’s prompts to confirm. 
5. | “Check my messages”: this command reads out our user’s latest incoming text messages and offers a prompt to reply to each. Close out the digital assistant to end the readout. 
6. | “Check my mailbox”: this command announces the number of unread emails, and reads them out with a prompt to continue after each one. In the prompt after each one, our customers can tell their digital assistant “Reply” and dictate an email response to the previous email.
7. | “Find (cuisine type) food nearby”: this command reads through a list of nearby restaurants and their ratings, and prompts our user for directions or to call after each one.

8. | “Call me an Uber”: this command prompts our user on which type of Uber ride they want, then asks to confirm to send a car to our user’s location.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. | “What time is it?”: announces the current time. 
10. | “Play (song/album/artist)”: this command begins playing the requested song, album or artist via Apple Music. 
11. | “Get me directions to (location)”: this command begins navigating on phone, with audible directions on glasses. 
12. | “Take a memo”: this command begins recording a speech-to-text memo in Notes. Say “Read my Notes” to play back. 

 
Since the launch of Lucyd Lyte, we witnessed interest and demand from customers throughout the United States and have sold thousands of our smart glasses. Within six months of the launch of Lucyd Lyte, several optical stores in the United States and Canada have on- boarded the product and we have had discussions with several other large eyewear chains (by number of locations) regarding onboarding our product. We believe smart eyewear is a product category whose time has come, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on and help develop this exciting new sector–where eyewear meets electronics in a user-friendly, mass market format, priced similarly to designer eyewear.
 
In first quarter of 2022 we introduced a virtual try-on kiosk for select retail stores. This device introduces our products to prospective retail customers and enables them to digitally try-on our line of smart glasses in a touch free manner.
 
We anticipate introducing six styles of Nautica smart eyewear, six to twelve additional styles of Lucyd Lyte glasses, and our first Bluetooth safety glasses in 2023. In addition, we anticipate the following upgrades to accessory products in 2023:
 

● | The patent-pending Lucyd charging dock will be upgraded to feature a charging status LED and USB data capability, enabling it to be used as a USB hub for computers in addition to a charging hub. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Lucyd virtual try-on kiosk will be upgraded with a store control panel enabling the kiosk owner to change the display into Spanish language mode and control which frames and lens options are shown in the digital experience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we introduced key features in the Vyrb app, including live broadcasts for up to 100 users in one digital “room”, and the ability to upload external audio content into Vyrb, enabling longstanding content creators to import their existing libraries swiftly into the platform. Also in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed development of core audio eyewear product improvements, such as upgrading all frames to quadraphonic sound, which have been rolled out across all new eyewear models as of January 2023.
 
Our Mission
 
Our mission is to Upgrade Your Eyewear®. Our smart eyewear is a fusion of headphones with glasses, bringing vision correction and protection together with digital connectivity and clear audio, while also offering a safer solution for listening to music outdoors (as compared to in-ear headphones). The convenience of having a Bluetooth headset and comfortable glasses in one, especially for those who are already accustomed to all-day eyewear use, offers a lifestyle upgrade at a price most consumers can afford.
 
In a sense, we view this integration of technology and vison correction/protection as the next evolutionary step in the development of eyewear. Over the entire course of eyewear development and history, many of the innovations have dealt with improving the lenses of the glasses. Notably, eyewear frames have not improved much in the past 400 years, with the exception, in our view, of the utilization of plastic to reduce weight and provide a wider range of designs and finishes, and the introduction of new hinge types. We view the integration of Bluetooth technology into the arms of the glasses as one of the key next steps to Upgrade Your Eyewear®.
 
Our focus is to enhance one of the world’s most important wearables: eyewear.

Additionally, as part of our commitment to a great customer experience, we listen to feedback from our customers, and continuously strive to improve customer satisfaction and experience with our products. Our customers’ extensive feedback pointed to a need and desire for better interaction with social media while on-the-go. We are addressing this need by developing an exciting software application called Vyrb™, which enables Lucyd Lyte users to hear and reply to social media posts, with their voice, hands-free, through their glasses (“Vyrb”). Other Vyrb users will be able hear these posts. Additionally, Vyrb offers Lucyd Lyte users external social media sharing features, which allow posts made on Vyrb to be exported to other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We launched Vyrb in December 2021 for both iOS and Android, and we believe that Vyrb is one of the first social applications designed specifically with a focus on smart glasses and other voice enabled wearables. We subsequently expanded Vyrb’s capabilities through software upgrades released in the fourth quarter of 2022, and anticipate the commercial launch of Vyrb in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 
We have made strong strides towards our goal of making smart eyewear accessible to the mass market. Several developments towards this end include developing our smart frames in two temple lengths, with a third length planned for 2023; the introduction of smart eyewear specifically for women and youth, which are typically missing from similar offerings; and the introduction of smart eyewear for adults with petite or narrow faces. In addition, we have launched an expansive offering consisting of 16 version 1.0 models and 15 version 2.0 models so far, which offer a similar amount of style variety as many traditional eyewear collections. When paired with the Vyrb application, Lucyd Lyte glasses will provide a new and safer wearable user experience suitable for everyone.
 
Our goal is to become a meaningful player in the smart eyewear market. Innovative Eyewear’s early successes have shown our ability to not only compete, but to lead in this rapidly changing and expanding technological eyewear market, and our goal is to continue spearheading innovation in the field.
 
Giving Back
 
We donate an optical frame for every Lucyd Lyte sold at retail locations.
 
We are also very active in supporting the various communities we serve through donations and support. From the beginning, Innovative Eyewear has supported those in need through its donation of glasses frames to New Eyes (https://new-eyes.org/about-us), a charity dedicated to helping children and adults in need of eyewear. We’ve partnered with New Eyes because they fit the Lucyd brand mission: enhancing the vision of people all over the world, and we believe that it simply is the right thing to do.
 
Additionally, university students, educators, healthcare workers, uniformed service members, and veterans are eligible for an ongoing 18% discount off all frames and lens upgrades on www.lucyd.co.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
A Unique Solution to a Common Problem. While immensely useful, smartphones can present a safety hazard to motorists, pedestrians and cyclists because smartphones can distract people from the task or activity at hand. In 2021, pedestrian deaths were at a 40-year high according to the Governors Highway Safety Association, and experts believe smartphones were partially to blame. Recent data from the Governors Highway Safety Association indicates that from 2010 to 2020, the number of pedestrian deaths rose by 54%, while all other traffic deaths increased by 13% (Pedestrian Traffic Fatalities by State: 2021 Preliminary Data – (https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians22). We believe that the distraction created by smartphones originates in two forms: (1) via headphones or earbuds, where the user is deprived of full audible situational awareness; and, (2) via the visual interface of the phone, which distracts the user completely from their surroundings. Lucyd Lyte open ear audio helps address this problem by having the speakers mounted at the temples (in the arms) of the glasses. There is nothing in the ear canal and, as a result, individuals can better maintain situational awareness, such as hearing the traffic around them, as well as nearby sounds. Many of our competitors have relatively bulky speakers enclosed within the temples, while Lucyd Lyte’s speakers and temples are thin, which allows them to look similar to traditional designer glasses. Furthermore, through the quick and easy touch controls on the Lucyd Lyte, the wearer can perform many tasks that they would normally pull out their phone for, untethering the eyes of the user from their smartphones throughout the day and enabling them to remain more visually vigilant and aware of the traffic around them.

Affordable Price Point. Our Lucyd Lyte eyewear provides both optical-quality glasses and a Bluetooth headset together, at roughly the same price as a traditional pair of designer glasses, which is core to the disruptive potential of our product. Our Lucyd Lyte line of smart eyewear enables prescription and sunglass wearers to interact with digital assistants and social media without having to take their eyes off the road and are nearly handsfree, thereby improving the safety and convenience of taking calls, listening to music and audibly accessing digital information on the go. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (“MSRP”) for Lucyd Lyte 2.0 eyewear starts at $199, with advanced options and customizations available at higher price points, which are at the discretion of the customer. A basic prescription lens upgrade is offered for $40. By comparison, most of our U.S.-based competitors offer products that are more expensive, starting at approximately $249 or higher, with higher costs to add prescriptions.
 
Quality. All of our frames can be outfitted in-house or by optical resellers with any combination of prescription, sunglass, readers and blue light formats. Our frame fronts are made with what we believe are high quality optical materials to ensure easy lens fitting by any optician.
 
Customizable Product Offering. There are 70 lens types available for Lucyd Lyte, making it the most customizable smart eyewear in the world. Innovative Eyewear has a partnership with a high-quality optical lab in Boston to produce prescription and custom lenses for our frames quickly and affordably. Our contract with a third-party optical lab also allows us to offer direct prescription fulfillment to our customers.
 
Comfort. At just 1.0-1.45 ounces, our eyewear has a feather-light fit, suitable for all day vision correction or sun protection (traditional glasses weigh about 1 ounce). This is especially important while on the go. Our 1.0 ounce titanium aviators are among the lightest smart eyewear ever made.
 
Long Battery Life. At 12 hours of playback per charge, Lucyd Lyte 2.0 glasses outpace most, if not all, of the competition on battery life.
 
Capital Light Business Model. All of our products are sold through multiple e-commerce channels, including on our website (Lucyd.co), BestBuy.com, DicksSportingGoods.com and Amazon.com, and are distributed through optical or other retailers (such as, but not limited to, Metro Optics Eyewear and Marca Eyewear Group, Inc.). We believe this capital light approach is highly scalable and efficient in the deployment of resources. We view “capital light” as being more efficient by obviating the need to build factories and retail stores, while partnering with existing companies in both of these groups.
 
Multiple-Channel Approach. We sell our products both through multiple online channels and multiple categories of brick-and-mortar retail stores. We believe this multi-channel approach provides us with an advantage against our competitors who sell in a narrower selection of channels.
 
Experienced Management Team. We have an experienced board of directors with more than 80 years of combined experience in the eyewear industry, and a management team with substantial experience in software and electronics engineering and operating eyewear and technology companies.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
When we organized Innovative Eyewear two years ago, there were, in our view, no attractive smart eyewear that addressed the basic consumer need for good looking designer glasses that were stylish, comfortable, lightweight and provided the functionality of hearables, and priced around the same as regular glasses.
 
All of our products are designed in Miami, manufactured in China, and sold through e-commerce, channels, including on our website (Lucyd.co), BestBuy.com, DicksSportingGoods.com and Amazon.com, or sold by over 200 optical and sporting goods retailers. Additionally, we are pursuing online and in-store big box retailers, and in-store and online specialty Based on the existing demand for our products, current distribution and recently consummated supply agreements, we anticipate that our products will be available in a significant number of new third-party retail locations in 2023.

We believe that people care about what they wear on their faces, and because we understand that customers have diverse preferences about the shape, size, and design of their eyewear, we aim to continuously introduce new models in an effort to offer a wide variety of designs. We continuously present new models of eyewear to our network of followers to vote on those styles they find most appealing. We view this as community approved design.
 
Sales
 
We have two major sales channels: (1) e-commerce via Lucyd.co and Amazon and, (2) our ongoing development of a network of eyewear, sporting goods and electronics resellers, including but not limited to, BestBuy.com, DicksSportingGoods.com and Brookstone, to offer our frames. Most of our resellers are experienced opticians who provide valuable feedback that informs the development of our product lines, which we would not receive if we were solely direct to consumer. Additionally, we have a robust presence on multiple e-commerce and social media platforms, which facilitates several customer on-ramps for the Lucyd brand, and numerous ad campaign strategies. Building on our early successes of driving traffic to Lucyd.co, the website run by a subsidiary of our majority stockholder, from Facebook and TikTok, we deploy high quality content on multiple platforms to continuously keep customers engaged and drive brand awareness.
 
We have two levels of margins, one for business to consumers (“B2C”), and one for business to business (“B2B”). The majority of our sales have been through e-commerce with current gross margins of approximately 75%; retail sales have gross margins of approximately 40%. Lens upgrades sold on Lucyd.co have a standardized profit margin of approximately 35%. As a company still in an early growth stage, we are investing heavily in our B2C and B2B efforts to capture as much market share as possible, which included in fiscal year 2022 several activities which impacted the gross deficit. Among these promotional activities were single-item B2C discounts, heavy B2B discounts on large bulk orders, a large number of free sample units provided to media, influencers and reviewers, and significant spending on upsells, promo items, and merchandising materials which were in many cases given to B2C and B2B customers for free. Additionally, the logistical costs of the high number of B2C returns in fiscal year 2022 contributed to the deficit. However, with the better establishment of the Lucyd brand expected in 2023, and with the current improvements to the product and increase in MSRP by $50, we expect to neutralize the gross deficit in fiscal year 2023 as our per-unit profitability is increasing. We expect that our retail sales will account for the majority of our sales by the end of 2023.
 
E-commerce Channels
 

1. | Company website: Lucyd.co
---+--------------------------

 
Lucyd.co is our primary e-commerce point of sale. The site offers the most customization options of any of our sales channels and a full prescription lens lab, offering a total of 70 different lens combinations (21 key lens tints offered in plano, single prescription and progressive bifocal; seven types of reading lenses). Additionally, the Lucyd website ships worldwide and is used to provide a quick and smooth buying experience.
 

2. | Amazon
---+-------

 
Amazon.com/lucyd is our brand shop on Amazon. It drives approximately half of our online sales, but limits the number of variations we can offer on our frames (e.g., prescription lenses are not permitted on Amazon). However, through Amazon, we are still able to offer color lens sunglass variants and blue light blocker pairs, in addition to our charging dock accessory item. We are constantly testing traffic flow to Lucyd.co vs. Amazon to ensure our online ad spend is fully optimized.
 

3. | Walmart.com, BestBuy.com, DicksSportingGoods.com, Brookstone.com, eBay and Touch of Modern
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our key online sales channel through Lucyd.co, our products are also sold on Walmart.com, BestBuy.com, DicksSportingGoods.com, Brookstone.com, and eBay.

4. | Social Selling
---+---------------

 
Not only do we use social media to drive traffic to our main sales channels, but we also take advantage of intra-social shops as well, and have deployed shopping experiences through Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to gain further brand awareness.
 
We also offer two affiliate platforms via shareasale.com and Shopify for peer-driven sales. The Shareasale program is for professional affiliate and deal promotion companies, and increases revenue on Lucyd.co by offering direct commissions in exchange for converting web traffic. The Shopify affiliate program enables Lucyd brand enthusiasts to get a financial reward for sharing the brand, and operates on similar terms as the Shareasale program where we provide a commission rate in exchange for converting web traffic.
 
Retail Channels
 

1. | Independent Eyewear Stores
---+---------------------------

 
The core of our B2B business is formed by our relationship with numerous eyewear store retailers across the United States and Canada, which provide Lucyd Lyte frames directly to their optical customers. Many of these retail stores have placed multiple stocking orders since launching our wholesale business in June 2021. To support our resellers, we offer a strong co-op marketing program that includes free store display materials. As part of this strategy, we have launched a digital try-on kiosk for our resellers to help educate their in-store customers about Lucyd eyewear, and increase our brand’s physical presence in the optical industry. We have launched our in-store digital try-on kiosk to key retailers in December 2021 and we have upgraded the kiosk’s capabilities to allow for the customer to try different lens tints, explore an FAQ, download the company’s Vyrb™ social app, and enable in-store reordering from the kiosk.
 

2. | National Eyewear Chains
---+------------------------

 
Lucyd eyewear is currently being evaluated by multiple leading eyewear chains in the United States for potential inclusion in their brick-and-mortar stores. After the recent introduction of Ray Ban Stories smart eyewear, many retailers are keen to include one or more smart eyewear products in their stores and on their e-commerce platforms. Based on our current discussion with several major optical chains (by store size), we believe at least one major optical chain or national optical buying group will onboard our product line in 2023.
 

3. | Big Box Retail Stores (Electronics, sporting goods, general merchandise)
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to mainstream optical channels, we have begun placing our products and are pursuing additional product placements with leading big box stores, either in their eyewear or electronics departments. Specifically, we have begun selling our products on Bestbuy.com and Dickssportinggoods.com.
 

4. | License Agreements and Specialty Retail Stores
---+-----------------------------------------------

 
We are leaving no stone unturned in our mission to bring smart eyewear mainstream. We have licensed two leading fashion brands, Nautica and Eddie Bauer, to produce new powered by Lucyd cobranded frames, which will be launched in 2023 on Lucyd sales channels as well as in select Nautica and Eddie Bauer stores. Additionally, we are pursuing other potential sales outlets such as home shopping channels, cellular stores and boutique retailers.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
Our products are designed and specified in the United States and subsequently manufactured in China. The products are designed in-house, 3-D CAD files are then produced with product renderings. We then subject these rendered images for focus group review, to determine which designs we should move to the prototype development stage. Pre-production prototypes are developed by our factories in China to our specifications. Our factories source components for the smart eyewear in China including plastic and titanium for the frames, electronic components, speakers, microphones and batteries. All packaging is designed in Miami and fabricated in China. Once completed, our products are tested in the United States, to assess functionality, fit and finish. Production orders are placed and fabricated in China based on anticipated demand, whereupon they undergo a rigorous thirteen-point third party product inspection process. The inspection is conducted on 100% of our manufactured products. Inspections include testing procedures to help ensure our customers receive only functional, high-quality products. For large bulk orders from clients, we are able to order this inventory on demand, due to the expected lead times in the traditional frame sourcing business.
 
All of our frames are manufactured with prefabricated, ready to wear sunglass or blue light lenses, and are directly shipped to the customer in this state if the customer declines purchasing custom lens upgrades. If a customer orders with prescription or specialty lenses, then the smart eyewear frames are sent to an optical contractor laboratory in Boston, Massachusetts, to have the lenses cut, ground and mounted in the frames, whereupon they are directly shipped to customers.
 
Our in-store kiosks are comprised of a fixture, a tablet, and proprietary software, which enable the prospective customer to virtually try on our smart glasses. The fixtures, which sport our Company name, are manufactured by a U.S.-based third-party company, and are designed to serve as a holding mechanism for the tablet. We purchase each tablet through Amazon.com, which is then fitted to the kiosk fixture. The Company currently utilizes Samsung’s tablets for its in-store kiosks. Once each tablet is fitted to its kiosk fixture, the tablet is loaded with software which ultimately presents the Company’s try-on application. This software-based chain of processes relies on the tablet’s built-in camera and enables the prospective buyer of our smart eyewear to virtually try-on the glasses, which are superimposed in different styles onto the customer’s face using the front-facing camera. The tablet is fitted to the kiosk and loaded with our software in our Miami facility, from where they are shipped to a third-party warehouse in Miami for distribution to retail stores.
 
Marketing
 
We employ a 360-degree marketing strategy that encompasses both brand and user generated content syndication across earned, owned and paid platforms (channels where the company pays a fee to have its product advertised). Long form and video content generation are a key focus points for the brand, they allow us to better leverage both emerging and critical smart eyewear narratives through persistent search engine optimization (SEO); increasing our organic brand awareness across the board, in addition to strategic loyalty, influencer and affiliate marketing campaigns.
 
Our online marketing strategy is primarily driven by pay-per-click advertisements on mainstream search engines, social media apps, and Amazon and other marketplaces. In addition, we support our primary efforts with influencer created and promoted “UGC” (user-generated content), email automations and newsletters, and website push notifications. We have also deployed nationwide broadcast cable TV campaigns and plan to use this channel in the future.
 
We believe we are trendsetters in creating relevant, omni-channel touchpoints that derive meaningful experiences and products designed for our customers.
 
Our wholesale marketing strategy is primarily focused on traditional sales email and call outreach, national and regional optical trade shows, and optical and athletic trade advertisements.

From a brand perspective, strategically offering value-added optical smart eyewear coupled with expansive end-user customization our social audio app initiatives can potentially rapidly expand brand awareness and revenue. At Innovative Eyewear, we strive to lead and own critical narratives within the Bluetooth and smart eyewear space.
 
We seek to create memorable experiences and products that resonate with our customers, coupled with premium content and campaigns designed to expand our brand presence and market share. We also attend major regional eyewear and sporting goods trade shows to build awareness among our potential retail partners.
 
Our influencers
 
To accelerate brand awareness and product sales, we are embarking on an influencer strategy to engage leading figures in sports and the arts, who like and enjoy wearing Lucyd Lyte®. To date we have onboarded Chris Clark, a pro golfer, Monique Billings, a WNBA basketball player, and Hadar Adora, an up-and-coming musical artist. We plan to add additional influencers to enhance awareness and sell-through for a number of key demographics.
 
Influencers are a key part of our marketing strategy, as they help our products relate to large, variable audiences. Lucyd Lyte is a perfect fit for the fitness tech and audio product spaces, so athletes and musicians are a natural fit for our brand and the active lifestyles that Lucyd products promote. We plan to add A-list musical talent to the brand in the near future, as well as a host of audio content creators to support the Vyrb experience.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
According to Statista, the total addressable market for eyewear in the U.S. is projected to be $33.8 billion in 2023. The market for digital assistants like Siri, Google Voice, Bixby and Alexa has grown rapidly worldwide, and is projected at $4.5 billion in revenue in 2023. The worldwide hearables market was estimated at $69.0 billion in 2022. We view the popularity of hearables as an important catalyst for the smart eyewear market.
 
The common denominator among markets for the hearables and digital assistant is that they facilitate real-time access to digital data, whether it is through music, calls, navigational directions, or information, among other uses. The combination of hearables and digital assistants provides a transparent, ergonomic interface between the users and their digital lives. At Innovative Eyewear, we are dedicated to a touch-free interface and untethering our customers eyes from their smartphone screens, through our smart eyewear product.
 
The synergistic fusion of these three markets enables, in our view, an opportunity to create a completely new experience of connected eyewear, which smoothly delivers the functionality of both optical glasses and headphones, eliminating the need for either on its own. Nevertheless, several orthodoxies of the eyewear industry still hold, namely: if you want to sell a lot of eyewear, we believe it should be attractive, stylish, comfortable (e.g., lightweight, which we believe to be approximately 1oz) and cost roughly the same as traditional eyewear. This is what we have sought to achieve, and in our view have accomplished with the introduction of Lucyd Lyte eyewear.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We license from Lucyd Ltd., a subsidiary of our majority stockholder, an intellectual property portfolio designed to protect our unique eyewear designs and certain technological features in current and anticipated future products. More recently, the company has begun filing patents under its own name.
 
We have licensed and filed 48 patents to date, covering all of our current product designs and certain advanced features such as Vyrb, replaceable front frames, and multi-channel Bluetooth connectivity. The Company will seek to file new IP to protect new styles and features of its smart eyewear as they are introduced.

Under the terms of the License Agreement, we have the exclusive right to effectuate sublicenses, either exclusively or non-exclusively, to any or all of our licensed intellectual property, at its sole discretion. Upon execution of the License Agreement, we paid Lucyd Ltd. £1 for the life of the licensed assets, and the License Agreement shall continue in perpetuity, unless terminated according to the terms of the agreement. Additionally, we issued 3,750,000 shares of our common stock to Lucyd Ltd. as compensation for entering into the License Agreement and for the contribution of certain other assets. Lucyd Ltd. may terminate the license with immediate effect by providing written notice to us if, among other things: we commit a material breach, as such is defined by the terms of the agreement; or, if we suspend, or threaten to suspend, payment of our debts or are unable to pay our debts.
 
The License Agreement requires us to indemnify Lucyd against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties, and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other reasonable professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by Lucyd Ltd. arising out of or in connection with actual or alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights; our breach or non-performance of or the enforcement of License Agreement.

For all new intellectual property, Innovative Eyewear will own and control it and be responsible for all prosecution and maintenance costs. The Addendum also confirms that Innovative Eyewear issued Lucyd Ltd. 3,750,000 shares of its common stock as consideration for the license.
 
Sales Representation Agreement
 
On March 4, 2021, we entered into a commission-only, sale representation agreement with D. Landstrom Associates, Inc. for prospecting a wholesale relationship with Walmart, Target and Best Buy stores in the United States (the “Representation Agreement”). The Representation Agreement provides for D. Landstrom to act as our commission based, manufacturer’s representative, with the exclusive right to solicit offers on behalf of us to purchase our products in the United States, for the named big box stores. The term of the Representation Agreement is five years. Contract may be terminated for “good cause” with 90 days’ notice by either party. Upon termination, commissions of orders procured will extend 180 days beyond termination date. Thus far, the representation has resulted in a successful launch of the Company’s products on BestBuy.com.
Distribution Agreement
 
On June 30, 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with 8 Points Inc., a subsidiary of Marca Eyewear Group Inc., for exclusive distribution of Lucyd Lyte products in Canada (the “Distribution Agreement”). The Distribution Agreement provides that 8 Points Inc. will have exclusive purchase and distribution rights and obligations in Canada. The term of the Distribution Agreement is 3.5 years and either party may terminate by providing 180 days’ notice to the other party. The distributor will perform services, which shall include, but shall not be limited to the following):

1. | Sales of our products into retail distribution by servicing potential purchasers and by generating new business within the Territory (as defined in the Distribution Agreement).
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13

 


2. | Handling of all account inquiries on sales made pursuant to this Distribution Agreement.

5. | Distributor will provide logistic service to distribute the product in the territory covering all provinces and provide internal customer service and warehousing and shipping, as well as after purchase care to customer. 
6. | Distributor will provide a minimum purchase of $4.6 million worth of Lucyd Lyte products over 30 months to maintain exclusivity for sales in Canada. 
7. | Monthly minimum committed purchases increase incrementally over the term of the Distribution Agreement.

The distributor has not met the requirements to maintain exclusivity; as such, we have converted the Distribution Agreement to a non-exclusive contract in accordance with the terms of the agreement as outlined above.
 
Nautica® License Agreement
 
On September 28, 2022, we entered into a multi-year global licensing agreement with Nautica Apparel, Inc., which became effective July 1, 2022. Pursuant to this agreement, we received a license to utilize the global lifestyle brand Nautica® for our smart eyewear products. The company intends to launch their first line of Nautica Powered by Lucyd sport lifestyle audio glasses in 2023. This agreement requires us to pay royalties based on a percentage of net retail and wholesale sales, and also requires guaranteed minimum royalty payments. The agreement has a base term of 10 years but is cancellable at our option during the fifth year. The future minimum payments due during the noncancelable portion of the contract term (2022-2027) are approximately $1.1 million in aggregate; future minimum payments due during the remaining term of the contract (2028-2032) are approximately $3.6 million in aggregate.
The Next Step
 
Vyrb™ Social Audio App
 
We believe eyewear should enable customers to freely interact with social media. While digital assistants, once enabled, can provide the basis for this interaction, we believe that the ability to receive and send social media posts with an individual’s voice may greatly enhance ease of use of these platforms on the go. To facilitate this, we have been developing Vyrb, our full stack social media application that enables the user to receive and send posts through Lucyd Lyte smart glasses with an individual’s voice. The application launched out of beta in December 2021, and the further development of the Vyrb app is continuing on pace, with two major features launched in December 2022: the ability to host live audio streams with up to 100 visitors and six live speakers at a time; and the ability to import external audio files into Vyrb, which allows longstanding podcasters and other content creators to add their content libraries into Vyrb. After the introduction of several more features and key user experience improvements, we anticipate a commercial launch of Vyrb in the fourth quarter of 2023. At or soon after this time, advertising and monetization features will be introduced into the app to make it a new revenue stream for our business.
 
14

 

We believe that Vyrb will enhance the utility of current and future Lucyd Lyte glasses by enabling users to be untethered from their smartphones, yet still be able to hear and make social media posts. A goal of our products is to free our customers from other technologies. As such, we are designing Vyrb with a transparent, voice-centric interface in mind, so that as soon as our customers can say “Ok Google,” they are connected to a world of engaging audio content and have the ability to create audio posts and messages. We believe social interaction via smart eyewear will be instrumental in bringing new, youthful customers to our company.
 
A number of companies recently have started to launch voice mediated social media applications, such as Clubhouse, Discord, Audlist, Listen and Riffr. We are designing Vyrb to host audiobooks, podcasts and entire music albums on the platform. With Vyrb, Lucyd Lyte customers are able to hear their social media feeds, post messages, hold gatherings and musical performances (by inviting other Vyrb users to connect with each other at a specific date and time), and enjoy social media with the authenticity of their own voice, all through their eyewear and without taking their phone out of their pocket.
 
The Product and Market for Vyrb
 
Vyrb is being designed as a full social media experience to enhance voice-based communications on wearables and mobile devices. The sophistication of Vyrb’s interface enables a large array of in-app purchases and subscriptions, as well as easy connectivity with the Lucyd Lyte line of smart eyewear. In addition to an ad-driven revenue model that is typical of social media applications, the robust and highly variable selection of planned in-app purchases provide important improvements and fine-tuned customizations to help personalize the user experience. We plan to roll out these and other exciting features of Vyrb over the course of several software updates.
 
The Vyrb app is contemplated to feature an in-app item shop with a number of fun and useful upgrades, such as:
 

● | Loot Boxes — Random packs of multiple upgrade items, a best-selling in-app purchase format frequently deployed in online video games.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Skins — Items that alter the appearance of the app to help personalize it to the user’s preferences, such as Dark Mode.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accents — Items that change the accent used by the app’s text-to-speech engine, which is employed frequently to vocalize textual content.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Metal Mics — Items that lengthen the maximum allowable verbal post length and image/video sizes per post for users.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post Embellishments — Items that can be used to animate posts in the feed to make them more prominent.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sound FX Packs — Items that increase the number of audio emojis (Sound FX) available to the user, livening up their posts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ad Tokens — Items that can be spent to expand the reach of a feed post to a larger audience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vyrb Gold — A premium, monthly subscription to the app that blocks all ads and brings additional benefits like a more prominent username.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vyrb Gems — In-app currency that can be spent to tip a user’s favorite content creators, to buy premium paywalled content and to buy certain other in-app purchases. Gems can also be traded to other users for their items on the Vyrb Marketplace module. Users will also be rewarded Gems for their engagement with ads on the platform, creating a positive feedback loop that rewards app engagement with premium content and experiences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15

 


● | Command Tokens — Items that can be spent to create new custom voice assistant commands (based on Vyrb’s Voice Command Creation Interface).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mega-Tag Tokens — Items that can expand the number of mega-tags available to the user (mega-tags are a unique Vyrb feature, they are automatically applied hashtags that make a user’s posts more discoverable to others).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Users spend approximately 145 minutes per day on social media applications and regularly click on advertisements they view through their applications. We believe Vyrb is strategically positioned to become a prime advertisement space, allowing both visual and audible advertisements to be purchased. Vyrb ads will be shown in a user’s regular newsfeed, which we believe will create an opportunity and need for a subscription in-app purchase (Vyrb Gold) for a premium, ad-free browsing experience. For ease of use, Vyrb ads can be created by any user through the application in just moments: users will be able to purchase “Ad Token” items from the in-app store, and then use these tokens to turn standard posts into wide-reaching ads. A rapid-response reporting system will be developed and monitored to remove objectionable or illegal content from the platform. With its focus on high quality audio, we are designing Vyrb to lift up professional and creative audio content developers by helping them reach new audiences. To ensure a positive user experience, we are developing a system in Vyrb which will automatically promote positively reviewed content, and automatically remove content that has been reported in a high ratio compared to the number of viewers, providing the basis for user product discovery as well as a failsafe against any mistake in our manual and algorithmic moderation of the application’s hosted content.
 
Vyrb users will be able to purchase and support content from indie and professional creators via an in-app currency (referred to as “gems” in this document, a virtual point the user typically accumulates by viewing ad content or by purchasing them). Creators will receive gems from typical users as tips during live broadcasts, and in exchange for access to premium posts. The creators will then be able to cash out these gems at an exchange rate that provides profit to Vyrb. For example, users purchase the gems, its in-app loyalty token at a rate of $1 each, but creators only receive $0.75 for each gem they cash out. A 25% effective platform fee would put the content transaction fees of Vyrb at a lower rate than most digital content marketplaces. In the case of typical livestreaming applications, a functionality Vyrb supports, they are often exorbitant, taking as much as 50% in effective fees on in-app currency transactions.
 
To acquire the gems, users must buy them in the Vyrb Shop or gain them by engaging with sufficient ad content (e.g., using the application for an hour, or an amount of time that effectively pays for the gem). While Vyrb allows users the flexibility of choice of either buying or earning these gems, we believe that there is a huge revenue stream potential for us through a strategic implementation of the Vyrb Shop and peer-to-peer content transactions.
 
Also, we plan for users to be able to charge a fixed price to be able to access particular audio posts. For example, this feature could be used by a podcaster to sell their premium episodes, or by a recording artist to sell their music albums. In tandem with this feature, audio posts will be divisible into tracks to support long form content such as albums and audiobooks. Vyrb will take a flat percentage fee on all sales of premium content within the application by allowing creators to cash out gems they receive for selling their content. We believe the major benefit of this system is that it will provide audio content creators a new platform for rapidly creating, listing and selling their content, and help create an environment full of rich, unique and interactive audio experiences such as live “radio shows,” indie content and virtual concerts for typical Vyrb users.
 
We believe that Vyrb will effectively leverage multiple successful gamification models from the world of social media to provide a flexible and highly interactive user experience that can potentially draw high-value content creators. A fundamental aspiration of Vyrb is to provide a new platform and source of revenue for high quality audio content creators in particular; to that end, we designed Vyrb with a goal of providing a rapid, user-friendly platform for creators and consumers to share, sell and enjoy the best audio the web has to offer. We believe that through Vyrb, we can make the interaction between our users and our product a fun and rewarding experience, which can also be monetized by the company and content creators alike. By putting audio front and center, we hope to provide a new meeting ground for audio content creators and those who enjoy lots of music, podcasts and talk shows. We hope to provide a mutually beneficial relationship, where Vyrb takes a reasonable fee on the transacting of these parties in exchange for bringing them together.

Competition
 
The smart eyewear industry in which we operate is competitive and subject to changes in practice. While we believe that our products are hybrid of eyeglasses and audio technology, which gives us a unique product that provides us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from many different entities now and in the future. As of now, we face competition from the following products:

● | Bose Corporation’s Bose Frames. These are a Bluetooth eyewear product, but in a bulkier form factor and with what we believe to be comparable models at a higher list price ($249 MSRP) than Lucyd Lyte 2.0 ($199).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amazon’s Echo Glasses. Another entry in the Bluetooth eyewear space offered at a $249 list price. Not available directly from the manufacturer in prescription, and in only one frame shape. The cost of the Amazon Echo Glasses is higher than Lucyd Lyte. While lightweight like Lucyd Lyte glasses, Amazon Echo Glasses have, in our view, a less fashionable form factor, and the battery life is about half of that of Lucyd Lyte.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Snapchat Spectacles. This is a camera-focused smart eyewear product and, in our view, not a direct competitor as to its style, weight, pricing and suitability for all-day wear, as compared with our products; however, Snapchat Spectacles may introduce further entries in the space that may directly compete with Lucyd Lyte. Snapchat Spectacles Version 3 have a list price of $380.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ray-Ban Stories Glasses. Developed in association with Facebook, are a camera-focused smart eyewear product, and despite the fact they are available in prescription, in our view not a direct competitor; Ray-Ban may, however, introduce further entries in the space that may directly compete with Lucyd Lyte. Ray-Ban Spectacles have a well-known and respected brand, and a list price starting at $299, which makes them 50% more expensive than Lucyd Lyte. They weigh considerably more (20-70% depending upon the Lyte model) than Lucyd Lyte glasses, have a shorter battery life, thicker temple profiles and are not water resistant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of the competitors discussed above have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. As a result, although we believe our products are currently superior, our competitors may be able to develop superior products, and compete more aggressively and sustain their competitive advantage over a longer period of time than us. Our products may be rendered obsolete in the face of competition.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 9 full time employees with two in product development, two in sales, one in finance, one in customer service, one in marketing, one in graphic design and one in video production. Employees are supported by a number of consultants and part time employees, including a group of 8 independent sales representatives.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We rely heavily on our information technology systems, as well as those of our third-party vendors, business partners, and service providers, for our business to effectively operate and to safeguard confidential information; any significant failure, inadequacy, interruption, or data security incident could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our multichannel channel business faces distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage it could have a negative impact on our profitability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
18

 


● | If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs or requirements, our solutions may become less competitive.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A decline in sales of our eyewear would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Failure to adequately maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may incur costs to defend against, face liability or for being vulnerable to intellectual property infringement claims brought against us by others.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
 

● | We face risks associated with suppliers from whom our products are sourced and are dependent on a limited number of suppliers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our projects could be hindered due to our dependence on third parties to complete many of our contracts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We depend on search engines, social media platforms, digital application stores, content-based online advertising, and other online sources to attract consumers to and promote our website and our mobile applications, which may be affected by third-party interference beyond our control; and, as we grow, the cost of acquiring new customers may continue to rise and become uneconomical.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to Our Common Stock
 

● | Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.
