ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
Lode-Star Mining Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A., on December 9, 2004. The Companys principal executive offices are in Reno, Nevada. The Company was originally formed to acquire exploration stage natural resource properties.
 
On January 14, 2022, the Company formally returned its 20% undivided interest in the Goldfield Bonanza Project to Lode Star Gold, Inc., the optionor of that property (LSG), pursuant to a settlement and termination agreement (the Settlement Agreement).
 
On December 28, 2021, the Company acquired from Sapir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Sapir), all of the assets used in connection with the proprietary stabilized formulation of the Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) molecule for further pharmaceutical development. On June 6, 2022, the Company and Sapir agreed to rescind the acquisition due to circumstances beyond either partys control. In connection with the rescission, the Company reinstated $2,246,146 in debt owed to LSG that was previously forgiven under the Settlement Agreement in order to facilitate the Sapir transaction.
 
On June 21, 2022 the Company, LSG and certain related party creditors agreed to convert an aggregate of $2,601,207 in debt owed to those parties into 70,302,906 shares of the Companys common stock at a price of $0.037 per share.
 
At present, the Company has no current business project and no cash generating operations. Management is actively seeking business opportunities.
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to establish a business and to obtain new financing to execute its business plan. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has had no revenue and has incurred accumulated losses of $4,263,323 as of December 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company is significantly dependent upon its ability and will continue to attempt to secure additional equity and/or debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. The financial statements have, in managements opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality.
 
The Company has implemented all applicable new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. Those pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed.
