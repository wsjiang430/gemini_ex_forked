Item 1. Business
Overview 
Life360 is a leading technology platform used to locate the people, pets and things that matter most to families. Life360 has created a new category at the intersection of family, technology, and safety to help keep families connected and safe. Our core offering, the Life360 mobile application, includes features that range from communications to driving safety and location sharing. The Life360 mobile application operates under a “freemium” model where its core offering is available to users at no charge, with three membership subscription options that are available but not required. 
We acquired Jiobit and Tile in September 2021 and January 2022, respectively, to create a comprehensive cross-platform location tracking solution for people, pets and things. Jiobit is a leading platform-agnostic wearable location device for young children, pets and seniors and Tile is a leading cross platform brand in finding objects. The suite of Life360 product and service offerings, including the Life360, Tile and Jiobit mobile applications, and related third-party services (the “Life360 Service”), is system and device agnostic, allowing our products and services to work seamlessly for families, regardless of the different platforms and devices that each family member may elect to use. 
Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of subscriptions and hardware tracking devices to access our services across our three brands - Life360, Tile and Jiobit. In addition, a portion of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was generated indirectly and is categorized as other revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Indirect revenue includes the sale of data insights from our member base and the sale of third-party products and services, including through targeted ads within our platform. For example, we generate revenue through the display of auto insurance products within the Life360 Platform. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 Life360 generated: 
•Total revenue of $228.3 million, $112.6 million, and $80.7 million respectively; and 
•Net loss of $91.6 million, $33.6 million, and $16.3 million, respectively. 
Our Growth Strategy
We plan to grow members in new and existing markets, increase monetization of our member base, and pursue disciplined expansion in new use cases, including entering new verticals. We also plan to remain a trusted brand and indispensable safety membership for families by continuing to offer a suite of safety services that span every life stage of the family. 
Our members are our best acquisition engine, and we believe that word-of-mouth referrals will continue to drive strong new member growth for Life360. We plan to drive further market penetration through increased investments in marketing and brand awareness, member acquisition initiatives, and the provision of new features in new and existing markets. Our primary strategy for subscriber conversion is to continue to invest in our product offering, provide the highest levels of member service and deepen our engagement with our member base. 
Our Products 
Life360 Subscription Offerings
The Life360 mobile application operates under a “freemium” model where the core offering is available to users at no charge. In addition, three paid membership subscription options are available for users looking for a wider variety of features, such as additional safety features for the everyday family: Life360 Silver, Life360 Gold, and Life360 Platinum, which offer users a comprehensive suite of premium safety services. Pricing for the paid memberships of the Life360 Platform currently ranges from $7.99 per month for Life360 Silver to $24.99 per month for Life360 Platinum.
Memberships are available in the United States and Canada. Outside of these two markets, Life360 offers the free membership and a single paid membership option, which is priced at $4.99 per month in local currency equivalent and offers place alerts, location history and individual driver reports. 
Life360 Platform 
We currently offer four key product features that combined make up the Life360 Platform: (i) location coordination and safety, (ii) driving safety, (iii) digital safety, and (iv) emergency assistance. Each of these features keeps members connected to the important people in their lives by organizing them into groups (“Circles”). A member selects who to invite to their Circle and what information a Circle, or any individual member within that Circle, receives. 
Location coordination and safety features include real-time location, location history and smart notifications such as location-specific alerts, driving alerts, crash alerts and crime reports. Driving safety features include crash detection, roadside assistance, family driving summaries and individual driver reports. Digital safety features include data breach alerts, identity theft protection, stolen funds reimbursement and credit monitoring. Emergency assistance features include SOS with emergency dispatch, disaster response, medical assistance and travel support. 
Tile Product Line
Tile branded hardware tracking devices come in various shapes, sizes and price points for different use cases. The Tile network leverages the Life360 member base, generating even higher confidence that we can locate lost devices of Tile customers. Tile devices are sold through online and brick and mortar retail channels as well as directly via Tile.com. Single Tile devices’ recommended retail prices range from $14.99 to $34.99 with additional bundles at higher price points. Tile devices are also available internationally at locally relevant prices. 
Tile Subscription Offerings
The Tile mobile application offers a free service as well as two paid subscription options: Premium and Premium Protect, which offers additional services such as warranties and item reimbursement. 
Jiobit Product Line
The Jiobit product line offers wearable location devices for young children, pets, and seniors. Currently, Jiobit is offered exclusively in the United States via online retailers and brick and mortar retail channels. Customers purchase a Jiobit device at the current retail price of $129.99 and a monthly subscription to access Jiobit location tracking services. 
Jiobit Subscription Offerings
The Jiobit device requires a monthly subscription plan to stay connected to the Jiobit services. Subscription prices vary based on the duration of the contract and range from $8.99 per month with a two-year commitment to $14.99 per month with no commitment. Monthly contracts offer features such as location history, SOS notifications, and access to the Jiobit desktop portal. Paid subscriptions are available for either $8.99 per month or $14.99 per month, depending on the subscription term.
Our Technology Platform 
To help families stay connected and safe, we have developed a scalable mobile-first technology platform that supports our business while protecting our operational integrity, security and performance. Highlights of our technology platform include a robust location engine design, scalable and modern technology infrastructure, and seamless third-party integration.
Location Engine Design 
We have designed an end-to-end location technology solution that allows us to deliver real-time location-based experiences and includes functionality such as storage, processing and communication of events, locations, drives, maps, places, networking and visualization of device characteristics for people, pets and things. 
We utilize third-party services for our backend platform and infrastructure to connect to our apps and custom hardware devices. Using these services grants us access to a highly distributed, scalable, reliable and secure architecture for global delivery. 
Third-Party Integration 
To extend the features and functionality of our platform, we integrate third-party software into our products where applicable. Our platform seamlessly integrates with our partnership offerings with several software-as-a-service vendors. This enhances our offerings with capabilities and features such as contextual auto insurance ads, identity theft protection, data breach alerts, and voice service integrations. The Tile finding network, which allows Tile users to locate their devices via the Tile app, has been integrated into the Life360 Platform. This integration allows members and Circles to keep track of their things and connect with each other through one seamless Life360 Platform. 
Competition 
Our competitors include both large competitors with various product and service offerings and smaller competitors, including (i) direct competitors with location sharing products that target family safety, (ii) competitors providing location sharing platforms that are not focused on family safety, (iii) competitors in the item tracking technology market and (iv) competitors that have, or may in the future have, overlapping offerings (for example, companies in industries related to roadside assistance and crash detection, identity theft protection, phone insurance and travel, disaster and medical assistance). 
While our industry is becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that we will continue to compete successfully due to our leading market position, superior value proposition, brand recognition, ability to leverage our member base, our comprehensive suite of offerings and economies of scale. In addition, our data-driven insights on families’ habits, needs and preferences enable us to continuously enhance our product offerings and improve the member experience, reinforcing our competitive differentiation. 
Employees and Culture 
Life360’s core values are designed to create a culture that supports our vision of an ambitious, professionally driven organization that can simplify safety so families can live fully: 
•Be a Good Person. Everyone at Life360 respects each other and maintains a high level of integrity. 
•Be Direct with Respect. We communicate directly, even when it’s hard. This is always done in support of the other person’s development, and we are intentionally inclusive and always respectful. 
•Members Over Metrics. We value metrics and use them to influence strategy and measure results, but at our core we always focus on building an exceptional experience for families. 
•High Intensity, High Impact. We do whatever it takes to get the job done. We are in a fast moving and competitive environment and we have a team that is in it to win it. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 400 full-time employees and approximately 200 contractors, all of whom have the flexibility to work remotely or out of our San Mateo and Chicago offices. Life360 aims to provide a work environment in which all of our people can excel regardless of race, religion, age, disability, gender, sexual preference or marital status. Our Diversity Policy reflects a strong commitment to diversity, and a recognition of the value of attracting people with different backgrounds, knowledge, experience and abilities. We believe that diversity contributes to our business success, and benefits all of our stakeholders. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 37% of Life360 employees were female and 49% were people of color. We are committed to implementing further initiatives to increase the diversity of our workforce. 
We view the quality of our products and services as our key long-term strategic differentiator, and as such, we are committed to providing continuous learning and development opportunities for our people. We provide peer training, including our standing Thursday “deep-dives” where our people can learn from the expertise of their colleagues. We also provide full day and full week-long courses in “best practices” and broad and specialist business training to further promote personal and professional growth. 
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance 
Our core mission is the social good of simplifying safety for families through ESG initiatives based on four key areas: people, environment, community and governance. 
People 
We believe that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds create a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better results. Together, we continue to build an inclusive culture that encourages, supports, and celebrates the diverse voices of our employees. This fuels our innovation and connects us closer to our customers and the communities we serve. We strive to create a workplace that reflects the communities we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their authentic best selves to work. Our workplace culture is supported by a range of policies adopted by our Board of Directors (our “Board”) that reflect our beliefs, including a Diversity Policy. 
Environment 
We recognize that climate change will have an increasingly significant impact on all aspects of society. In 2021, we committed to quantifying the environmental footprint of our business operations by measuring the following emissions: direct greenhouse emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by us (“Scope 1 Emissions”), indirect greenhouse emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat or cooling (“Scope 2 Emissions”) and results of activities from assets not owned or controlled by us, but that indirectly impact our value chain (“Scope 3 Emissions”). By quantifying our impact, we will be able to implement an emission reduction plan that targets the greatest contributors to our carbon footprint. 
We achieved carbon neutrality across Scope 1, 2, and 3 Emissions for calendar years 2021 and 2020. We are in the process of finalizing the reporting of Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions for the 2022 calendar year. We achieved a carbon neutral status for the 2021 and 2020 calendar years by purchasing EcoAustralia credits that blend InfraVest Guanyin Wind carbon credits with Mount Sandy Conservation biodiversity protection units. By purchasing EcoAustralia credits, we neutralize our emissions and promote conservation partnerships between traditional landowners and non-indigenous Australians. Carbon neutral is a term used to describe when the greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere by an organization over a certain time period, for example, calendar year, are negated through the purchase and retirement of carbon offsets.
Community 
We aim to simplify safety so families can live fully. Our products and services deliver peace of mind and safety in the online and physical worlds. Additionally, we engage in community outreach by supporting and matching employee contributions to three non-profit organizations committed to supporting families: the Make-a-Wish Foundation, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Team Rubicon. 
Governance 
We are committed to robust governance frameworks and responsible business practices to ensure the financial sustainability of the Company for all stakeholders including shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers. We have established a disciplined process to identify, assess and analyze risk, and ensure appropriate risk monitoring and reporting. 
Our 2021 and 2020 calendar year ESG reports are available at https://investors.life360.com/investor-relations, which is provided for reference only and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our 2022 calendar year ESG report will be available on March 31, 2023. 
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our customer offerings and competitiveness. Our global research and development team supports the design and development of our location sharing services, mobile app development, web development, firmware development, platform software development, site reliability engineering, hardware engineering, test engineering and data science and analytics. Our research and development expenses were $102.5 million, $51.0 million and $39.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to bring new customer experiences and devices to market and expand our platform capabilities. 
Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment 
We outsource the manufacturing of our Tile and Jiobit products to our contract manufacturer, Jabil, located in Asia. Jabil has been designated the sole contract manufacturer for Tile and primary manufacturer for Jiobit since the inception of both companies. Jiobit utilizes additional contract manufacturers for additional accessory production. To continue to provide our members with quality technology, our supply chain teams in the United States and Asia coordinate the relationships between our contract manufacturer and suppliers. In order to mitigate risks associated with a single supply source, and to ensure we can scale our manufacturing base as we continue to expand, we routinely evaluate new partners, manufacturers and suppliers. 
Tile entered into a manufacturing agreement with Jabil on March 8, 2017, for an initial term of five years. Under our agreement with Jabil, Jabil manufactures our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish. We additionally grant Jabil a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable right and license to use certain Tile intellectual property as it relates to Jabil’s obligations under the agreement. We pay for and own the majority of tooling and other equipment specifically required to manufacture our products. We have purchase commitments based on our purchase orders and demand forecasts for certain amounts of finished goods, works-in-progress, and components purchased in order to support such purchase orders and forecasts. Under the terms of the agreement, the agreement may be terminated (i) by mutual written consent, (ii) by advanced written notice from either party, (iii) for cause by either party after written notice of a material breach and failure by the other party to cure such breach within thirty days or (iv) immediately upon written notice by either party upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. 
Our agreement with Jabil expired in March 2022. We are currently in the process of renewing our agreement. Jabil has provided us with written confirmation of its intention to continue our relationship on the same terms as our original manufacturing agreement, and to enter into a new agreement with us on similar terms. 
We also work with third-party fulfillment partners that package and deliver our products to multiple locations worldwide, which allows us to reduce order fulfillment time and shipping costs, as well as improve inventory flexibility. Our partner relationships help us maintain access to the resources needed to scale seasonally.
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property is an integral aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property and technological innovations as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of federal, state, and common-law rights in the United States and the rights under the laws of other countries, patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain name, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements with third parties, employee confidentiality, and proprietary rights agreements, and other contractual rights, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
We have developed and acquired patent assets to protect our proprietary technology. Individual patents have terms for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States, and in many foreign countries, are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application (14 or 15 years from the date of grant for U.S. design patents) provided their registrations are properly maintained. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We also pursue the registration of certain of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or that it will provide any competitive advantage. Further, in some foreign countries, the mechanisms to establish and enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology. To protect our brand, as of December 31, 2022, we owned a trademark portfolio comprising U.S. registered trademarks including our primary mark “Life360” and various versions of the Life360 logo, in addition to other Life360 word marks and logos, as well as registered and pending trademarks for our “Tile” and “Jiobit” marks in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Trademark registrations can generally be renewed as long as the marks are in use. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further protect the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions. For information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property.” 
Seasonality 
Life360 subscriptions have historically experienced member and subscription growth seasonality in the third quarter of each calendar year, which includes the return to school for many of our members. Hardware sales have historically experienced revenue seasonality in the fourth quarter of each calendar year, which includes the important selling periods in November (Black Friday and Cyber Monday) and December (Christmas and Hanukkah) in large part due to seasonal holiday demand. 
Facilities 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company leased real estate space under non-cancellable operating lease agreements in San Francisco, San Diego and San Mateo, California and Chicago, Illinois. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had terminated the operating lease agreements in San Francisco and San Diego, California and relocated its corporate headquarters to San Mateo, California. Our offices in San Mateo and Chicago generally accommodate principal, development, engineering, marketing and administrative activities. Beginning in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we began operating as a remote-first company with plans to continue as such indefinitely. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations. 
Government Regulation 
Our Company is subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These include laws and regulations that relate to data privacy, security, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), content regulation, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, competition, protection of children and minors, consumer protection, payment processing, subscription services, taxation, health and safety, employment and labor and telecommunications. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and being tested in courts and by regulators and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Additionally, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, especially in new or rapidly evolving industries, and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country or state to state and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business. 
Additionally, our service providers are also subject to domestic and international laws and regulations. Our business depends on certain products and services, including those delivered via internet, from these third parties. The uncertainty in the regulations and interpretation and application of such regulations in the third-party industries may result in an increase in our own expenses or adversely affect our business. 
The costs of complying with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are high and likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows, and our geographic scope and data processing activities expand. Furthermore, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. It is imperative that we secure the assets, functionality, materials and member data that are critical to our business. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Further, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all our products for an extended period of time or indefinitely. 
For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Legal Matters and Our Regulatory Environment.” 
Government Regulation of Data Privacy and Security 
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal or other sensitive data. Accordingly, we are or may become subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM”), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), the Age Appropriate Design Code enacted by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “ePrivacy Directive”), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). Several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. Additionally, we are or may become subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures to third parties). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, expands the CCPA. For example, the CPRA gives California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establishes restrictions on personal data retention, expands the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.
Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
For additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Privacy and Cybersecurity.”

We make available on our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding our filings at www.sec.gov. Additionally, the Company routinely posts additional important information, including press releases, on its website and recognizes its website as a channel of distribution to reach public investors and as a means of disclosing material non-public information for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our website in addition to our SEC filings and public webcasts. These items are available at investors.life360.com under “Results and reports”.

Jurisdiction of Incorporation
The Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware, United States of America, and is a registered foreign entity in Australia. As a foreign Company registered in Australia, the Company is subject to different reporting and regulatory regimes than Australian companies.
Delaware Law, Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
As a foreign Company registered in Australia, the Company is not subject to Chapters 6, 6A, 6B and 6C of the Corporations Act dealing with the acquisition of shares (including substantial shareholdings and takeovers). 
Under the provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), shares are freely transferable and subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. federal or state securities laws, by the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended (“Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) or bylaws (“Bylaws”), or by an agreement signed with the holders of the shares at issuance. The Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws do not impose any specific restrictions on transfer. However, provisions of the DGCL, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and the Company’s Bylaws could make it more difficult to acquire the Company by means of a tender offer (takeover), a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent officers and Directors of the Company. These provisions could discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and takeover bids that the Board may consider inadequate and encourage persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to first negotiate with the Board. 
The Company believes that the benefits of increased protection of its ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure the Company outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.
Life360’s CDIs are issued in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) for offers of securities which are made outside the U.S. Accordingly, the CDIs, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the laws of any state or other jurisdiction in the U.S. As a result of relying on the exemption pursuant to Regulation S, the CDIs are ‘restricted securities’ under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This means that the CDIs cannot be sold into the U.S. or to a U.S. person who is not a Qualified Institutional Buyer (as defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act, a ‘QIB’) for the foreseeable future except in very limited circumstances until after the end of the restricted period, unless the re-sale of the CDIs is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption is available. To enforce the transfer restrictions, all CDIs issued bear a FOR Financial Product designation on the ASX. This designation restricts any CDIs from being sold on the ASX to U.S. persons excluding QIBs. CDIs may be transferred on ASX to any person other than a U.S. person who is not a QIB. Hedging transactions with regard to the CDIs may only be conducted in accordance with the Securities Act.
