A New Operating System for Roadways
 
The condition of national transportation infrastructure systems is a matter of great concern, particularly in the United States.
 
As the private sector continues to innovate and make headlines with cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous vehicles, flying taxis, and smart delivery drones, it's paradoxical that essential issues such as roadway congestion, safety, vehicle emissions and equitable access are worsening at an alarming rate. So much so that on February 2, 2023, the US Department of Transportation declared a national crisis and state of emergency for roadway safety and launched an urgent roadway safety call-to-action demanding stakeholders to commit to specific actions to reverse the spike in serious injuries and deaths on our roadways.
 
According to a report from the American Society of Civil Engineers ("ASCE"), US infrastructure has been graded a C minus, indicating that there is significant and urgent need for improvement. Over 65% of the 4.3 million miles of US roadways are rated in poor condition, which impacts the safety of drivers and passengers. The issue of congestion is also a serious concern, estimated to cost US citizens a whopping $120 billion per year in economic and productivity losses. Furthermore, transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions – motorists' emissions, particularly when trapped in traffic account for a significant proportion of the country's total emissions are a leading contributor to declining sustainability, which has far-reaching environmental impacts. Addressing the road infrastructure issue is imperative for both economic and ecological reasons. Last but not least, tragically, more than 43,000 people lose their lives each year while using the nation's transportation network of streets, roads, and highways, which represents a stark failure in public safety and policy. If these transportation network issues remain unaddressed, it is projected that the United States will face a $10 trillion gap in its gross domestic product.
 
To address urgent transportation issues and ensure the competitiveness of the US economy, an unprecedented amount of funding has been made available from the federal government through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA"), Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act to create digitally-enabled transportation infrastructure that will provide public goods and new economic value. This represents a once-in-a-generation level of investment and bipartisan support for creating and scaling transportation digital infrastructure for the 21st century. Rather than a complete reset or rebuilding of infrastructure, the focus is rather to leverage their power of funding and policymaking to build on previous investments, promote new technology layers, and ensure universal access to digital infrastructure systems throughout the country.
 
The ultimate objective is to adopt an augmented approach to existing physical infrastructure that blends the strengths of physical, digital, and operational infrastructure with mobility data, including mobile phones, connected vehicles, roadway sensors, and more. The goal is to enable and coordinate private and public collaboration through a digital-enabled mobility internet and operating system for the roadways that will advance smarter, safer, greener roadways for all.
 
This is a unique moment for Rekor, and one that we have been preparing for since 2018.

To lead in this highly competitive industry, we must innovate and deliver new, groundbreaking products and services that set us apart from the competition. Our ability to efficiently collect massive amounts of data from existing infrastructure, combine it with third-party data sets, and process and transform this data into actionable insights using advanced AI and data analytical tools gives us a competitive edge. We also excel by providing tailored datasets and integrated solutions and workflows to multiple agencies through a single platform, allowing us to meet the unique needs of various markets. 
 
Our unique approach allows us to collect vehicle classification, counts and speed across all FHWA13 classes. We also provide deeper classification for both traditional vehicles, connected vehicles, hybrid-electric vehicles, and can report on the interactions of these modes of transport with non-motorized roadway users – including bicycles and pedestrians. In the transportation management sector, these data collection and analysis abilities differentiate our results from others in the market.  In addition, we have the ability to accomplish this data collection without intruding on the roadway, which presents a leapfrog opportunity for us to gain and accelerate market segment share because of the serious concerns that our customers have for human safety. We believe that we can sustain our success in the roadway intelligence market because we have developed groundbreaking, innovative offerings that surpass the high standards set by established industry leaders. To penetrate these established markets, we must challenge the status quo, drive the evolution of industry standards, and deliver superior price and performance characteristics.
 
Although we were an early leader in the successful application of AI to vehicle recognition and continue to see significant potential for innovative applications of AI in the roadway intelligence area, we do not see the use of AI itself as a proprietary advantage. Rather our early start in using AI and machine learning to develop vehicle recognition and roadway data analysis algorithms for a diverse customer base has allowed us to maintain a lead over others who have had access to the same non-proprietary AI and machine learning techniques but have not used it as early or as widely as we have. As we increase our footprint in the industry, we preserve this advantage. However, the roadway is constantly changing with the introduction of new models and types of vehicles, as well as other modifications, such as plate designs. In order to minimize potential threats from others seeking to match our performance or undercut our prices, we must remain committed to delivering differentiated, unique solutions that provide greater value and benefits to our customers. Where we have developed proprietary technologies, such as our unique edge processing and privacy filter technologies, we will take decisive action to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights. However, it will be through our unyielding pursuit of innovation and quality that we will establish ourselves as a leader in the industry. To maintain our competitive edge, we are required to prioritize key factors such as design innovation, security and privacy features, product quality and reliability, and exceptional service and support.
 
We face intense competition in the transportation and public safety markets, pitted against rival companies with significant technical, marketing, distribution, and resource advantages, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings. Furthermore, several competitors possess a larger installed base of active devices, making the competition even more fierce. By providing a comprehensive set of solutions across a wide range of use cases, however, we feel that we can stand apart from most of our competitors, who only operate in a narrow segment of the market. We are concentrating on providing data resources that are more reliable, efficient and readily available. This includes upgrading existing infrastructure to efficiently collect reliable data, aggregating that data with third-party data, processing the data with superior analytical tools, and delivering datasets and actionable insights tailored to the specific needs of multiple agencies through a single platform. Throughout the development of our products and platforms, we have paid particular attention to network and data processing efficiency to allow results to be distributed more effectively through existing communications networks. By facilitating a variety of modular upgrades to existing infrastructure, combining data from various sources, and providing valuable real-time, historical, and predictive insights, Rekor can continue to deliver solutions that meet the needs of customers across the value chain.

Marketing and Sales
 
We offer product and services in multiple markets, using direct sales, an eCommerce platform and extensive partnerships and alliances. Our direct sales force is organized into groups aligned to the Intelligent Traffic Systems (“ITS”) chapters and other targeted market segments, with a primary focus on direct-to-end-user sales through a high-touch consultative process. In addition, we have established partnerships and strategic alliances that allow us to bundle our technology into purpose-built solutions for various national and global market segments.
 
As we continue to increase our roadway intelligence engagement with national, state and municipal DOTs, we remain focused on law enforcement communities – both directly and indirectly through strategic partners and resellers/integrators. Our market-leading solutions provide significant value to DOTs for traffic management, planning and operations, and to municipal planning organizations for urban mobility.  In addition to these agencies, our solutions also enable law enforcement, intelligence-based policing, corporate campus security, and regulatory compliance for public security. Our technology enables us to understand vehicle characteristics and behaviors beyond simple license plate capture, and digital vehicle signatures – extending into traffic analytics, sustainability metrics, and weigh-in-motion studies for motorized as well as non-motorized movements, such as bicycles and pedestrians.  In 2023, we will be working to extend our reach into smaller communities as we continue to serve medium-large DOT and law enforcement departments with our direct sales representatives.
 
Given that our primary market is state and local governments in the United States, the majority of our sales efforts involve a request for proposal process and/or grant application process. In 2023, we will continue to capture and submit proposals and apply for grants, while also seeking opportunities to submit concurrently with strategic partners.
 
Our eCommerce platform offers businesses and individuals around the world a convenient way to purchase our high-value vehicle recognition solutions with just a credit card and a click. The platform allows for self-service sign-up and a range of subscription options while also funneling customers directly to our sales support team if they need more information. We recently launched our Edge Pro camera system, our first hardware device for sale directly through the eCommerce platform. With our ALPR software preloaded, customers can activate AI-based vehicle recognition services through a subscription online or by telephone. The device is shipped globally, with optional enhancements for solar power and various pole configurations.

Should our penetration of tolling and other markets involving per recognition fees expand, we would expect to become more subject to seasonal traffic patterns.
Insurance and Risk Management
 
We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury, property and economic loss. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles, and reserves to be adequate. Whenever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety, and other similar methods.
 
Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach for fixed-price contracts and our project execution process. We also evaluate risk through internal risk analyses in which our management reviews higher-risk projects, contracts, or other business decisions that require corporate legal and risk management approval.
 
Regulation
 
We are regulated in some of the fields in which we operate. When working with governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things may require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations. We are subject to the laws and regulations that restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes.
 
To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
