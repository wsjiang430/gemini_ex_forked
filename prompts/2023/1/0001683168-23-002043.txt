ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Nocera, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 1, 2002, with operations based in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Our primary business operations currently consist of designing, developing and producing large scale recirculating aquaculture systems (“RASs”) for fish farms along with providing consulting, technology transfer and aquaculture project management services to new and existing aquaculture management business services.
 
RASs operate by filtering water from the fish (or shellfish) tanks so it can be reused within the tank. This dramatically reduces the amount of water and space required to intensively produce seafood products. The steps in RASs include solids removal, ammonia removal, Co2 removal and oxygenation. Prior to 2021, we initially focused on the Chinese market due to opportunities presented by changes to regulations governing water use for fish production in China. As of October 2020, we had delivered 551 fish tank systems to six separate Chinese-based fish farms, and two fish tank systems to our Taiwan showroom.
 
In October 2020, the government of Taiwan began supporting the Green Power and Solar Sharing Fish Farms initiative. In view of the opportunities resulting from this initiative, in October 2020, we ceased all of our operations in China and moved all of our technology and back-office operations to Taiwan. We now only operate out of Taiwan.
 
Our current mission is to provide consulting services and solutions in aquaculture projects to reduce water pollution and decrease the disease problems of fisheries. Our goal is to become a global leader in the land-based aquaculture business. We are now poised to grow our existing operations in Taiwan and expand into the development and management of land-based fish farms in Taiwan and North and South America. We do not currently have any intentions of conducting operations in China or Hong Kong.
 Corporate History
 
Nocera, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 1, 2002, and is based in New Taipei City, Taiwan.
 
Reverse Merger
 
Effective December 31, 2018, we completed a reverse merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) with (i) GSI, (ii) GSI’s stockholders, Yin-Chieh (“Jeff”) Cheng and Zhang Bi, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of GSI (the “GSI Shares”) and (iii) GSI Acquisition Corp. Under the terms of the Agreement, the GSI Stockholders transferred to us all of the GSI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 6,666,667 (post-split) shares of our common stock. As a result of the reverse merger, GSI became our wholly-owned subsidiary and Mr. Cheng and Zhang Bi, the former stockholders of GSI, became our controlling stockholders. The share exchange transaction with GSI was treated as a reverse merger, with GSI as the accounting acquirer and Nocera as the acquired party. GSI is a limited company established under the laws and regulations of Hong Kong on August 1, 2014 and is a holding company without any assets or operations.
 
In anticipation of the reverse merger, GSI undertook a reorganization and became the 100% holding company of Guizhou Grand Smooth Technology Ltd (“GZ GST”) and GSI Guizhou Wan Feng Hu Intelligent Aquatic Technology Co. Limited (“GZ WFH”), which were all controlled by the same stockholders before and after the reorganization, pursuant to a series of contractual agreements (the “GZ WFH VIE Agreements”). As a result, GSI, through GZ GST, was determined to be the primary beneficiary of GZ WFH and GZ WFH became a variable interest entity (“VIE”) of GSI. Accordingly, GSI consolidated GZ WFH’s operations, assets and liabilities.
 
GZ WFH was incorporated in Xingyi City, Guizhou Province, People’s Republic of China (PRC) on October 25, 2017, and was engaged in providing fish farming containers service, which integrated sales, installments, and maintenance of aquaculture equipment.

Divestiture of GZ WFH 
 
On September 21, 2020, we terminated our relationship with GZ WFH and its management, and the GZ WFH Agreements between the parties were terminated as well.
 
Subsequently on October 8, 2020, Zhang Bi and GZ WFH entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with us wherein all claims as to GZ WFH’s debt (claim to our shares or GZ GST) were compromised, settled, and otherwise resolved as to any and all claims or causes of action whatsoever against us for any matter, action, or representation as to Nocera, and any debt to ownership of Nocera or GZ GST up to the date of the settlement agreement. The consideration for the settlement agreement was mutual waiver of any and all claims against each other and GZ GST, and GZ WFH (including Zhang Bi) waived any claims to our stock, and the 3,166,667 (post-split) shares of our common stock owned by Zhang Bi were cancelled.
 
XFC Sale
 
On December 31, 2020, we exchanged 466,667 (post-split) shares of our restricted common stock to stockholders of Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd., a Taiwan limited liability company (“XFC”), in exchange for 100% controlling interest in XFC. We also entered into contractual arrangements with a stockholder of XFC, that enabled us to have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affects the economic performance of XFC and receive the economic benefits of XFC that could be significant to XFC. On November 30, 2022, we entered into a Purchase of Business Agreement with Han-Chieh Shih (the “Purchaser”), in which we sold our controlling interest of XFC, to the Purchaser for a total purchase cash price of $300,000 (the “XFC Sale”). The closing of the XFC Sale occurred on November 30, 2022 and the XFC variable interest entity (“VIE”) agreements were terminated in connection with the XFC Sale.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On July 26, 2022, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to implement a 2-for-3 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock, with fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split being rounded up to the nearest whole number. The reverse stock split was effected on August 11, 2022.
 
The VIE Agreements with Meixin
 
On September 7, 2022, we entered into a series of contractual agreements (collectively, the “Meixin VIE Agreements”) with the majority stockholder (the “Selling Stockholder”) of Meixin Institutional Food Development Co., Ltd., a Taiwan corporation and a food processing and catering company (“Meixin”), and Meixin, of which we purchased 80% controlling interest of Meixin for $4,300,000. The Meixin VIE Agreements essentially confer control and management of Meixin as well as substantially all of the economic benefits of the Selling Stockholder in Meixin to us.
 
Business Developments
 
The following highlights recent material developments in our business:
 

· | On September 19, 2022, we announced that our seafood porridge bowl will be launched at the Ning Xia Night Market in the Datong District of Taipei City, Taiwan with a soft opening on September 26, 2022. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | On November 17, 2022, we announced that we achieved eel sales revenue of over $3 million for the month of October 2022. 
· | On December 13, 2022, we announced that we achieved eel sales revenue of approximately $3.2 million for the month of November 2022.

Recent Developments
 
Recent developments of the Company are summarized below and have been previously disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC:
 

· | On September 8, 2022, we entered into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement with an unaffiliated third party pursuant to which we agreed to purchase 229 contiguous acres of land located in Montgomery County, Alabama (the “Land Acquisition”). We paid an earnest deposit of $10,000 on the land with the balance of $865,000 payable at closing. We borrowed $650,000 to fund the purchase price. The Land Acquisition closed on February 16, 2023. We intend to build RASs on the land for fish farming. The property includes a house, a manufactured home and a building site with sewer and power which we intend to develop into an office and dormitory for our future employees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corporate Structure
 
We conduct our operations through (i) Meixin; and (ii) Nocera Taiwan Branch, an unincorporated division of the Company (“NTB”). Our other subsidiaries, GSI, which wholly-owns GZ GST, are dormant and currently do not have any operations. However, GZ GST may be involved with RASs manufacturing in the near future.
 
We acquired GSI in a reverse merger on December 31, 2018. Prior to the merger, we were a “shell company” as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act). GSI is the parent holding company of GZ GST, which was incorporated on November 13, 2018, as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in the PRC. Both GSI and GZ GZT are currently dormant and do not conduct any operations. We currently do not conduct any operations in China or Hong Kong.
 
In December 2020, we added XFC as a VIE in order to obtain a Class A construction license to construct indoor RASs and solar sharing fish farms. On November 30, 2022, we entered into a Purchase of Business Agreement with Han-Chieh Shih, in which we sold our controlling interest of XFC, to the Purchaser for a total purchase cash price of $300,000. The closing of the XFC Sale occurred on November 30, 2022 and the XFC VIE agreements were terminated in connection with the XFC Sale. As of November 30, 2022, we ceased providing services to construct indoor RASs and solar sharing fish farms in Taiwan.
 
On September 7, 2022, we entered into a series of contractual agreements with the majority stockholder of Meixin and Meixin, of which we purchased 80% controlling interest of Meixin for $4,300,000. The Meixin VIE Agreements essentially confer control and management of Meixin as well as substantially all of the economic benefits of the Selling Stockholder in Meixin to us. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 810 “Consolidation,” we are considered the primary beneficiary of Meixin and have consolidated Meixin’s assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
NTB was established on January 14, 2021 in Taiwan. In October 2021, Nocera began its eel trading business in response to domestic demands created by the COVID-19 lockdown. NTB currently procures and sells eel in Taiwan and plans to trade other types of seafood, such as tilapia and milkfish, in the near future. 
 
Significant Products & Services
 
We manufacture, sell, and install RASs for land-based fish farms. Originally, our systems were designed and constructed from used marine shipping containers. We then developed our next generation of RASs, a cylindrical shaped tank that holds approximately 15,000 U.S. gallons of water, which we believe make them among the largest systems in the market.
 
There are several significant benefits to our RASs:
 

· | the system provides a controlled and “traceable” environment; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the recirculating aquaculture system can be installed almost anywhere and requires minimal site preparation; and 
· | it benefits local economies by providing fresher and, therefore, generally healthier fish.

Nocera Recirculating Aquaculture System 
 

Market Overview
 
Global fish consumption has long been on the rise at a rate higher than any other source of animal protein, and the trend is expected to continue. With overfishing already threatening the earth’s marine ecosystem, it is anticipated that a significantly larger proportion of fish consumption would be farm-raised instead of wild-caught in the future.
 
Also, the trade conflict between the U.S. and China has led to a greater demand for non-Chinese origin seafood products from the U.S. market.
 
On a broader perspective, as the world rapidly begins a transition towards net zero carbon emissions in response to the ever-more pressing threat of climate change, it is foreseeable that solar energy will be the go-to option for many countries as a new source of green energy.
 
We believe that the RASs, with its proven advantage in producing more fish in a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner while offering greater location flexibility and the potential for a “solar-fish sharing mode,” is a perfect solution to address the opportunities highlighted above.

Consulting Services
 
We also provide consulting services and solutions for aquaculture projects, where we offer design innovation and RAS expertise to increase revenue, while decreasing operating expenses, allowing clients to operate more efficiently while increasing production. Additionally, we show clients how to operate more strategically by diversifying the species of fish raised to meet market demands. Our equipment enhances the management of fish farms by reducing the incidence of disease among the fish populations, while reducing water pollution from inland fish farms. We currently provide such services in Taiwan and intend to expand into other international markets and the United States to increase revenues and operate more efficiently.
 
We plan to provide the following service offerings:
 

· | for qualified investors or investment groups who are interested in capitalizing on the potential of the aquaculture industry and want to develop or take part in commercial fish farming or shrimp farming but lack the experience, design, installation, build and management of aquaculture projects to meet these interests; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a full range of pilot and management services to aquaculture companies and new aquaculture projects throughout Taiwan and potentially the rest of the world, providing tailored solutions to meet customer needs and to fulfill our commitment, to encourage and support clean water and clean fish products from the fish farm to the table; and 
· | select equipment and materials from suppliers to provide unique service offerings structured to generate higher profit margins. 

Strategy
 
We plan to focus on countries with a growing population and growing demand for food. By 2050, we will need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s growing population.1 There is a growing need for new ways to produce high-quality local fish without putting more pressure on our natural ecosystems. Like Taiwan, there are also many countries with a growing population and growing demand for high-protein food. We plan to go global through building demo sites promoting our RASs and selling our price-competitive systems in these countries to meet their demand for food and to satisfy their desire for a greener environment.
 
In January 2021, we moved our operation and market focus from China to Taiwan. In 2021, we established a Nocera Taiwan Branch to focus on customers in a variety of sectors, such as individual investors, government supported or funded companies, and international customers. We have received interest from areas like Japan, Thailand, Jordan, South Africa and the United States.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net sales were approximately $16.3 million and approximately $9.9 million, respectively.
 
Construction Services
 
Prior to terminating the VIE agreements with XFC in connection with the XFC Sale, we were the only provider of RAS solar power energy sharing and construction services in Taiwan. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have no intention of providing services to construct indoor RASs and solar sharing fish farms in Taiwan.
Customers
 
In 2023, we intend to target customers in a variety of markets (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Jordan, South Africa and the United States), such as individual investors, government supported or funded companies and other types of international customers. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the net sales were approximately $16.3 million and approximately $9.9 million, respectively.

Suppliers
 
We intend to purchase raw materials and parts and equipment from third parties locally in Taiwan and build and sell them to customers. We are not directly involved in the production or manufacturing of readily available equipment, and we do not take a risk in the repair and maintenance of the equipment because of the manufacturer’s maintenance policy. We have identified and sourced multiple suppliers in Taiwan, and our relationships with suppliers are generally good. We expect that our suppliers will be able to meet the anticipated demand for our products in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our needs, particularly as we ramp up our expansion into the U.S. and other markets around the world.
Competition
 
The market for aquaculture projects and services is highly competitive. Many of the producers and sellers are large entities that have significantly greater resources than we have. We also compete with small suppliers which provide smaller alternative aquaculture solutions regionally but due to the size of our projects, we believe that we should have a better price point.
Trademarks and Patents
 
We do not own any trademarks or patents.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We intend to create a brand and by our creation of the brand, offer unique and better incentives to the consumers. Our target market is not only limited to the direct processing plants; instead, consumers will be informed about the uniqueness of the fish product, and the important health benefits of fish protein.
 
Further, we plan to increase the species selection and product form through the investment of the additional 500 tanks; among all we plan to build a hatchery system by collaborating with professionals to promote and maintain healthy, self-sustaining populations of fish and other aquatic species. We are aiming for the direct wholesale option, including live hauling, restaurants, supermarkets and specialty stores. As of December 2022, we sell our food items, including our signature seafood porridge bowl, through our flagship bento box store located at the Ning Xia Night Market in the Datong District of Taipei City, Taiwan. In addition to utilizing Meixin’s distribution channel, we will move towards online marketing as well to achieve a greater market share.
 
Manufacturing Operations
 
Currently, we manufacture RASs through our branch office in Taiwan and may manufacture RASs through our Chinese subsidiaries. Additionally, we provide consulting services regarding RAS technology transfer and aquaculture project management services to customers in Taiwan.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in Taiwan and throughout the world, including, without limitation, those related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility, competition, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
 
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to joint and several liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, or at sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or was legal at the time it occurred.

We are also subject to laws regulating consumer products in the jurisdictions in which we sell our products. In the United States for instance, certain of our products are subject to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Act, under which the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission may exclude products from the market that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, require repair, replacement or refund of products, impose fines for noncompliance with requirements and impose fines for failure to timely notify them of potential safety hazards.
 
Also, with respect to the potential sale of eel and any other seafood into the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FSMA was enacted in order to aid the effective prevention of food safety issues in the food supply. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program impacts how food is grown, packed, processed, shipped and imported into the United States and it governs compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. The FDA has finalized seven major rules to implement FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to make clear specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, and criminal sanctions, any of which could impact our results of operations.
 
In addition, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on the labels of food products.
 
Our operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation, including the registration and licensing of plants, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards, and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal, state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal, state, and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, cease and desist orders, injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.
 
We are subject to certain regulations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 
We are also subject to certain health and safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health, and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. 
 
Our business depends in part on environmental regulations and programs of Taiwan that promote cleaner water sources to restore clean water back to people. Our customers may be encouraged with incentives by the local governments relating to aquaculture investment. The approvals of land, licenses or permits, are required from relevant central and local government authorities. In addition, from time to time, relevant government authorities may impose new regulations at a local level regulating fish farming. We believe that we have skills to help our customers obtain all necessary licenses, registrations and permits to comply with all requirements necessary to allow our customers and investors to conduct aquaculture business in Taiwan.
 
Listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market
 
Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “NCRA” since August 11, 2022.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are currently not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened legal or administrative proceedings against us in all material aspects. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.

Property
 
We own 229 contiguous acres of land located in Montgomery County, Alabama up to the date of this report.
 
Seasonality
 
Since the global growing demand from aquaculture production along with the decreasing production from wild fisheries and our fish farming systems provide a controlled and traceable environment for species, our business rarely suffers a seasonal impact.
 Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 19 employees, including 16 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees. In addition, we have 9 consultants. We are compliant with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing, and have good relations with our employees.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our Company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
