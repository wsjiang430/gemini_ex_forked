The Airocide™ system of air purification technologies, originally developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) with assistance from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, uses a combination of UVC and a proprietary, titanium dioxide based photocatalyst to eliminate airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, viruses, volatile organic compounds and many odors. The core Airocide™ technology has been in use on the International Space Station and is based on photo-catalytic oxidation (PCO), a bioconversion process that continuously converts damaging molds, microorganisms, dangerous pathogens, destructive volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and biological gasses into harmless water vapor. Unlike other air purification systems that provide “active” air cleaning, ozone producing systems, ionization or “photo-electrochemical oxidation”, Airocide’s™ nanocoating technology permanently bonds titanium dioxide to the surface of the catalytic bed. This permits the perpetual generation of surface-bound (OH-) radicals over the large surface area created by their advanced geometric design and prevents the generation and release of ozone and other harmful byproducts. The proprietary formulation and methods for creating the catalyst are the basis of Airocide’s™ competitive advantage, making it the only consistently robust, highly effective, ozone free PCO technology on the market. Airocide™ has been tested over the past 12 years by governmental agencies such as NASA, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, independent universities including the University of Wisconsin, Texas Tech University, and Texas A&M, as well as air quality science laboratories. Airocide™ technology is listed as a FDA Class II Medical Device, making it a suitable for providing medical grade air purification in critical hospital use cases. Airocide™ Product lines include APS (consumer units), the GCS and HD lines (commercial units that will include the Sterilumen App to bring connectivity, reporting and asset management to our suite of products). The APS series provides true choice, low maintenance filter-less PCO or a filtered PCO air purification option ideal for restaurants, conference rooms, residential and small business or home office spaces. The GCS series is suitable for larger public spaces and enclosed rooms that may have high occupancy such as offices, waiting rooms and hotel lobbies, and airport gate areas. The HD series is the most powerful, providing two-stage purification for fast sanitization of larger or industrial spaces such as sporting venues and locker rooms, airports, museums, winery cellars, warehouses, and food-processing facilities. All Airocide™ products also extend the life of any perishables like fruit, produce or flowers.
 On October 13, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Old SAM Partners, LLC F/K/A Scientific Air Management, LLC (“Old SAM”), which owned a line of air purification technologies (“Scientific Air”). The Scientific Air product line uses a combination of UVC and a proprietary, patented system to eliminate airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, viruses, volatile organic compounds, and many odors without producing any harmful by-products. Scientific Air’s products are well suited for larger spaces within a facility due to the higher air flow of these units. The units are also mobile with industrial grade casters, allowing for movement throughout a facility to address increased bio burden from larger meetings or increased human traffic. Both of these key items extend our Airocide line, creating a comprehensive air disinfection portfolio that spans from small to large spaces and mobile applications. Scientific Air’s products are currently sold predominantly in North America and into the healthcare market.
 PURO Lighting
 On January 26, 2023 we acquired PURO Lighting LLC (“PURO”) and its operating subsidiaries (the “PURO Acquisition”) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated December 19, 2022 (the “PURO Merger Agreement”) for (i) $4,056,789 in the obligations to pay certain PURO debt and transaction costs, (ii) 2,497,220 shares of our common stock, (iii) 251,108 shares of our 5% Series C Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) and (iv) the payment to PURO former equity interest holders of earnout payments on the terms and conditions described in the PURO Merger Agreement.
 PURO Lighting was founded in 2019 with the goal of using light technology to promote health and wellness within spaces. Today PURO provides a suite of UV disinfection systems that have the ability to disinfect air and surfaces in commercial and industrial spaces. They focus their sales efforts in three primary verticals: Education, Government, and Healthcare.

With its UL listed and patented portfolio of independently tested (Resonova Labs) synergistic surface and air disinfection technologies that help facility managers protect against multiple pathogens; PURO opens new opportunities for cross marketing sales to existing distribution channels. Additionally, the potential to inter-connect our entire portfolio of disinfection technology solutions into the IoT will provide our customers with both products and smart tools to manage and monitor indoor air quality (IAQ) across any enterprise. Applied UV’s proprietary platform suite of patented technologies offers the most complete pathogen disinfection platform including mobile, fixed and HVAC systems and solutions allowing companies to implement the IAQ measures recommended by the EPA.  PURO boast a strong domestic sales network with reps in 43 states, and distribution in all 50 states.  Their product offerings encompass a range of innovative solutions, including UVC systems for air handling, in-room continuous disinfection using cutting-edge Far-UVC technology, and specialized surface disinfection solutions designed specifically for the healthcare industry.
 The Puro Acquisition further positions the Company to address a growing air disinfection market trend that aligns with the White House “Clean Air Initiatives” implemented during the height of the COVID 19 Pandemic designed to protect consumers and businesses against existing and future airborne pathogens allowing economies globally to remain open. The merged entities have proven applications that can now be included in improving indoor air quality (IAQ) at the facility level including HVAV systems in public, government, municipal, retail spaces and buildings. The Puro Acquisition positions Applied UV to be one of the only companies in the world to offer a complete air and surface disinfection platform that includes consumer, fixed and mobile, and commercial applications that are research backed, clinically tested and that are used by global Fortune 100 end users in multiple verticals.

 Market Opportunity
 According to Research and Markets, the UV Disinfection market is expected to reach $9 billion by 2027 as technology continues to improve and the focus on stopping the spread of contagious diseases increases. The Center for Disease Control states that 1 in 25 patients have at least one Hospital Associated Infection (HAI) annually and that 3 million serious infections occur every year in long-term care facilities. Losses from contagious infections, pathogens, and viruses cost the U.S. economy more than $270B every year as per the CDC: $28B lost through HAI’s; $225B in lost productivity due to absenteeism; and $25B in losses due to Student/Teacher absenteeism. Scientists globally have been advocating improving air quality post pandemic, significantly boosting global adoption to control airborne pathogen transmission.  Governments globally mandating health agencies to address improving indoor air quality (IAQ) via grants and mechanisms to ease visitation and protect facilities against future pathogens (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – CMS, February 2022 Long-term Care Initiative April 2022 WH Clean Air Initiatives).
 Indoor air quality (IAQ) has become an even more important issue as world economies transition beyond the COVID 19 pandemic. In 2021, 39 scientists reiterated the need for a “paradigm shift” and called for improvements in, “how we view and address the transmission of respiratory infections to protect against unnecessary suffering and economic losses.”  In mid 2022 we began to see this seismic shift from pandemic related mobile apparatuses to complete systems within systems for facilities designed to monitor, improve, and report on a more permanent basis.  While there are opportunities for mobile systems, our emphasis will be on this growing market trend.  
 In addition to this, the global air purifier market size is set to grow exponentially. It was valued at $9.24 billion in 2021 and is predicted to grow to approximately $22.84 billion by 2030. According to Precedence Research, the immense demand for air purification and sterilization in the US will be driven by the commercial sector.  
 Sterilumen’s product portfolio is one of the only research-backed, clinically proven pure-play air and surface disinfection technology companies with international distribution and globally recognized end users, with product developed for NASA.  In addition to the numerous recognized research institutions and globally recognized names who published the reports that were completed by the acquired companies, Airocide was independently proven to kill SARS, MERSA and Anthrax.  Sterilumen’s air purification (Airocide, Scientific Air & PURO Lighting) and surface disinfection (Lumicide) were independently tested and proven to kill both Candida Auris (Resinnova Laboratories) and SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) (MRIGlobal), MRSA (Resinnova Laboratories), Salmonella enterica (Resonnova Laboratories) and Escherichia coli (Resinnova Laboratories).  
 Our goal is to build a company that successfully designs, develops, and markets our air and surface disinfection solutions that will enable US and global economies to implement “Clean Air” initiatives aimed at improving indoor air quality (IAQ) as recommended by the US Government’s EPA. We will seek to achieve this goal by having our products actively involved in the following activities:
