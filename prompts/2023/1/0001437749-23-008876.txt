Our Business - Innovator and Solution Provider
 
BioLargo, Inc. invents, develops, and commercializes innovative platform technologies to solve challenging environmental problems like PFAS contamination (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), advanced water and wastewater treatment, industrial odor control, air quality control, infection control, and myriad environmental remediation challenges. Having conducted continual and extensive research and development, BioLargo holds a wide array of issued patents, maintains a robust pipeline of products, and provides full-service environmental engineering. With a keen emphasis on partnerships with academic, government, and commercial organizations and associations, BioLargo has proven itself by executing on challenging environmental engineering projects, demonstrating its powerful technologies through pilots, trials, and early commercial adoption, publishing high-impact academic and industry publications, and winning over 90 grants. We monetize our innovations through direct sales and recurring service contracts, as well as through channel partnerships, meaning licensing agreements, exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements, brand development partnerships, sale referral partnerships, strategic joint venture formation, and/or the sale of the IP. Channel partnerships allow us to extend the commercial reach of our products and services disproportionately to our core infrastructure and staffing.
 
Our revenues more than doubled in 2022 as compared with 2021, and that trend is continuing in the first quarter of 2023. The standout has been the pet odor product (brand name “Pooph”) sold by our consumer packaged goods partners at Ikigai Marketing Works, whose sales contributed significantly to the record product revenues of our odor and VOC control products division ONM Environmental.
 
We have several key ongoing projects that Company management believes will stimulate accelerated growth through 2023. These are:
 

● | The launch in major retailers of the Pooph pet odor control product by our consumer packaged goods partners at Ikigai.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our first PFAS removal project at a large industrial site (announced in August 2022), currently in the initial phase of a multi-phase process, which we expect to continue advancing as we engineer a comprehensive PFAS mitigation plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanded commercial roll-out of our PFAS treatment technology through a growing network of sales rep organizations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Garratt-Callahan’s launch of the jointly developed minimal liquid discharge wastewater treatment product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our engineering work with Ultra Safe Nuclear.
--+----------------------------------------------


● | Our engineering services division’s engagements as consultants to support large capital projects which are sponsored and or financed by the customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    2 

  

These projects are of a greater commercial significance than projects contracted and executed in previous years. Company management believes BioLargo is now earning more significant commercial opportunities for multiple reasons:         
 

1. | Credibility
---+------------

 
First, we have built our credibility as cleantech technology innovators and environmental engineering service providers to the point where clients, potential clients, and prospective partners rightfully view us as an effective and reliable means to solve their challenges. We operate with a mandate to serve our customers and partners with technical excellence, provide timely and cost-effective results, and a commitment to helping them make the best choices for any particular challenge.
 

2. | Channel Partner Relationships
---+------------------------------

 
We have key relationships that we believe will continue advancing to become high-revenue and profit generating projects with channel partners such as Garratt-Callahan and Ikigai, as well as our new channel partners in the PFAS remediation industry. 
 

3. | Investments in Talent and Technology
---+-------------------------------------

 
This “critical mass” of credibility as a cleantech solutions provider is a result of our investments in our talented team of engineers, scientists and team members who have a proven track record of executing complex engineering projects, and our history of developing creative and powerful new technologies that work and are best of class. Secondly, our core patented water treatment technologies – the BioLargo Advanced Oxidation System (AOS) and Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC) – have now been demonstrated in successful pilot projects, either on-site at a prospective client’s facility, or in-house with client-provided contaminated waters.
 
Technology
 
BioLargo has continually advanced its robust portfolio of technologies since the first acquisition of early iterations of the BioLargo technology in the spring of 2007. Our innovations have primarily been developed through our internal resources, and some through acquisition. These include patents, patents pending, and trade secrets that include solutions for:

● | Water decontamination, including:
--+----------------------------------


o | Removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and chlorides from drinking and ground water
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Micro-pollutant destruction and removal
--+----------------------------------------


o | Legionella detection and water treatment solutions

Purpose
 
Our mission to make life better drives us to serve others with integrity, knowledge, technology, and solutions that protect the environment, improve quality of life, and protect lives. Most of our technologies were developed from the ground-up to be sustainable, practical solutions to significant global challenges. We are unique in our ability to tailor our offerings to serve our customers with proven expertise, proven technology and, if needed, we often have the ability to develop new technical solutions to meet our customers’ needs.
 
Combating the PFAS Forever-Chemical Crisis – the AEC
 
One of the most significant and timely innovations in our portfolio is our per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal and collection/disposal solution we call the Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC). Our engineers developed and are now commercializing the AEC, which is a novel water treatment system that removes PFAS from water at a lower operating cost and generating only a fraction of the PFAS-laden waste of the most common currently used solutions (carbon filtration, ion exchange, and reverse osmosis). PFAS chemicals have been linked to cancer, immune disorders, liver dysfunction, and many other human health problems, and are contained in a vast range of manufactured goods, common household products (e.g., cleaning products, cookware), and electronics, and contaminate drinking water in unsafe levels all over the globe.
 
PFAS is often referred to as the “contaminant of the decade”, and as such, it is considered a multi-billion dollar commercial market opportunity. The EPA proposed new drinking water standards on March 14, 2023, limiting certain PFAS chemicals to four parts per trillion – a standard our AEC can meet. We believe these proposed rules will continue to push the market to find and adopt commercially viable solutions to remove PFAS chemicals from water. Additionally, some emerging regulations on PFAS in the U.S. are expected to skew the market toward seeking treatment technologies that produce as little PFAS-laden solid waste as possible, a favorable trend for our AEC that generates very little PFAS-laden waste. Detection of unsafe levels of PFAS around the world has given rise to a number of market opportunities, including in drinking water, industrial wastewater, municipal wastewater, solid waste, organic foods and more.
 
We have successfully validated the AEC as an effective system to selectively extract and collect PFAS chemicals from contaminated water including performance testing that shows “non-detect” levels of removal, which meets new EPA standards. We have demonstrated more than nine months of continuous operation showing no materially significant degradation of the AEC system’s components or performance over time. We have also successfully demonstrated that the AEC is scalable to a commercial scale and that our engineering team has the proven experience to successfully deliver systems to meet the needs of a commercial installation and sale. Our team has a history of successful execution in the environmental remediation industry and the knowhow to successfully commercialize the AEC.
 
In August 2022, our engineering division secured its first customer to engineer a comprehensive PFAS mitigation plan for an industrial site. The customer contract is for the first phase of what is expected to be a multi-phase comprehensive PFAS remediation project. The contract was secured in collaboration with a new channel partner, which has been appointed to promote, market, and distribute BioLargo’s water treatment equipment and PFAS-related engineering and project integration services. We recently delivered a proposal for a system that will serve as a mobile commercial pilot, and scoping, preliminary design and budget for the building of the full-scale system.
 
The AEC’s commercial roll-out will be executed with the help of a network of sales representative organizations whose role will be to market and sell the treatment system, related equipment, and the Company’s engineering services to municipal and industrial customers across the country. We have secured channel partner agreements with several sales representative organizations ensuring coverage for most of the continental United States.
 
In October 2022, we entered into a channel partner agreement with Product Recovery Management, Inc. to sell, distribute and act as a contract manufacturer for the AEC and other BioLargo water treatment technologies. Product Recovery Management (PRM), based out of Butner, NC, is a UL-certified equipment integrator specializing in remediation services with over 40 years of history serving customers. PRM designs and manufactures treatment systems that address a wide variety of contamination challenges in the remediation and landfill industries, including PFAS contamination. Their Butner operations include a 250,000 square foot manufacturing facility with large-scale fabrication capabilities.
 
    4 

  

We are also in negotiations with multiple prospective industrial and municipal customers to treat PFAS contaminated water.  In light of the fact that we now have our first commercial project under contract, we believe that our expected success with an industrial customer will be a key factor to help advance marketing efforts in the municipal market as well as potentially minimizing the need for small scale field piloting, which can be expensive and time consuming.
 
ONM Environmental - Industrial Odor and VOC Solutions
 
ONM Environmental, Inc. is BioLargo’s subsidiary that delivers robust and comprehensive products and services to control and mitigate odor and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) emitted from a variety of industrial activities, including landfills and other waste handling facilities. Its flagship product – CupriDyne® Clean – reduces and eliminates tough odors and VOCs in various industrial settings. CupriDyne® Clean is delivered through misting systems, sprayers, water trucks and similar water delivery systems designed, manufactured and installed by ONM. We believe the product is the number-one performing odor-control product in the market, and that it offers substantial savings to our customers compared with competing products. ONM Environmental holds General, Electrical, Plumbing and Low Voltage contractor licenses issued by the California Contractors State License Board, and offers a menu of services to landfills, transfer stations, wastewater treatment facilities as well as facilities in non-waste related industries. These services include engineering design, construction, installation, ongoing maintenance and on-site support services to assist our clients in the implementation and continued use of the various systems that deliver our liquid products in the field (such as misting systems).
 
We have been and expect to continue selling product to the largest solid waste handling companies in the country, with a portion of chemistry product sales resulting from national purchasing agreements (NPAs), and are also serving municipalities.
 
In addition to its goal to keep growing its revenues organically through the sale of odor and VOC control chemistry and air quality control systems to its primary market segment (municipal solid waste handling in California), ONM Environmental aims to accelerate its growth through development of new sales and distribution channels without being limited by our own sales and distribution infrastructure, such as through our partnership with Ikigai Marketing Works, LLC (see “Consumer Packaged Goods Products” below).
 
Consumer Packaged and Private-Label Products
 
We sell pet odor-control products under the brand “Pooph” to Ikigai Marketing Works, LLC, founded by accomplished industry executives from the consumer-packaged goods industry who have executed successful launches of at least five blockbuster products. After a successful test marketing phase, they have been executing a national advertising campaign through extensive television and internet advertising and have launched the product for web sales on their own website and on Amazon. In late 2022, Ikigai launched the Pooph product in a limited number of Walmart retail stores, to Walmart stores nationwide in the second quarter of 2023. Our agreement with Ikigai grants them an exclusive license to sell the Pooph pet odor-control product, and requires, in addition to purchasing product from us at an agreed-upon manufacturing margin, they are required to pay us an additional six percent of their sales.
 
As Ikigai has expanded their national television advertising expanding, their sales have increased, and correspondingly, their purchase of product from us has increased, such that for the year ended December 31, 2022, it comprised almost 50% of our total revenue. Ikigai management expects this trend of growth to continue as the product experiences increased adoption in retail stores around the country.

South Korean Joint Venture
 
On February 12, 2020, we executed a “Joint Venture Framework Agreement” with a leading wastewater treatment solution provider based in South Korea (BKT Co. Ltd., “BKT”), to create a South Korean entity that would manufacture odor and VOC control products based on our CupriDyne® Clean products. We own 40% of the joint venture. Although the joint venture established manufacturing and is marketing the product, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the expected growth of the company. While the management team continues to market the product to industrial clients, their efforts have struggled to gain a foothold, and we are in discussions to expand their license to allow for the sale of consumer products.
Full Service Environmental Engineering
 
Our subsidiary BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC (“BLEST”) offers full service environmental engineering to third parties and provides engineering support services to our internal teams to accelerate the commercialization of our technologies.
 
BLEST focuses its efforts in three areas:
 

● | providing engineering services to third-party clients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | supporting internal product development and business units’ services to customers (e.g., the AOS); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advancing their own technical innovations such as the AEC PFAS treatment technology and the battery energy storage system which was recently added to the portfolio.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The subsidiary is located in Oak Ridge (a suburb of Knoxville, Tennessee), and employs a group of scientists and engineers most of whom collectively worked together for almost 30 years and have experience in diverse engineering fields. The team is led by Randall Moore, who served as Manager of Operations for Consulting and Engineering for the Knoxville office of CB&I Environmental & Infrastructure and was formerly a leader at The Shaw Group, Inc., a Fortune 500 global engineering firm. Many of the other team members are also former employees of CB&I and Shaw, with the exception of more recent staff hires. The team is highly experienced across multiple industries and are considered experts in their respective fields, including: chemical engineering, wastewater treatment (including design, operations, data gathering and data evaluation), process safety, energy efficiency, air pollution, design and control, technology evaluation, technology integration, air quality management & testing, engineering management, permitting, industrial hygiene, applied research and development, air testing, environmental permitting, HAZOP review, chemical processing, thermal design, computational fluid dynamics, mechanical engineering, mechanical design, NEPDES permitting, RCRA/TSCA compliance and permitting, project management, storm water design & permitting, computer assisted design (CAD), bench chemistry, continuous emission monitoring system operator, data handling and evaluation and decommissioning and decontamination of radiological and chemical contaminated facilities. The team has decades of high-level experience in the energy industry. The engineering team has also developed an extended network of trusted engineering subcontractors that assist in serving specific client projects as needed.
 
In association with Garratt-Callahan, a national industrial water treatment company, BLEST developed a “minimal liquid discharge” (MLD) wastewater treatment system based on Garratt-Callahan’s patented technology that is able to reduce industrial wastewater discharge and therefore reduce wastewater discharge fees for customers. Garratt-Callahan is currently marketing the MLD system to its customers. BLEST will serve as the manufacturing partner and Garratt-Callahan will serve as the selling distributor to leverage their national sales force and over one hundred years of providing services and products to customers. BioLargo’s engineers completed the first full-scale prototype of this new technology and tested it with Garratt-Callahan client provided water, with Garratt-Callahan technical staff present on-site at BLEST’s facility. In this “factory acceptance” testing, the system removed over 98% of the target contaminants from water in continuous operation, in line with results achieved by Garratt-Callahan’s original bench-scale and batch processing tests. This factory acceptance testing was a necessary step before commercial trials and/or sales to Garratt-Callahan customers could begin. Garratt-Callahan has identified multiple customer prospects, as has BioLargo, through its own marketing efforts. We remain confident that this innovation and partnership will find commercial success.

In the second quarter of 2022, BLEST was contracted by Ultra Safe Nuclear to assist in producing the first prototype fuel production systems for their revolutionary new nuclear reactor called the Micro Modular Reactor (MMR®). Ultra Safe Nuclear is a Seattle-based nuclear energy innovator, and has invented a “fission battery” - a fourth generation modular nuclear reactor – that can deliver safe, zero-carbon, cost-effective energy anywhere. The MMR® uses ceramic-encapsulated nuclear fuel – Fully Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM+++) – an extremely rugged and stable fuel with extraordinary high temperature stability. BioLargo has been retained to provide engineering design support, fabrication, and integration for the company’s prototype fuel production systems. Because of the success of the early phase of the project, this project is expected to expand over the coming months in scope and significance to BioLargo, making them an important customer for BLEST.
 
Waste-to-Energy Conversion Plant Project
 
In April 2022, our engineering subsidiary was hired by a Southern California based sustainable energy services company to conduct a comprehensive project plan (i.e., “feasibility study”) for a waste-to-energy (WTE) conversion plant in South America – one of multiple projects in planning stages by the company. Our engineers completed the initial feasibility study and have delivered a proposal for the next phase of the project (front end engineering design, aka FEED). The client has also requested feasibility studies and a FEED proposal for WTE plants in Asia.
 
BioLargo Water and the Advanced Oxidation System – AOS
 
BioLargo Water is our wholly owned subsidiary located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, which has and is commercializing our Advanced Oxidation water treatment system (AOS). The AOS is our patented water treatment device that generates highly oxidative and energetic species of iodine and other molecules which allow it to eliminate pathogenic organisms and organic contaminants rapidly and effectively as water passes through the device. The key value proposition of the AOS is its ability to reduce or eliminate a wide variety of waterborne contaminants with high performance while using very little electricity and input chemicals. This is made possible by the highly oxidative iodine compounds and reactive oxygen species generated within the AOS reactor as well as the unique and proprietary physical constitution and geometry of the reactor. Our proof-of-concept studies and on-site pilot projects have generated results that project the AOS will be more cost- and energy-efficient than commonly used advanced water treatment technologies such as UV, electro-chlorination, and ozonation. Furthermore, our technology has been proven capable of removing hard-to-treat organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals from water more quickly and energy-efficiently than other technologies. Together, these characteristics make the AOS an economical and versatile tool to enable wastewater treatment and reuse in the face of emerging water contaminants and increasing regulatory scrutiny on industrial wastewater discharge. The capabilities of the AOS as a sustainable water treatment technology have been the subject of several high-impact academic papers in scientific journals. The company pursues a policy of publishing about the technology in academic journals as much as possible in order to promote transparency about the technology’s safety and efficacy while also contributing to the field of advanced water treatment science. In June of 2022, the fourth peer-reviewed scientific paper about the AOS was published, in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research.
 
In the first quarter of 2022, BioLargo Water received a grant from Next Generation Manufacturing Canada (NGen) to support the company’s collaboration with a specialized electrical component designer to assist in optimizing the electrical performance of the AOS with the ultimate goal of maximizing the lifespan of the AOS’ components. In the second quarter of 2022, the development work funded by this grant advanced, focusing on improving the performance of the conductive materials within the AOS which allow for water disinfection and decontamination.
 
    7 

  

The AOS has been included as a component of treatment train (comprehensive system) for a number of projects being scoped and budgeted through our engineering subsidiary. In addition, it has been included in the catalog of offerings being sold through our independent representatives as well as channel partners.
 
Municipal Wastewater Treatment Pilot – Montreal
 
Our commercial-scale AOS demonstration pilot (run in partnership with acclaimed water experts at the Centre des Technologies de L’Eau) at a municipal wastewater treatment plant near Montreal, Quebec, is ongoing and providing important data that shows the AOS is removing five target pharmaceuticals from the wastewater faster and using less electricity than the ultraviolet (UV) disinfections system used in the facility. Notably, the pilot project also showed that the AOS was able to also remove total coliforms (bacteria) from the municipal wastewater more effectively than the UV disinfection system currently in use at the facility.
 
In January 2022, BioLargo Water was awarded a grant from the government of Canada’s Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) that allowed for the extension of the pilot project to allow for use of a new, higher flow-rate AOS system, as well as the installation of an AEC system at the pilot to assess its removal of PFAS chemicals from the municipality’s wastewater, which was completed successfully.
 
Clyra Medical Technologies
 
Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. is our partially owned subsidiary creating medical products based on our technology. It is launching a product to be used by surgeons generally, with a first target market aimed toward orthopedic surgeons for use as a wound irrigation solution and to help manage patient care and outcomes and, for wound care. Clyra has secured its first two hospital customers for the product, established a robust quality control system for FDA compliance, recruited a national director of sales, and is negotiating with three separate channel partners to form a commercial alliance. It has secured its first manufacturer’s representatives and is actively expanding these efforts to build out a national rep network. Its other product designs are on hold until such time as it is able to secure the capital and resources to complete any final development and support additional inventory, technical support and sales for these products. There are channel partnerships in development for Clyra’s Bioclynse product in three separate healthcare markets.
BioLargo Energy Technologies, Inc. 
 
BioLargo acquired a proprietary sodium-sulfur battery technology and has formed and secured initial capital for a subsidiary – BioLargo Energy Technologies, Inc. (“BETI”) – designed to address the ongoing shift toward renewable energy production and the growth in global electricity demand, and the consequent drastic expansion in energy storage capacity in the US and world-wide that will be needed to accommodate increased demand and the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
 
BETI will lead the manufacturing, scale-up, and operations for the sodium-sulfur battery technology with the help of one of the technology’s original developers, who has joined BETI. Batteries built based on the underlying technology a decade ago demonstrated features that far surpass comparable lithium-ion batteries, the dominant incumbent technology in the market:
 

● | This sodium-sulfur battery technology demonstrates increased safety, no runaway fire risks, and a more sustainable design – with no rare-earth elements – that is capable of being manufactured completely from the domestic supply chain.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unlike lithium-ion batteries, BioLargo’s battery can charge and discharge completely, with no degradation of performance, ensuring virtually unlimited charge/discharge cycles, without self-discharge.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BioLargo’s battery technology also demonstrates increased energy efficiency and energy density in comparison to lithium-ion batteries, and a longer useful life expectancy of at least 10 years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    8 

  

BioLargo’s battery uses common, inexpensive, domestically available materials, and through its unique design and manufacturing process, creates an energy storage solution that has higher energy density than lithium virtually unlimited charge/discharge cycles, stable and secure supply chain management, and which is far safer than lithium-ion batteries, the current dominant energy storage technology. While the concept of sodium-sulfur salt batteries is not new (a concept conceived more than 80 years ago), no known competing ‘salt’ battery can match the performance metrics of our battery.
 
Our battery technology operates at higher temperatures, and its casing and materials when combined, are heavier than lithium-ion, making it more suitable for stationary energy storage applications like grid-scale energy storage, electric vehicle charging stations, and commercial and residential energy storage, and believed to be less suitable for placement into electric vehicles or portable electronics.
 
Conclusion
 
BioLargo has advanced its technologies and infrastructure to achieve a critical mass to capitalize on its commercial efforts and have a positive impact around the world with clean water, clean air, and infection control solutions. We have a scalable business model that targets high-impact cleantech market opportunities. We leverage our considerable scientific, engineering, and entrepreneurial talent to monetize our technologies and ensure high-quality customer service and increased revenue potential. We seek to unlock the value of our portfolio of disruptive technologies to advance our mission to “make life better” and continue creating shareholder value.
Intellectual Property
 
We have 25 patents issued, including 19 in the United States, and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio, and we believe that our technology is sufficiently useful and novel that we have a reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections. We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio.
 
We regard our intellectual property as critical to our ultimate success. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and technologies in geographic areas of commercial interest and to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information through laws and contractual arrangements.
 
We incurred approximately $1,319,000 in expense related to our research and development activities in the year ended December 31, 2022, and $1,367,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
The description of our intellectual property, at present, is as follows:

Pending Patent Applications
 
Subject to adequate financing, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our suite of intellectual property through ongoing focus on product development, new intellectual property development and patent applications, and further third-party testing and validations for specific areas of focus for commercial exploitation. We currently anticipate that additional patent applications will be filed during the next 12 months with the USPTO and the PCT, although we are uncertain of the cost of such patent filings, which will depend upon the number of such applications prepared and filed. The expenses associated with seeking patent rights in multiple foreign countries is expensive and will require substantial ongoing capital resources. However, we cannot give any assurance that adequate capital will be available. Without adequate capital resources, we will be forced to abandon patent applications and irrevocably lose rights to our technologies.
