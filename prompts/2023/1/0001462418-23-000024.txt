We classify revenue in three categories: service revenue, revenue from reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests. In evaluating our performance, we focus on service revenue. Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services. Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin. Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services that we pass directly on to our customers without a markup. Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Lenders One. Lenders One is a mortgage cooperative managed, but not owned, by Altisource. The Lenders One members’ earnings are included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource.

Customers
Overview
Our customers include large financial institutions, government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), banks, asset managers, servicers, investors, property management firms, real estate brokerages, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, originators, correspondent and private money lenders.
Customer Concentration
Ocwen
Ocwen Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Ocwen”) is a residential mortgage loan servicer of mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) it owns, including those MSRs in which others have an economic interest, and a subservicer of loans owned by others.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Ocwen was our largest customer, accounting for 41% of our total revenue. Ocwen purchases certain mortgage services from us under the terms of services agreements and amendments thereto (collectively, the “Ocwen Services Agreements”) with terms extending through August 2030. Certain of the Ocwen Services Agreements contain a “most favored nation” provision and also grant the parties the right to renegotiate pricing, among other things.
Revenue from Ocwen primarily consists of revenue earned from the loan portfolios serviced and subserviced by Ocwen when Ocwen engages us as the service provider, and revenue earned directly from Ocwen, pursuant to the Ocwen Services Agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue from Ocwen of $63.5 million and $55.6 million, respectively. Revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of segment and consolidated revenue was as follows:

 | 2022 | | 2021
Servicer and Real Estate | 53 | % | | 49 | %
Origination | — | % | | — | %
Corporate and Others | — | % | | — | %
Consolidated revenue | 41 | % | | 31 | %

We earn additional revenue related to the portfolios serviced and subserviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen or the MSRs owner selects Altisource as the service provider. For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $9.5 million of such revenue. These amounts are not included in deriving revenue from Ocwen and revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of revenue discussed above.
As of December 31, 2022, accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $4.0 million, $3.2 million of which was billed and $0.8 million of which was unbilled. As of December 31, 2021, accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $3.0 million, $2.8 million of which was billed and $0.2 million of which was unbilled.
Rithm
Rithm Capital Corp. (individually, together with one or more of its subsidiaries or one or more of its subsidiaries individually, “Rithm”) (formerly New Residential Investment Corp., or “NRZ”) is a real estate investment trust that invests in and manages investments primarily related to residential real estate, including MSRs and excess MSRs.
Ocwen has disclosed that Rithm is its largest client. As of December 31, 2022 approximately 17% of loans serviced and subserviced by Ocwen (measured in unpaid principal balance (“UPB”)) were related to Rithm MSRs or rights to MSRs (the “Subject MSRs”).
Table of Contents

Rithm purchases brokerage services for REO exclusively from us, irrespective of the subservicer, subject to certain limitations, for certain MSRs set forth in and pursuant to the terms of a Cooperative Brokerage Agreement, as amended, and related letter agreement (collectively, the “Brokerage Agreement”) with terms extending through August 2025.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue from Rithm of $3.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively, under the Brokerage Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized additional revenue of $13.0 million and $13.6 million, respectively, relating to the Subject MSRs when a party other than Rithm selects Altisource as the service provider.

Our services are provided to customers predominantly located in the United States.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing team has extensive relationship management and industry experience. These individuals cultivate and maintain relationships throughout the industry sectors we serve. We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, GSEs, buyers and sellers of homes for investment use and financial services firms.
Our primary sales and marketing focus areas are to:
•Expand relationships with existing customers by cross-selling additional services and growing the volume of existing services we provide. We believe our customer relationships represent meaningful growth opportunities for us.
•Develop new customer relationships by leveraging our comprehensive suite of services, performance and controls. We believe there are meaningful growth opportunities to sell our suite of services to new customers.
Given the highly regulated nature of the industries that we serve, and the comprehensive purchasing process that our institutional customers and prospects follow, the time and effort we spend in expanding relationships or winning new relationships is significant. For example, it can often take more than one year from the request for proposal or qualified lead stage to the selection of Altisource as a service provider. Furthermore, following the selection of Altisource, it is not unusual for it to take an additional six to twelve months or more to negotiate the services agreement(s), complete the implementation procedures and begin receiving referrals.
Intellectual Property and Data 
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trademarks and copyrights to establish and protect our trade secrets, intellectual property, software, technology and expertise. We also own or, as we deem necessary and appropriate, have obtained licenses from third parties to intellectual property relating to our services, processes and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors in the success of our businesses.
As of December 31, 2022, we have been awarded one patent that expires in 2023, one patent that expires in 2024, seven patents that expire in 2025, two patents that expire in 2026, one patent that expires in 2027, two patents that expire in 2029, one patent that expires in 2030 and one patent that expires in 2036. In addition, we have registered trademarks in a number of jurisdictions including the United States, the European Union (“EU”), India and five other jurisdictions. These trademarks generally can be renewed indefinitely, provided they are being used in commerce.
We actively protect our rights and intend to continue our policy of taking the measures we deem reasonable and necessary to develop and protect our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights.
In addition, we may make use of data in connection with certain of our services. This data generally relates to mortgage information, real property information and consumer information. We gather this data from a variety of third party sources, including from governmental entities and, subject to licensed usage rights, we use this data in connection with the delivery of certain of our services, including combining it with proprietary data we generate to further enhance data and metrics in connection with our services.
Market and Competition
We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, GSEs, buyers and sellers of homes for investment use and financial services firms. The mortgage and real estate markets are very large and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, home prices, inflation, unemployment rates, consumer confidence and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Table of Contents

The markets to provide services for mortgage servicers and mortgage originators are highly competitive and generally consist of national companies, in-house providers and a large number of regional and local providers. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product performance and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
The markets to provide services for buyers and sellers of homes for investment are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and start-up companies. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product performance and service delivery, ease of transacting, price and personal service.
Our competitors may have greater financial resources, brand recognition, alternative or disruptive products and technology and other competitive advantages. We cannot determine our market share with certainty, but believe for mortgage servicers we have a modest share of the market, and for the others we have a relatively small market share.
Common Stock Offering
On February 14, 2023, we closed an underwritten public offering of 4,550,000 shares of common stock (inclusive of 550,000 shares that were sold pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock), at a price to the public of $5.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $21 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
On February 22, 2023, we used $20 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay our term loans.
Term Loan Amendment
On February 9, 2023, we executed Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement effective February 14, 2023 (as amended by the Second Amendment, the “Amended Credit Agreement”).
The following is a summary of certain key terms of the Second Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement.
•The maturity date of the term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement is April 30, 2025
•If the amount of par paydown that we make on the term loans (excluding amortization and other required payments) in the aggregate using proceeds of junior capital raises (the “Par Paydown”) prior to February 14, 2024 (the “Paydown Measurement Date”) is equal to or greater than $30 million, then (subject to the representations and warranties being true and correct as of such date and there being no default or event of default being in existence as of such date) the maturity date of the term loans will be extended to April 30, 2026. Such extension is conditioned upon our payment of a 2% payment-in-kind extension fee
•The principal amortization of the term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement is 1.00% per year through April 30, 2025 and, if applicable, 12% per year for the year ended April 30, 2026
•The interest rate on the term loans will initially be Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 5.00% per annum payable in cash plus 5.00% per annum payable in kind (“PIK”). The PIK component of the interest rate will be subject to adjustment based on the amount of Par Paydown prior to the Paydown Measurement Date as set forth in the table below:

Par Paydown | PIK Component of Interest Rate
Less than $20 million | 5.00% 
$20 million+ but less than below | 4.50%

immediately subsequent calendar quarter to be, less than $35 million, then up to 2.00% in interest otherwise payable in cash in the following quarter may be paid in kind at our election
•The lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement received warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase 3,223,851 shares of Altisource common stock (the “Warrant Shares”). The number of Warrant Shares is subject to reduction based on the amount of Par Paydown by the Paydown Measurement Date as set forth in the table below.

Par Paydown | Warrant Shares
Less than $20 million | 3,223,851 
$20 million+ but less than below | 2,578,743 
$30 million+ | 1,612,705 

•The exercise price per share of common stock under each Warrant is equal to $0.01. The Warrants may be exercised at any time on and after the Paydown Measurement Date and prior to their expiration date. The Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and will be subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. The Warrants, if not previously exercised or terminated, will be automatically exercised on May 22, 2027. The Warrants are subject to a lock-up agreement, subject to customary exceptions, ending two business days after the Paydown Measurement Date
•The lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement were paid an amendment fee equal to 1.0%, substantially all of which was paid in cash at closing
•Various of the affirmative and negative covenants, mandatory prepayments, events of default and other terms to which we are subject under the Amended Credit Agreement have been modified including in many cases to be more restrictive or to reduce certain permissions previously available to us.
•Based on the February 2023 $20 million repayment of the term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, the PIK component of the interest rate decreased to 4.50% and the number of Warrant Shares decreased to 2,578,743.
Revolver Amendment
On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “First Revolver Amendment”) to our revolving credit facility effective February 14, 2023. The First Revolver Amendment establishes the credit available under our revolving credit facility at $15 million, extends the facility termination and maturity date to coincide with the maturity date of the term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, and increases the interest rate under our revolving credit facility to 10% per annum payable in cash and 3% per annum PIK. A usage fee of $750,000 will be payable upon the initial drawing under our revolving credit facility following the effectiveness of the First Revolver Amendment. Our revolving credit facility is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets, which lien will be pari passu with liens securing the term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, and our revolving credit facility will continue to be guaranteed by Altisource and substantially all of our material subsidiaries.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had the following number of employees:

 | United States | India | | Uruguay | Luxembourg | Consolidated Altisource
Total employees | 279 | | 1,142 | | 66 | | 9 | 1,496

Seasonality
Certain of our revenues can be impacted by seasonality. More specifically, revenues from property sales, loan originations and certain property preservation services in Field Services typically tend to be at their lowest level during the fall and winter months and at their highest level during the spring and summer months. However, as a result of the pandemic and related measures, the seasonal impact to revenue may not follow historical patterns.

Furthermore, certain of our services are provided at the direction of, and pursuant to, the identified requirements of our customers.

Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by or registered with various jurisdictions for the particular type of service sold or provided and to participate in regular continuing education programs. Periodically, we are subject to audits, examinations and investigations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority. Due to the inherent uncertainty of such actions, it is often difficult to predict the potential outcome or estimate any potential financial impact in connection with any such inquiries.
