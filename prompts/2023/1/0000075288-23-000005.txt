Item 1.   Business
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
Overview
We are a leading branded apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our portfolio of lifestyle brands: Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Johnny Was, Southern Tide, TBBC and Duck Head. 
Our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection can command greater loyalty and higher price points and create licensing opportunities. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value, and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing (including through rapidly shifting digital and social media vehicles); product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. Our ability to compete successfully in the apparel industry is dependent on our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated fashion products each season as well as certain core products that consumers expect from us.
To further strengthen each lifestyle brand’s connections with consumers, we directly communicate through digital and print media on a regular basis with our loyal consumers, including the approximately 2.5 million who have transacted with us in the last year. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of our brands, as evidenced by our advertising which engages our consumers by conveying the lifestyle of the brand.
We believe the attraction of each of our lifestyle brands is a direct result of years of maintaining appropriate quality and design, and appropriately restricting the distribution of our products. We believe this approach to quality, design, distribution and communication has been critical in allowing us to achieve the current retail price points, high gross margins and success for our brands.
During Fiscal 2022, 80% of our consolidated net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution, which consist of our brand specific full-price retail stores, e-commerce websites and outlets, as well as our Tommy Bahama food and beverage operations. During Fiscal 2022, the breakdown of our consolidated net sales by direct to consumer channel was as follows: full-price retail of $487 million, or 35%; e-commerce of $465 million, or 33%; food and beverage of $109 million, or 8%; and outlet operations of $66 million, or 5%. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a digital or physical setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. 
Our 257 full-price retail stores allow us the opportunity to carry a full line of current season merchandise, including apparel, accessories and other products, all presented in an aspirational brand-specific atmosphere. We believe that our full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers. Further, we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the full-price retail stores with limited in-store promotional activities enhance the value and reputation of our lifestyle brands and, in turn, strengthen our business and relationships with key wholesale customers. While about one-half of our full-price retail stores are located in warm weather resort or travel-to destinations and states, we believe there are 

7



opportunities for new stores in both warmer and colder climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting.
Our brand-specific e-commerce business continues to grow. Our e-commerce business is very profitable as we have a high gross margin on e-commerce sales of approximately 70% while averaging in excess of $125 per order. Our high average order value and high gross margins allow us to absorb any incremental picking, packing and freight expense associated with operating an e-commerce business and still maintain a high profit margin on e-commerce sales.
Additionally, our Tommy Bahama brand operates 21 food and beverage locations, including Marlin Bars and full-service restaurants, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store. These food and beverage locations provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate Tommy Bahama experience as well as attract new customers to the Tommy Bahama brand. Both Tommy Bahama and Johnny Was operate brand-specific outlet stores, which are utilized for end of season inventory clearance. 
The remaining 20% of our net sales were generated through our wholesale distribution channels, which complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger base of consumers. Our wholesale operations consist of sales of products bearing the trademarks of our lifestyle brands to various specialty stores, better department stores, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and other retailers.
As we seek to maintain the integrity and continued success of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we intend to maintain controlled distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which we sell our products and generally target wholesale customers that follow a limited promotions approach. We continue to value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of our lifestyle brands within their stores. 
We operate in a highly competitive apparel market that continues to evolve rapidly with the expanding application of technology to fashion retail. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods, which continues to be evidenced by weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, uncertain consumer retail traffic patterns, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. 
This competitive and evolving environment requires that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, very differently than they have historically and may result in increased operating costs and investments to generate growth or even maintain existing sales levels. While the competition and evolution present significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. 
No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. The apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent on the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Also, in recent years consumers have chosen to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. 
Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries due, in part, to apparel purchases often being more of a discretionary purchase. The current macroenvironment, with heightened concerns about inflation, a global economic recession, geopolitical issues, the stability of the U.S. banking system, the availability and cost of credit and continued increases in interest rates, is creating a complex and challenging retail environment, which may impact our businesses and exacerbate some of the 

8



inherent challenges to our operations. There remains significant uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and the impact of these and other factors could have a major effect on our businesses.
Investments and Opportunities
The evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers and others who fail or are unable to adapt, but we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our lifestyle brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we continue to invest in and leverage technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry. Further, each of our brands aims to further enhance its customer-focused, dynamic, thriving, digitally-driven, mobile-centered, cross-channel personalized and seamless shopping experience that recognizes and serves customers in their brand discovery and purchasing habits of the future. 
We believe there are ample opportunities to expand the reach of each of our lifestyle brands in the future, including the opening of new direct to consumer locations, e-commerce growth and wholesale operations expansion. In order to expand the reach and maximize the success of each of our brands, we believe we must continue to invest in the lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Future investments include capital expenditures primarily related to direct to consumer operations, such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and direct to consumer location build-outs for new, relocated or remodeled locations, as well as distribution center enhancements and administrative office expenditures. In addition to our capital investments, we must continue to invest in our SG&A expense infrastructure, including people, technology, advertising and other resources. While we believe that our investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on our operating margin, particularly if there is insufficient sales growth to absorb the incremental costs in a particular year. Fiscal 2023 will be a particularly heavy year for both capital expenditures and SG&A, which is expected to decrease our operating margins from the levels achieved in Fiscal 2022.
Meanwhile, as we grow we must be very diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by becoming overly promotional or maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented less than 10% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2022. 
While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands, both large and small, to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria and/or take strategic measures to return capital to our shareholders as and when circumstances merit. For example, we acquired Johnny Was on September 19, 2022. 
Important factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
Operating Groups
We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand’s direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable. With our acquisition of Johnny Was on September 19, 2022, our business is organized as our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Johnny Was and Emerging Brands operating groups. Operating results for periods prior to Fiscal 2022 also include the Lanier Apparel operating group, which we exited in Fiscal 2021. For additional information about each of our reportable operating groups as well as Corporate and Other, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, each included in this report. The table below presents certain financial information about each of our operating groups, as well as Corporate and Other (in thousands).

​
Tommy Bahama
Tommy Bahama designs, sources, markets and distributes men’s and women’s sportswear and related products. Tommy Bahama’s typical consumer is older than 45 years old, has a household annual income in excess of $100,000, lives in or travels to warm weather and resort locations and embraces a relaxed and casual approach to daily living. Tommy Bahama products can be found in our Tommy Bahama stores and on our Tommy Bahama e-commerce website, tommybahama.com, as well as at better department stores, independent specialty stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers. We also operate Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations and license the Tommy Bahama name for various product categories. During Fiscal 2022, 96% of Tommy Bahama’s sales were in the United States, with the remaining sales in Australia and Canada.
In Fiscal 2022, we increased Tommy Bahama’s sales by 22% to $880 million and operating income by 55% to $173 million, or 19.6%. For comparison, the Fiscal 2022 operating margin for Tommy Bahama was considerably higher than the 15.4% operating margin generated in Fiscal 2021, as well as the 7.9% operating margin on $677 million of net sales generated in the last pre-pandemic year of Fiscal 2019. The significant improvement in operating results reflects the efforts of an important initiative for us in recent years to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama operating 

10



group. While we made progress on this initiative prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts were really evident in our Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022 operating results. Maintaining the significantly higher post-pandemic operating income levels continues to be a focus area for the long-term prospects of the Tommy Bahama business. 
Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Tommy Bahama strategy is to operate our retail stores, e-commerce websites and food and beverage concepts, which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which the products are based. Our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer channels, which consist of full-price retail store, e-commerce, food and beverage and outlet store operations, in the aggregate, represented 83% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2022. Full-price retail store, e-commerce, food and beverage and outlet store net sales accounted for 39%, 24%, 13% and 7%, respectively, of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2022.
Our direct to consumer approach includes various e-commerce websites, including the tommybahama.com website. Our Tommy Bahama e-commerce business, which generated $214 million of net sales in Fiscal 2022, has grown significantly over the last few years, including a 16% increase in net sales compared to Fiscal 2021. Our Tommy Bahama websites allow consumers to buy Tommy Bahama products directly from us via the internet. These websites also enable us to increase our database of consumer contacts, which allows us to communicate directly and frequently with consenting consumers. As we reach more customers in the future, we anticipate that our e-commerce distribution channel for Tommy Bahama will continue to grow at a faster pace than our retail store or wholesale operations.
Our direct to consumer strategy for the Tommy Bahama brand also includes locating and operating full-price retail stores in upscale malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. Generally, we seek to locate our full-price retail stores in shopping areas and malls that have high-profile or upscale consumer brand adjacencies. As of January 28, 2023, the majority of our Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores were in street-front locations or lifestyle centers with the remainder primarily in regional indoor malls, with a number of those regional indoor locations in resort travel destinations. We believe that we have opportunities for continued sales growth for Tommy Bahama, particularly in our women’s business, which represented 34% and 33% of sales in our direct to consumer operations in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively, with women’s swim representing about one-fourth of the women’s business. For Tommy Bahama’s domestic full-price retail stores and retail-food and beverage locations operating for the full Fiscal 2022 year, sales per gross square foot, excluding food and beverage sales and food and beverage space, were approximately $790, compared to approximately $645 in Fiscal 2021. 
As of January 28, 2023, we operated 21 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations including 13 restaurants and eight Marlin Bar locations, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location. These retail-food and beverage locations, which generated approximately 25% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2022, provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate Tommy Bahama experience. We do not anticipate that the majority of our full-price retail locations will have an adjacent food and beverage location; however, we have determined that an adjacent food and beverage location can further enhance the image or exposure of the brand in select, high-profile, brand appropriate locations. The net sales per square foot in our domestic full-price retail stores that are adjacent to a food and beverage location have historically been approximately twice the sales per square foot of our other domestic full-price retail stores. We believe that the customer immersing themselves into the Tommy Bahama lifestyle by having a meal or a drink at the Tommy Bahama food and beverage location and visiting the adjacent full-price retail store may entice the customer to purchase additional Tommy Bahama merchandise and potentially provide a memorable consumer experience that further enhances the relationship between Tommy Bahama and the consumer. The Marlin Bar concept, like our traditional restaurant locations, is adjacent to one of our full-price retail store locations and serves food and beverages, but in a smaller space and with food options more focused on small plate offerings rather than entrees. We believe that the smaller footprint, reduced labor requirements and lower required capital expenditure of the Marlin Bar concept provides us with the long-term potential for opening additional retail-food and beverage locations that are more in line with evolving customer trends toward fast casual dining, particularly with younger consumers.

Typically, at the end of the summer and holiday season, Tommy Bahama will conduct sales both in-store and online to move end of season product. Utilizing Tommy Bahama’s Enterprise Order Management (EOM) system, many 

11



online orders will be fulfilled from retail stores, greatly reducing the amount of goods that ultimately get transferred from full-price retail stores to outlet stores. Tommy Bahama utilizes its outlet stores, which generated 7% of total Tommy Bahama sales in Fiscal 2022, and sales to off-price retailers to sell the remaining end of season or excess inventory. Our Tommy Bahama outlet stores are generally located in outlet shopping centers that include other upscale retailers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by often allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties. We believe that this approach has helped us protect the integrity of the Tommy Bahama brand by allowing our full-price retail stores to limit promotional activity while controlling the distribution of discontinued and out-of-season product. To supplement the clearance items sold in Tommy Bahama outlets, we merchandise our Tommy Bahama outlets with certain made-for products. Currently, we operate one outlet store for approximately every four full-price retail stores.
The table below provides certain information regarding Tommy Bahama direct to consumer locations as of January 28, 2023.

During Fiscal 2022, Florida, California, Hawaii and Texas represented 33%, 16%, 13% and 9%, respectively, of our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer retail and retail-food and beverage location sales. Including e-commerce sales, during Fiscal 2022, Florida, California, Hawaii and Texas represented 27%, 15%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of total Tommy Bahama direct to consumer sales.

​
In future periods, we anticipate that many of our new Tommy Bahama store openings will be Marlin Bar locations that are either new locations or conversions of existing full-price retail stores. Currently, we have three Marlin Bar openings scheduled for Fiscal 2023, including the conversion of Tommy Bahama full-price retail locations in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and San Antonio, Texas as well as a new Marlin Bar in Winter Park, Florida. We also have other locations in the pipeline for openings in Fiscal 2024 and beyond and anticipate opening as many as five Marlin Bar locations in Fiscal 2024, subject to lease negotiation, construction timing and other factors. We continue to look for other appropriate locations for full-price retail stores and Marlin Bars. In addition to the planned Marlin Bars, we also have 

12



two full-price retail store relocations and a couple of other new locations in negotiation. We believe that in Fiscal 2023, we may close a limited number of locations, including certain outlets and full-price retail locations.
The construction of and relocation of retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater operating costs. In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels or expansions of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. The cost of a Tommy Bahama Marlin Bar is significantly more than the cost of a full-price retail store and can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. Historically, the cost to build out our Marlin Bar locations has been approximately $3 million and future locations may be more expensive than that amount. For most of our full-price retail stores and our Marlin Bar locations, the landlord often provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we maintain a wholesale business for Tommy Bahama. Tommy Bahama’s wholesale customers include better department stores, specialty stores and multi-brand e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. We value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Tommy Bahama brand within their stores. 
With its wide distribution currently, we believe that sales growth in our men’s apparel wholesale business may be somewhat limited in the long-term. However, we believe that we may have opportunities for wholesale sales increases for our Tommy Bahama women’s business in the future, with its appeal evidenced by its performance in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites. Wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama accounted for 17% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2022. Approximately 10% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales reflects sales to major department stores with our remaining wholesale sales primarily to specialty stores. During Fiscal 2022, 12% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales were to Tommy Bahama’s 10 largest wholesale customers, with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales. 
Tommy Bahama Resort

On November 14, 2022, Tommy Bahama entered into a licensing arrangement for the first Tommy Bahama resort. Pursuant to the licensing agreement, the Miramonte Resort & Spa in Indian Wells, California will be converted into the Tommy Bahama Miramonte Resort & Spa, with an anticipated completion date in late 2023. Upon conversion of the property, Tommy Bahama will earn royalty income calculated as a percentage of revenues associated with the resort. The property will be managed and operated by a national commercial and hospitality real estate company with considerable experience in premier resort development and operations. 
Lilly Pulitzer
Lilly Pulitzer designs, sources, markets and distributes upscale collections of women’s and girl’s dresses, sportswear and related products. The Lilly Pulitzer brand was originally created in the late 1950s by Lilly Pulitzer and is an affluent brand with a heritage and aesthetic based on the Palm Beach resort lifestyle. The brand is somewhat unique among women’s brands in that it has demonstrated multi-generational appeal, including among young women in college or recently graduated from college; young mothers with their daughters; and women who are not tied to the academic calendar. Lilly Pulitzer products can be found on our Lilly Pulitzer website, lillypulitzer.com, in our owned Lilly Pulitzer stores, and in Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores, which are described below, as well as in independent specialty stores and better department stores. During Fiscal 2022, 34%, 34% and 14% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales were for women’s dresses, sportswear, and Luxletic apparel products, respectively, with the remaining sales consisting of Lilly Pulitzer accessories, including scarves, bags, jewelry and belts, children’s apparel, swim, footwear and licensed products.

Direct to Consumer Operations
Lilly Pulitzer’s direct to consumer distribution channel, which consists of e-commerce operations and full-price retail stores, represented 84% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2022. A key element of our Lilly Pulitzer strategy is the lillypulitzer.com website, which generated $172 million, or 51%, of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2022. Another key component of our Lilly Pulitzer direct to consumer strategy is to operate our own Lilly Pulitzer stores, which represented 33% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2022.
The Lilly Pulitzer e-commerce business has experienced double-digit percentage growth for many years, and we anticipate that the net sales growth of the e-commerce business will remain strong in the future. We utilize the Lilly Pulitzer website as an effective means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner and at gross margins in excess of 40% via e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales create a significant amount of excitement with loyal Lilly Pulitzer consumers, who are looking for an opportunity to purchase Lilly Pulitzer products at a discounted price and are also important in attracting new consumers to the Lilly Pulitzer brand. These e-commerce flash clearance sales typically run for three days during the summer clearance period in September and for two days during the post-holiday clearance period in January, allowing the Lilly Pulitzer website to generally remain full-price for the remaining 360 days of the year. During Fiscal 2022, 31% of Lilly Pulitzer’s e-commerce sales, or 16% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales, were e-commerce flash clearance sales. 
Our full-price retail store strategy for the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes operating full-price retail stores in higher-end lifestyle shopping centers and malls, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. As of January 28, 2023, about 40% of our Lilly Pulitzer full-price stores were located in outdoor regional lifestyle centers and approximately one-third of our Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in indoor regional malls, with the remaining locations in resort or street locations. In certain seasonal locations such as Nantucket and Watch Hill, our stores are only open during the resort season. Additionally, we may open temporary pop-up stores in certain locations.
Lilly Pulitzer’s full-price retail store sales per gross square foot for Fiscal 2022 were approximately $765 for the full-price retail stores which were open the full Fiscal 2022 year, as compared to $685 in Fiscal 2021. The table below provides certain information regarding Lilly Pulitzer direct to consumer locations as of January 28, 2023.

During Fiscal 2022, 50% of Lilly Pulitzer’s full-price retail store sales were in stores located in Florida with no other state generating more than 10% of full-price retail store sales. Including e-commerce sales, during Fiscal 2022, Florida represented 33% of total Lilly Pulitzer direct to consumer sales.
 ​
The table below reflects the changes in direct to consumer location count for Lilly Pulitzer stores during Fiscal 2022.

​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------------------+---+--------------
​ | | Full-Price 
​ | ​ | Retail Stores
Open as of beginning of fiscal year | | 58 
Opened | ​ | 3 
Closed | | (2) 
Open as of end of fiscal year | | 59 

​
Currently, we expect to open at least two new full-price retail stores in Fiscal 2023, including in Delray Beach, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina. We are in the process of identifying sites or negotiating leases for additional locations. We continue to look for other appropriate locations and anticipate returning to a pace of opening as many as five locations per year in the future. At the same time, we may relocate or close a limited number of locations at lease expiration. The construction of and relocation of retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater operating costs. In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels or expansions of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate.
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we maintain wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer. These wholesale operations, which represented 16% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2022, are primarily with Signature Stores, independent specialty stores, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. During Fiscal 2022, about one-third of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales were to Lilly Pulitzer’s Signature Stores, one-third of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales were to specialty stores and about one-fifth of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales, or less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales, were to department stores. The remaining wholesale sales were primarily to national accounts, including on-line retailers, and off-price retailers. Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales to its 10 largest wholesale customers represented 8% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2022 with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales.
An important part of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For these stores, we enter into agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all floor space specifically for Lilly Pulitzer products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. We sell products to these Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of January 28, 2023, there were 48 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores.
Johnny Was
On September 19, 2022, we acquired the Johnny Was California lifestyle brand and related operations, which includes the design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of collections of affordable luxury, artisan-inspired bohemian apparel, accessories and home goods. The Johnny Was brand was founded in 1987 and continues to transcend fashion trends with its beautifully crafted, globally inspired products and demonstrates a unique ability to combine and mix elevated fabrics, patterns, bespoke prints and artisanal embroidery that distinguishes its product in the marketplace. Johnny Was products can be found on the Johnny Was website, johnnywas.com, and in our full-price retail stores as well as select department stores and specialty stores. During the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, 90% of the net sales of Johnny Was were for women’s apparel, with the remaining sales consisting of Johnny Was accessories, including home products, shoes, scarves, handbags, and jewelry.

Direct to Consumer Operations
The Johnny Was direct to consumer distribution channel, which consists of e-commerce operations and the Johnny Was retail stores, represented 75% of the Johnny Was net sales in the 12 months ended January 28, 2023. A key element of the Johnny Was strategy is the johnnywas.com website, which generated $83 million of net sales, or 40% of the net sales of Johnny Was, in the 12 months ended January 28, 2023. Another key component of our Johnny Was direct to consumer strategy is to operate our own Johnny Was stores, which represented 35% of the net sales of Johnny Was in the 12 months ended January 28, 2023.
The Johnny Was e-commerce business has experienced very strong growth in recent years, and we anticipate that the net sales growth of the e-commerce business will remain strong in the future. Our full-price retail store strategy for the Johnny Was brand includes operating full-price retail stores in higher-end lifestyle shopping centers and malls, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. As of January 28, 2023, about 70% of the Johnny Was full-price stores were located in lifestyle centers, open air shopping environments or street front locations with the remaining 30% of locations in indoor regional malls. Full-price retail store sales per gross square foot for Johnny Was for the 12 months ended January 28, 2023 were approximately $740 for the full-price retail stores which were open the full 12 months. 
Our Johnny Was outlet stores are generally located in outlet shopping centers that include other upscale retailers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by often allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties.
The table below provides certain information regarding Johnny Was direct to consumer locations as of January 28, 2023.

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

​
During the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, 29%, 16% and 13% of the retail store sales of Johnny Was were in stores located in California, Texas and Florida, respectively. During the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, including e-commerce sales, California, Texas, and Florida represented 24%, 15% and 11%, respectively, of our total Johnny Was direct to consumer sales.

​
Currently, we expect to open approximately 10 new full-price retail stores in Fiscal 2023. During Fiscal 2023, we anticipate opening full-price retail stores across the country including stores in Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Carolina and New York as well as additional stores in California and Florida. We believe that in Fiscal 2023, we 

16



may relocate or close a limited number of locations at lease expiration. The construction of and relocation of retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. The cost to build-out a Johnny Was retail store is typically less than $0.5 million. In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels or expansions of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. 
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we maintain wholesale operations for Johnny Was. These wholesale operations are primarily with better independent specialty and department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. During the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, 25% of the net sales of Johnny Was were sales to wholesale customers. During the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, about 40% and 30% of the wholesale sales of Johnny Was were to specialty stores and department stores, respectively. The remaining wholesale sales were primarily to off-price retailers and retailers in countries outside of the United States. Net sales to the 10 largest wholesale customers of Johnny Was represented 14% of the net sales of Johnny Was in the 12 months ended January 28, 2023 with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Johnny Was’ net sales.
Emerging Brands
Emerging Brands, which was organized in Fiscal 2022, consists of the operations of our smaller, earlier stage Southern Tide, TBBC and Duck Head brands. Each of the brands included in Emerging Brands designs, sources, markets and distributes apparel and related products bearing its respective trademarks and is supported by Oxford’s emerging brands team that provides certain support functions to the smaller brands, including marketing and advertising execution, analysis and other functions. The shared resources provide for operating efficiencies and enhanced knowledge sharing across the brands. We acquired Southern Tide in 2016, Duck Head in 2016 and TBBC in 2017. 
The table below reflects the net sales (in thousands) for Fiscal 2022 by brand for each brand included in Emerging Brands.
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
--------------------------------+---+-------------+--------
​ | ​ | Fiscal 2022
Southern Tide | ​ | $ | 62,769 
TBBC | ​ | | 44,911 
Duck Head | ​ | ​ | 8,804 
Total Emerging Brands net sales | ​ | $ | 116,484

​
The brands distribute their products on their brand-specific e-commerce websites, southerntide.com, thebeaufortbonnetcompany.com and duckhead.com, as well as wholesale channels of distribution for each brand that may include independent specialty retailers, better department stores and brand specific Signature Stores. During Fiscal 2022, the majority of the sales of both Southern Tide and Duck Head were wholesale sales, while the majority of TBBC sales were direct to consumer sales. 
Also, a key component of our Southern Tide and TBBC growth strategy is to expand our direct to consumer retail store operations after both brands opened their first retail store locations in recent years. The table below provides certain information regarding the Emerging Brands direct to consumer locations as of January 28, 2023.

​
During the First Quarter of Fiscal 2023, we acquired three Southern Tide Signature Stores located in Massachusetts, and during Fiscal 2023 we expect to open at least five additional Southern Tide stores, with the majority of those in Florida, resulting in a planned store count increase of eight or more for Southern Tide during Fiscal 2023. Additionally, for TBBC, we anticipate opening two new stores during Fiscal 2023. We continue to look at additional opportunities for new full-price store locations for both Southern Tide and TBBC. The operation of full-price retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We anticipate that most future retail store openings for Southern Tide and TBBC will generally be approximately 1,500 to 2,500 square feet; however, the determination of actual size of the store will depend on a variety of criteria. 
Lanier Apparel
In Fiscal 2021, we exited our Lanier Apparel business, which had been focused on moderately priced tailored clothing and related products. This decision aligns with our stated business strategy of developing and marketing compelling lifestyle brands. It also took into consideration the increased macroeconomic challenges faced by the Lanier Apparel business, many of which were magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The operating results of the Lanier Apparel business in Fiscal 2021 largely consisted of activities associated with the wind down of operations following our Fiscal 2020 decision to exit the business. Refer to Note 11 and Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about the Lanier Apparel exit and Fiscal 2021 operating results.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, the elimination of inter-segment sales, any other items that are not allocated to the operating groups, including LIFO inventory accounting adjustments as our LIFO pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, and the operations of our Lyons, Georgia distribution center and our Oxford America business, which generated net sales of $1 million and was exited in Fiscal 2022, and our $8 million minority ownership interest in a property in Indian Wells, California that will be converted into the Tommy Bahama Miramonte Resort and Spa during Fiscal 2023.
TRADEMARKS
We own trademarks, many of which are very important and valuable to our business, including Tommy Bahama®, Lilly Pulitzer®, Johnny Was®, Southern Tide®, The Beaufort Bonnet Company® and Duck Head®. Generally, our trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on apparel and, in some cases, apparel-related products, accessories, home furnishings and beauty products, as well as in connection 

18



with retail services. We continue to evaluate our worldwide usage and registration of our trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services in the relevant jurisdiction and the required registration renewals are filed. Important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
During Fiscal 2022, we incurred $82 million, or 6% of net sales, of advertising expense. Advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy for our lifestyle brands, and we therefore devote significant resources to these efforts. Thus, we believe that it is very important that our brands communicate regularly with consumers about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen connections with consumers. Our advertising emphasizes the respective brand’s image and lifestyle and attempts to engage individuals within the target consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our e-commerce websites, direct to consumer locations or wholesale customers’ stores and websites in search of our products. 
We increasingly utilize digital marketing, social media and email, and continue to use traditional direct mail communications, to interact with our consumers. We vary our engagement tactics to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, drive conversion, build loyalty, activate consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Our creative marketing teams design and produce imagery and content, social media strategies and email and print campaigns designed to inspire the consumer and drive traffic to the brand. We attempt to increase our brand awareness through a strategic emphasis on technology and the elevation of our digital presence which encompasses e-commerce, mobile e-commerce, digital media, social media and influencer marketing. In this environment where many people are digital-first consumers, we continue to enhance our approach to digital marketing and invest in analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels. At the same time, we continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g. loyalty, ratings and reviews and mobile phone applications) and build brand equity. The ongoing trend towards a digital first consumer that was accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic provided a catalyst for accelerating the implementation of new direct to consumer business models and consumer engagement programs, such as selling through social media. 
Marketing initiatives in our direct to consumer operations may include special event promotions, including loyalty award card, Flip Side, Friends & Family and gift with purchase events and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our brands and products, drive traffic to our websites and stores, convert new consumers and increase demand and loyalty. Our various initiatives are effective in increasing online and in-store traffic resulting in the proportion of our sales that occur during our marketing initiatives increasing in recent years, which puts some downward pressure on our direct to consumer gross margins.
We believe that highly visible full-price retail stores with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit and buy merchandise. We believe that full-price retail stores attract new consumers and enhance the shopping experience of our existing customers, which will increase consumer brand loyalty, our net sales and sales of our products by our wholesale customers. 
Our marketing may also include sponsorships, collaborations, and co-branding initiatives, which may be for a particular cause or non-profit organization that is expected to resonate with target consumers. For certain of our wholesale customers, we may also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs. 
PRODUCT DESIGN
We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value, and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing (including through rapidly shifting digital and social media vehicles); product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. Our ability to compete successfully in the apparel industry is dependent on our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our 

19



design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.
Each of our lifestyle brands’ products are designed and developed by dedicated brand-specific teams who focus on the target consumer for the respective brand. The design process includes feedback from buyers, consumers and sales agents, along with market trend research. Our apparel products generally incorporate fabrics made of cotton, silk, linen, nylon, leather, tencel and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials. 
PRODUCT SOURCING
We intend to maintain flexible, diversified, cost-effective sourcing operations that provide high-quality apparel and related products. Our operating groups, either internally, using in-house employees located in the United States and/or Hong Kong, or through the use of third party buying agents, manage the production and sourcing of substantially all of our apparel and related products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries. 
Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers of apparel and related products and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. Instead, we conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Thus, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality, cost, timing of product delivery and other criteria. During Fiscal 2022, we purchased our products from more than 250 suppliers, with a significant concentration of suppliers in Asia. Our 10 largest suppliers provided approximately one-third of our product purchases. During Fiscal 2022, no individual third party manufacturer, licensee or other supplier provided more than 10% of our product purchases in total. We generally acquire products sold in our food and beverage operations from various third party domestic suppliers, with a particular emphasis on procuring sustainably sourced food and locally grown produce.
During Fiscal 2022, approximately 36%, 23%, and 11% of our apparel and related products acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China, Vietnam and Peru, respectively, with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. We expect that the percentage of our products sourced from producers located in China will increase to closer to 40% in Fiscal 2023, as Fiscal 2023 will include a full year of purchases for Johnny Was, which has a significantly higher concentration of production in China than our other brands. For the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, the percentage of products sourced from China for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Johnny Was operating groups were 40%, 23% and 92%, respectively. While we have and will continue to work on diversifying our supplier base and reducing the concentration of manufacturing from China in the future, the majority of fibers included in our apparel and other products currently originate in China even if the products are manufactured elsewhere.
We purchase our apparel and related products from third party producers, substantially all as package purchases of finished goods. These products are manufactured with oversight by us or our third party buying agents and to our design and fabric specifications. The use of third party manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us, as operating manufacturing facilities requires a significant amount of capital investment, labor and oversight. We depend on third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of specified raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. We believe that purchasing substantially all of our products as package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we are not required to purchase, or finance the purchase of, the raw materials or other production costs related to our apparel and related product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods, which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers. 
As the manufacture and transportation of apparel and related products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season, we typically make commitments months in advance of when products will arrive in our full-price retail stores or our wholesale customers’ stores. As our merchandising departments must estimate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own full-price retail stores and e-commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors, and as purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to prior to the receipt of 

20



all wholesale customer orders, we carry the risk that we have purchased more inventory than will ultimately be desired or that we will not have purchased sufficient inventory to satisfy demand, resulting in lost sales opportunities.
As part of our commitment to source our products in a lawful, ethical and socially responsible manner, each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors from whom we purchase apparel and related products, which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business or ethical standards, including related human rights, health, safety, working conditions, environmental and other requirements. We require that each of our vendors and licensees comply with the code of conduct or substantially similar compliance standards. All of our vendors from whom we purchase goods are also required by us to adhere to the United States Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program, including standards relating to facility, procedural, personnel and cargo security. 

On an ongoing basis we assess vendors’ compliance with the applicable code of conduct and applicable laws and regulations through audits performed by either our employees or our designated agents. We periodically review each tier 1 supplier’s compliance with our requirements and conduct social compliance audits more frequently depending on the severity of issues identified and the cooperation received during remediation. In the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by our required standards, we work with the vendor to remediate the violation. If the violation is not satisfactorily remediated, we will discontinue use of the vendor. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We believe that as a leading apparel company, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact and make the world a better place for all people. Our Board is ultimately charged with overseeing the risks to our business on behalf of our shareholders, and we believe that our Board’s active involvement in oversight of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives affords us tremendous benefits. We report routinely to our Board and/or various Board committees about ESG risks and strategies and communicate insights provided by our directors to our brands to assist in formulating ESG goals and initiatives. Within our Corporate team, at the end of Fiscal 2022, we created an enterprise-wide Corporate Responsibility Department reporting to our General Counsel which, with input from our Executive Leadership Team, will focus in the immediate future on assessing ESG opportunities within our industry, establishing baseline metrics and objectives which we expect to publish in the future and collaborating with our brands on potential opportunities to execute brand-specific ESG initiatives.
Reducing our Footprint
Our business operations – throughout the value chain – impact the environment, and we are committed to identifying and executing commercially viable environmental sustainability initiatives to further a safer, more sustainable world for the generations that follow us. Our brands are continuously working to improve sustainability in direct to consumer location design and operations, and we have also undertaken efforts to implement sustainability measures at our offices and distribution centers.
​
Increasing our use of sustainable materials is and will continue to be a key priority, and we are excited to introduce products crafted from sustainable materials. For example, in Fiscal 2022, we launched the Tommy Bahama Palm ModernTM line of women’s swimwear, made with 75% recycled nylon. At Southern Tide, we reintroduced the Shoreline shorts, beloved by customers for their versatility and comfort, in 100% recycled materials. Within our businesses, we also seek to use preferred materials that are more environmentally responsible than their conventional counterparts like LENZINGTM, ECOVEROTM Viscose and TENCELTM Modal and raw materials that are certified to the Global Organic Textile Standard or Global Recycled Standard.
​
Our operating groups also maintain and enforce restricted substances lists, which are informed by the American Apparel & Footwear Association Environmental Task Force restricted substances list, to ensure that the use of chemicals in our products complies with all applicable legal and safety requirements.
​
We participate in various trade initiatives and organizations to better inform ourselves about risks, opportunities and best practices. We are a proud member of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), and all of our 

21



brands are signatories to the “Commitment to Responsible Recruiting” sponsored by the AAFA and the Fair Labor Association. Our Tommy Bahama business is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, and within our organization, we have membership in Better Cotton and partnerships with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and FSC-certified suppliers.
Empowering our People
​
We believe that our long-term success as an organization relies on recruiting, developing, promoting and rewarding the best and most talented people within our industry. Diversity and inclusion are key components of our corporate responsibility framework, and we are committed to creating a culture where people have a sense of belonging and purpose to maximize their fullest potential. For more information about our workforce and diversity and inclusion initiatives, please refer to Part I, Item 1, Business—Human Capital Management.
​
Enriching our Communities
​
Since our founding in 1942, we have prided ourselves on being model citizens for the communities in which we operate. We focus our community initiatives on programs that can impact a broad set of constituents where we operate. Our community partners include the United Way of Greater Atlanta, the Woodruff Arts Center and Grady Hospital, and each of our operating groups partners with organizations improving quality of life in the communities where our customers and employees live and work, such as the Garden of Hope and Courage, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Folds of Honor and the Kentucky Children’s Hospital. 
​
In 2020, we announced the launch of the Oxford Educational Access Initiative to further our goal of reducing economic and racial inequality through access to education. We believe that every child, regardless of race or economic circumstance, deserves the chance to learn and be successful. Over the course of four years beginning in 2021, we have given and will continue to give an aggregate of $1 million to community organizations with innovative program models that address a broad spectrum of educational challenges that children in underserved communities face. Each of our brands has selected recipient organizations that are working to address disparities in educational access and barriers to success for children in our local communities.
​
IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
We are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations as substantially all of our merchandise, as well as the products purchased by our licensing partners, is manufactured by foreign suppliers as discussed above. Products imported by us, or imported by others and ultimately sold to us, are subject to customs, trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the United States and other countries where we sell our products, including various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern any of our activities that may have adverse environmental, health and safety effects. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant monetary penalties.
Substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to certain duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product. These amounts represent a component of the inventories we sell and are included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations. We paid total duties of more than $57 million on products imported into the United States directly by us in Fiscal 2022, with the average duty rate on those products of approximately 17% of the value of the imported product in Fiscal 2022. Duty rates vary depending on the type of garment, fiber content and country of origin and are subject to change in future periods. In addition, while the World Trade Organization’s member nations have eliminated quotas on apparel and textiles, the United States and other countries into which we import our products are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose "anti-dumping" or "countervailing" duties in response to threats to their comparable domestic industries.
Although we have not been materially inhibited from sourcing products from desired markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and enter into new markets. In recent years the United States government has implemented additional duties on certain product categories across various industries. It is possible that additional duty increases could occur in future years, which could have a 

22



significant unfavorable impact on the apparel retail industry and our cost of goods sold, operations, net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment, including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products. As a result of these changes and increased costs of production in certain countries that unfavorably impact our cost of goods sold, we continue to make changes in our supply chain, including exiting certain factories and sourcing those products from a factory in a different foreign country. 
In addition, apparel and other related products sold by us are subject to stringent and complex product performance and security and safety standards, laws and other regulations. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, certification of product safety and importer security procedures. We believe that we are in material compliance with those regulations. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also generally subject to such regulations.
Important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

We operate a number of distribution centers. Our Auburn, Washington, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and Los Angeles, California distribution centers serve our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Johnny Was operating groups, respectively. Additionally, a third party distribution center in Los Angeles, California provides distribution services for the Johnny Was e-commerce operations. Our Lyons, Georgia distribution center provides primary distribution services for our smaller Southern Tide, TBBC and Duck Head businesses, as well as certain distribution services for our Lilly Pulitzer and Tommy Bahama businesses. 
Activities at the distribution centers include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to our retail store, e-commerce and wholesale customers, as applicable. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory at the distribution centers to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked, at-once and some in-stock replenishment orders for our wholesale customers. We use a local third party distribution center for our Tommy Bahama Australia operations.
In Fiscal 2022, 80% of our net sales were direct to consumer sales, which are filled on a current basis; accordingly, an order backlog is not material to our business. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
We believe that sophisticated information systems and functionality are important components of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses, particularly in the ever-changing consumer shopping environment. Our information systems are designed to provide effective retail store, e-commerce, food and beverage and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point-of-sale, distribution center, design, sourcing, order processing, marketing, customer relationship management, accounting and other functions. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies, to provide additional consumer access and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business. We believe that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency, functionality and reporting capabilities is critical to our operations and financial condition. We plan to increase our investment in information technology initiatives in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 levels which will result in increased capital expenditures and SG&A and decrease operating margin from the levels achieved in Fiscal 2022 in the near term but provide significant long term benefits to our business operations and financial success.
LICENSING AND OTHER DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS
We license certain of our trademarks, including the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer names, to licensees in categories beyond our brands’ core product categories. We believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for our larger lifestyle brands. Once a brand is more fully established, licensing typically requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In 

23



evaluating a licensee for our brands, we consider the candidate’s experience, financial stability, sourcing expertise and marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed licensed products with the brand image and our own products.
Our agreements with our licensees are brand specific, relate to specific geographic areas and have expirations at various dates in the future, with contingent renewal options in limited cases. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty payments based on specified percentages of the licensee’s net sales of the licensed products as well as certain obligations for advertising and marketing. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution.
​
We license the Tommy Bahama brand for a broad range of product categories including indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, beach chairs, bedding and bath linens, fabrics, leather goods and gifts, headwear, hosiery, sleepwear, shampoo, toiletries, fragrances, cigar accessories, distilled spirits, resort operations and other products. Third party license arrangements for Lilly Pulitzer products include stationery and gift products; home furnishing products; and eyewear.
In addition to our license arrangements for the specific product categories listed above, we may enter into certain international distributor agreements which allow third parties to distribute apparel and other products on a wholesale and/or retail basis within certain countries or regions. As of January 28, 2023, we have agreements for the distribution of Tommy Bahama products in the Middle East and parts of Latin America. The products sold by the distributors generally are identical to the products sold in our own Tommy Bahama stores. In addition to selling Tommy Bahama goods to wholesale accounts, the distributors may, in some cases, operate a limited number of their own retail stores. Additionally, we have arrangements for distribution of Johnny Was products in certain countries. None of our international distributor agreements are expected to generate growth that would materially impact our operating results in the near term.
SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS
Each of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. As a result, our quarterly operating results and working capital requirements fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Typically, the demand for products for our larger brands is higher in the spring, summer and holiday seasons and lower in the fall season (the third quarter of our fiscal year). Thus, our third quarter historically has had the lowest net sales and net earnings compared to other quarters. Further, the impact of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, our e-commerce flash clearance sales, wholesale product shipments, weather, acquisitions or other factors affecting our operations may vary from one year to the next. Therefore, due to the potential impact of these items and the September 2022 acquisition of Johnny Was, we do not believe that net sales or operating income by quarter in Fiscal 2022 is indicative of the expected proportion of amounts by quarter for future periods.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Our key strategy is to own brands that make people happy, and we recognize that successful execution of our strategy starts with people. We believe treating people fairly and with respect is key to long-term success and, more importantly, is simply the right thing to do.
As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 6,000 individuals globally, more than 95% of whom were in the United States. Approximately 70% of our employees were retail store and food and beverage employees. Our employee base fluctuates during the year, as we typically hire seasonal employees to support our retail store and food and beverage operations, primarily during the holiday selling season. None of our employees as of January 28, 2023 was represented by a union.

As part of our commitment to our people, throughout our brands and businesses, we provide employees with training, growth and development opportunities, including on-the-job training, learning and development programs, and other educational programs. Outside of the United States, we work with outside partners familiar with the local markets and laws to ensure our rewards are competitive within that jurisdiction and support employee well-being. 
Diversity & Inclusion
Our ongoing commitment to having the best people includes a commitment to equal opportunity. We believe in a diverse and inclusive workplace that respects and invites differing ideas and perspective. We have a number of

initiatives to ensure that our hiring, retention and advancement practices promote fair and equal opportunities across our workforce and ensure that we will have the best people in the industry to support our businesses going forward.
Our diversity and inclusion strategies begin at the recruiting stage, where we seek to attract and hire the most qualified candidates possible, without regard to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, genetics or other protected characteristics. We reinforce our values and goals through our Code of Conduct and other workplace policies, with an anonymous, confidential ethics hotline that allows our employees to voice concerns. We also seek to ensure that our pay and rewards programs and advancement opportunities are consistent with our culture of equality.
