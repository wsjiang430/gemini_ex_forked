ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Company Overview
Dell Technologies helps organizations build their digital futures and individuals transform how they work, live, and play. We provide customers with one of the industry’s broadest and most innovative solutions portfolio for the data era, including traditional infrastructure and extending to multi-cloud environments. Our differentiated and holistic IT solutions benefit our results and enable us to capture revenue growth as customer spending priorities evolve. 
Dell Technologies’ integrated solutions help customers modernize their IT infrastructure, manage and operate in a multicloud world, address workforce transformation, and provide critical solutions that keep people and organizations connected. We are helping customers accelerate their digital transformations to improve and strengthen business and workforce productivity. With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from the edge to the core to the cloud, and we are at the forefront of software-defined and cloud native infrastructure solutions. 
Dell Technologies operates globally in approximately 180 countries, supported by a world-class organization across key functional areas, including technology and product development, marketing, sales, financial services, and services. We have a number of durable competitive advantages that provide a critical foundation for our success. Our go-to-market engine includes a 31,000-person direct sales force and a global network of approximately 240,000 channel partners. We employ approximately 35,000 full-time service and support professionals and maintain approximately 2,200 vendor-managed service centers. We also manage a world-class supply chain at significant scale with approximately $77 billion in annual procurement expenditures and over 725 parts distribution centers. 
We further strengthen customer relationships through our financing offerings provided by Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (“DFS”) and our flexible consumption models, including utility, subscription, and as-a-Service models, which we continue to expand under Dell APEX. These offerings enable our customers to pay over time and provide them with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements. 
Vision and Strategy
Our vision is to become the most essential technology company for the data era. We help customers address their evolving IT needs and their broader digital transformation objectives as they embrace today’s multicloud world. We intend to execute our vision by focusing on two strategic priorities: 
•Grow and modernize our core offerings in the markets in which we predominantly compete
•Pursue attractive new growth opportunities such as Edge, Telecom, data management, and as-a-Service consumption models
We believe we are uniquely positioned in the data and multicloud era and that our results will continue to benefit from our durable competitive advantages. We intend to continue to execute our business model and position our company for long-term success while balancing liquidity, profitability, and growth and keeping our purpose at the forefront of our decision-making: to create technologies that drive human progress. 
The IT industry is rapidly evolving with demand for simpler, more agile solutions as companies leverage multiple clouds across their increasingly complex IT environments. To meet our customer needs, we continue to invest in research and development, sales, and other key areas of our business to deliver superior products and solutions capabilities and to drive long-term sustainable growth.
Business Model Transformation
Our customers are seeking new and innovative models that address how they consume our solutions. In part, customers are looking to remove unnecessary cost and complexity, align solution offerings to their business needs, and provide consistent operations throughout their IT enterprise. 
We offer options including as-a-Service, subscription, utility, leases, loans, and immediate pay models designed to match customers' consumption and financing preferences. We believe these options are particularly advantageous for our customers during times of economic uncertainty as they provide financial flexibility to further enable them to procure our solutions.
These offerings typically result in multiyear agreements which generate recurring revenue streams over the term of the arrangement. We expect that these offerings will further strengthen our customer relationships and provide a foundation for growth in recurring revenue. We define recurring revenue as revenue recognized that is primarily related to hardware and software maintenance as well as subscription, as-a-Service, usage-based offerings, and operating leases.
As we pursue our strategy of modernizing our core business solutions, we continue to evolve and build momentum across our family of as-a-Service offerings under Dell APEX. 
Products and Services
We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of IT solutions, products, and services. We are organized into two business units which are also our reportable segments, referred to as Infrastructure Solutions Group and Client Solutions Group.
•Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”) — ISG enables our customers’ digital transformation with solutions that address the fundamental shift to multicloud environments, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. ISG enables customers to simplify, streamline, and automate their cloud operations. ISG solutions are built for multicloud environments and are optimized to run cloud native workloads in both public and private clouds, as well as traditional on-premise workloads.
Our comprehensive storage portfolio includes traditional as well as next-generation storage solutions, including all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, hyper-converged infrastructure, and software-defined storage. We have simplified our storage portfolio and continue to make enhancements to our storage offerings that we expect will drive long-term improvements in the business.
Our server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, and tower servers. Our servers are designed with the capability to run high value workloads across customers’ IT environments, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and edge workloads. Our networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. 
Our strengths in server, storage, and virtualization software solutions allow us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, enabling our customers to accelerate their IT transformation with scalable integrated solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. ISG also offers software, peripherals, and services, including configuration, support and deployment, and extended warranties.
Approximately half of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan region (“APJ”).
•Client Solutions Group (“CSG”) — CSG includes branded PCs including notebooks, desktops, and workstations and branded peripherals including displays and docking stations, as well as third-party software and peripherals. CSG also includes services offerings, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranties. Our CSG offerings are designed with our customers’ needs in mind and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security.
Our commercial portfolio provides our customers with solutions centered around flexibility to address their complex needs such as IT modernization, hybrid work transformation, and other critical needs. Within our high-end consumer offerings, we provide our customers’ with powerful performance, processing, and end-user experiences. 
Approximately half of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.
Our “other businesses,” described below, primarily consists of our resale of standalone offerings of VMware, Inc. (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “VMware”), referred to as “VMware Resale,” and offerings of SecureWorks Corp. (“Secureworks”). These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively. 
•VMware Resale consists of our sale of standalone VMware offerings. Under our Commercial Framework Agreement with VMware discussed in this report, Dell Technologies continues to act as a key channel partner for VMware, reselling VMware’s offerings to our customers. This partnership is intended to facilitate mutually beneficial growth for both Dell Technologies and VMware.
VMware works with customers in the areas of hybrid and multicloud, modern applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces, helping customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multicloud, multi-device environments. 
•Secureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global cybersecurity provider of technology-driven security solutions singularly focused on protecting its customers by outpacing and outmaneuvering the adversary. The solutions offered by Secureworks enable organizations of varying size and complexity to prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity, respond rapidly when a security breach occurs, and identify emerging threats.
Our offerings are continually evolving in response to customer needs. As a result, reclassifications of certain products and services solutions in major product categories may be required. For further discussion regarding our reportable segments, see “Part II — Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Results of Operations — Business Unit Results” and Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
Dell Financial Services
DFS supports our businesses by offering and arranging various financing options and services for our customers globally. DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase or use of our product, software, and services solutions. We also arrange financing for some of our customers in various countries where DFS does not currently operate as a captive entity. We further strengthen customer relationships through flexible consumption models, including utility, subscription, and as-a-Service models, which enable us to offer our customers the option to pay over time to provide them with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements. DFS funded $9.7 billion of originations in Fiscal 2023 and maintains an $11 billion global portfolio of high-quality financing receivables. The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed and may be impacted by, among other items, changes in the interest rate environment and the translation of those changes to pricing. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
Research and Development
We focus on developing scalable technology solutions that incorporate desirable features and capabilities at competitive prices. We employ a collaborative approach to design and development in which our engineers, with direct customer input, design innovative solutions and work with a global network of technology companies to architect new system designs, influence the direction of future development, and integrate new technologies into our products and solutions. Through our collaborative, customer-focused approach to innovation, we strive to deliver new and relevant products to the market quickly and efficiently. 
Our software engineers are focused on developing the next generation of innovative solutions. Our software simplifies the complex through automation, increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology. Most of our research and development (“R&D”) expenditures represent costs to develop the software that powers these solutions. 
We manage our R&D spending by targeting those innovations and solutions that we believe are most valuable to our customers and by relying on the capabilities of our strategic relationships. We have a global R&D presence, with total R&D expenses of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.5 billion for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022, and Fiscal 2021, respectively. These investments reflect our commitment to R&D activities that ultimately support our goal to help our customers build their digital future and to transform IT.
Additionally, we invest in early-stage, privately-held companies that develop software, hardware, and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies. We manage our investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital.
Manufacturing and Materials
We own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See “Item 2 — Properties” for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand as part of our strategy to enhance our variable cost structure and to achieve our goals of generating cost efficiencies, delivering products faster, better serving our customers, and enhancing our supply chain. When using contract manufacturers, we purchase components from suppliers and subsequently sell those components to the manufacturer. Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers.
Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, software, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and processing of information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes our global sites and organizations that design, manufacture, and service our products. 
Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities are also certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard for quality management systems, the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems, the ISO 45001 International Standard for health and safety management systems, and the ISO 50001 International Standard for energy management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality, environmental, health and safety, and energy management are among the highest levels of certifications available. We also have implemented programs and methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships are continually improved. 
We maintain a Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner.
We purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on a single source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry — Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost” for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies’ use of single- or limited-source suppliers.
Geographic Operations
Our global corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. We have operations and conduct business in many countries located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions. To increase our global reach, we continue to focus on emerging markets outside of the United States, Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. We continue to view these geographical markets, which include the vast majority of the world’s population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets. For information about the amount of net revenue we generated from our operations outside of the United States during the last three fiscal years, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Seasonality
Our sales can be affected by seasonal trends. Within ISG, our storage sales are typically stronger in our fourth fiscal quarter. Our sales within the Americas are typically stronger in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, with sales in EMEA typically stronger during the fourth fiscal quarter. Historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by, and may continue to be impacted by, the COVID-19 pandemic, the changing macroeconomic environment, and our mix of business. 
Competition 
We operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. We face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer customers competitive, scalable, and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features at a competitive price. We closely monitor market pricing, including the effect of foreign exchange rate movements, in an effort to provide the best value for our customers. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers and channel partners allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs and other macroeconomic factors.
We also face competition from non-traditional IT companies, including large Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers, that often buy their infrastructure directly from original design manufacturers. Competitive pressures could increase if customers choose to move existing workloads to these Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers.
The markets in which we compete span countries around the world with customers that range from the world’s largest corporations to small and medium-sized businesses to consumers and also includes government and not-for-profit organizations. We believe that new businesses will continue to enter these markets and develop technologies that, if successfully commercialized, may compete with our products and services. Moreover, current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, which may further increase the competitive pressures. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry” for information about our competitive risks. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers. Our unified global sales and marketing team has created a go-to-market organization that is customer-focused, collaborative, and innovative. We generally organize our go-to-market operations with a focus on geographic and customer segments which encompass large global and national enterprises, public institutions that include governmental agencies, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. 
Go-to-market strategy — We sell products and services directly to customers and through other sales channels, which include value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We manage our many channels to offer a unified customer experience.
We believe our direct business model is a significant competitive advantage and emphasizes direct communication with customers, allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs and enabling us to successfully navigate environments with constrained supply chains. 
In addition to our direct business model, we use our network of channel partners to sell our products and services, enabling us to efficiently serve a greater number of customers. The Dell Technologies partner program contributes to the development of 
channel sales by providing appropriate incentives to encourage sales generation. We also facilitate access to third-party financing to help our channel partners manage their working capital. We believe that building long-term relationships with our channel partners enhances our ability to deliver a high-quality customer experience. During Fiscal 2023, our other sales channels generated approximately 50% of our net revenue. 
Large enterprises and public institutions  — For large enterprises and public institutions, we maintain a field sales force throughout the world. Dedicated account teams, which include technical sales specialists, form long-term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance, develop tailored solutions for these customers, position the capabilities of Dell Technologies, and provide us with customer feedback. For these customers, we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and accountability with dedicated account managers, special pricing, and consistent service and support programs. We also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeting federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as healthcare and educational customers.
Small and medium-sized business and consumers — We market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers through various advertising media. To react quickly to our customers’ needs, we track our Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty metric that is widely used across various industries. Net Promoter Score is a trademark of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. We also engage with customers through our social media communities on our website and in external social media channels.
Product Backlog
Product backlog represents the value of unfulfilled manufacturing orders and is included as a component of remaining performance obligations to the extent we determine that the manufacturing orders are non-cancelable. Our business model generally gives us the ability to optimize product backlog at any point in time, by such actions as expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders for products that have shorter lead times. We ended Fiscal 2022 with elevated backlog levels as a result of industry-wide constraints in the supply of limited-source components. During Fiscal 2023, we lowered our backlog levels across both CSG and ISG as supply positions improved and demand declined. 
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
As of February 3, 2023, we held a worldwide portfolio of 20,693 granted patents and 8,045 pending patent applications. We continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities.  The inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future offerings, computer systems, software products, manufacturing processes, and related technologies.  We also hold licenses to use numerous third-party patents.  Although we use our patented inventions and license some of them to others, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.  Our product and process patents may establish barriers to entry, and we anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will continue to be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry.
We have used, registered, or applied to register certain trademarks and copyrights in the United States and in other countries. We believe that Dell Technologies, DELL, Dell EMC, Alienware, and Secureworks word marks and logo marks in the United States are material to our operations.
We have entered into software licensing agreements with other companies. We also license certain technology and intellectual property from third parties for use in our offerings and processes, and license some of our technologies and intellectual property to third parties. 
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies and other governmental agencies. Such regulation includes the activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the European Union; the consumer protection laws and financial services regulation of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various U.S. governmental agencies; the export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Treasury; the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation; the health information privacy and security requirements of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the environmental, employment and labor, and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business. 
Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, performance, and safety regulations in all areas in which we conduct business. Product design and procurement operations must comply with requirements relating to materials composition, sourcing, radiated emissions, energy efficiency and collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of electronics products, including restrictions on mercury, lead, cadmium, lithium metal, lithium ion, and other substances. Operations may also become subject to new or emergent standards relating to climate change laws and regulations. The amount and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict. We were not assessed any material environmental fines, nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs, during Fiscal 2023.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and are also subject to export controls, customs regulations, economic sanctions laws, including those currently imposed on Russia, and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government. Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.
We are subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Dell Technologies is committed to driving human progress by putting our technology and expertise to work where it can do the most good for both people and the planet.  We recognize that all of our stakeholders — shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, and communities — as well as the environment and society, are essential to our business. 
Dell Technologies is committed to progressing towards the goals set forth in our plan for 2030 and beyond (our “2030 Goals”). Our 2030 Goals represent an extension of our purpose as a company — to create technologies that drive human progress. We are using these goals to build our impact strategies over the next decade. Our 2030 Goals have four critical areas of focus:
•Advancing Sustainability — We believe we have a responsibility to protect and enrich our planet together with our customers, suppliers, and communities. We continue to prioritize sustainability across our business ecosystem, valuing natural resources and seeking to minimize our impact. With the power of our global supply chain, Dell Technologies pursues the highest standards of sustainability and ethical practices.
•Cultivating Inclusion — We view diversity and inclusion as a business imperative that will enable us to build and empower our future workforce and we strive to cultivate inclusion for our team members, customers, and communities. It is essential that our workforce be fully representative of the diversity in our global customer base. Further, we believe that diversity of leadership increases innovation and ensures that company decisions reflect a wide variety of perspectives.
•Transforming Lives — We believe our scale, support, and the innovative application of our portfolio can play an important role in advancing fundamental human rights and addressing complex societal challenges, including improving health, education, and economic opportunities for the underserved. We endeavor to harness the power of technology to create a future that is capable of realizing human potential. 
•Upholding Ethics and Data Privacy — Ethics and privacy play a critical role in establishing a strong foundation for positive social impact. We are committed to ensuring that new talent and existing team members align with our ethical culture. We will continue to invest in our advanced privacy governance and risk-management technology and continue seeking to select, evaluate, and do business with third parties who share our level of dedication to ethics and privacy.
Dell Technologies measures progress against our 2030 Goals in our annually released reports available on our website.
Climate Change
At Dell Technologies, we believe that by addressing climate change, we are demonstrating our commitment to protect our planet and the community. We have a responsibility to manage the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our direct and indirect footprint, and technology plays an important role in this undertaking. We aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. 
Human Capital Management
We are a diverse team with unique perspectives, united in our purpose, our strategy, and our culture. Our goal is to ensure that employees of different backgrounds feel valued, engaged, and inspired to do their best work. Through our ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts, flexible working environments, training and development offerings, and health and wellness resources for our employees, we are striving to attract, develop, and retain an empowered workforce. We believe the success of our commitment is demonstrated through our employee tenure and recognition by Newsweek as America’s Most Loved Workplace of 2022 and by Forbes in its ranking of the 2022 World’s Best Employers.
As of February 3, 2023, we had approximately 133,000 employees, approximately 32% of whom were located in the United States. As a result of rapidly evolving macroeconomic conditions during Fiscal 2023, we took certain measures to reduce cost, including limiting external hiring. Further, subsequent to the close of Fiscal 2023, we announced to our employees reorganizations and other actions to align our investments more closely with our previously discussed strategic and customer priorities. These actions will reduce our employee population by approximately 5%. We are committed to supporting those impacted as they transition to their next opportunities. Despite these difficult decisions, we continue to make investments and focused efforts to develop and empower our employees and attract and retain talent. 
We seek to support our culture in four key focus areas: 
Diversity and Inclusion — At Dell Technologies, we believe diversity is power. Within our 2030 Plan, one critical area of focus — cultivating inclusion — highlights how our human capital resources are vital to our social impact and long-term success. Cultivating inclusion is a core component of our culture, and we believe that closing the diversity gap is critical to meeting future talent needs and ensuring that new perspectives reflect our global customer base. We are committed to equal employment opportunity for all and upholding ethics and integrity in all we do and will continue to pursue inclusive policies that support full-spectrum diversity. 
As of February 3, 2023, excluding employees of Secureworks, the overall representation of employees who self-identify as women was approximately 35%. Of our global people leaders, 29% self-identified as women. We define people leaders as employees in a management level or executive position. 
As of the same date, our U.S. employee base was composed of employees who self-identified with the following races and ethnicities: 63% as White or Caucasian; 15% as Asian; 10% as Hispanic or Latino; 6% as Black or African American; 2% with two or more races; and 1% with additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). Approximately 3% of our U.S. employee base did not self-report or specify race and ethnicity status. Of our U.S. people leaders, 12% self-identified as Hispanic or Latino or as Black or African American. 
As the composition of the workforce evolves, we recognize that companies embracing diversity and inclusion are experiencing greater innovation, productivity, engagement, and employee satisfaction. We are committed to increasing gender and ethnic diversity throughout Dell Technologies and, as part of our 2030 Plan, have goals focused on this objective. We seek to achieve the following diversity goals within our workforce (excluding employees of Secureworks):
•By 2030, 50% of our global workforce and 40% of our global people leaders will be those who self-identify as women. 
•By 2030, 25% of our U.S. workforce and 15% of our U.S. people leaders will be those who self-identify as Black or African American or as Hispanic or Latino. 
We seek to meet these goals by:
•building and attracting the future workforce by investing in innovative recruiting and hiring programs intended to attract the best talent possible and address the global technology talent gap; and
•developing and retaining our current team members through a supportive corporate culture focused on equity of access to career advancement and upskilling programs.
Achievement Through Learning, Development, and Total Rewards — We offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits package and strive to provide the best choice and value at the best cost. Our comprehensive rewards programs are designed to attract, reward, and retain high-quality talent and to inspire employees to be their best and do their best work for our customers and the growth of our business. We recognize and reward performance through awards aligned with business strategy and individual objectives while supporting team members’ mental, physical, and financial health, and promoting workplace flexibility and connection. Further, Dell Technologies’ focus on cultivating inclusion is an important component of our total rewards philosophy: We believe that equal pay is a business imperative and we are committed to it.
We provide a multitude of programs to support employees’ career growth and development through a centralized experience called “Build Your Career.” Through this program, we offer formal training options, individualized development programs and sponsorship, tools for 360-degree feedback, mentoring, networking, stretch assignments, and growth opportunities. Our tools and resources are designed to empower and inspire employees to direct their own career paths and build a portfolio of transferable skills for success in the technology industry. Our internal Career Hub supports employee growth by providing personalized development suggestions, such as mentors and job opportunities, that align with their skills and development goals. We are committed to building a diverse leadership pipeline with a broad spectrum of skills, including the ability to lead with integrity and inspire others. 
Balance and Wellness — Work flexibility is part of our culture and remains a significant priority for us. We have built tools and a culture that provide choice and flexibility to employees, the majority of whom work in a hybrid environment. Dell’s global Connected Workplace program allows eligible employees to choose from a variety of flexible work arrangement options that best meet their needs. This program provides technologies to support employees to excel and progress regardless of their physical location. 
We support our employees’ wellness through a comprehensive approach focused on mental, physical, and financial health, flexibility, and connection. We provide wellness resources to help employees and their families develop and sustain healthy habits. We further support employee wellness via regular communications, virtual live and on-demand educational sessions, counseling and support services, fitness and wellness challenges, voluntary progress tracking, and other incentives.
Connection and Engagement — We believe that employee feedback is an important part of our culture and how we drive our strategy. Through our annual Tell Dell survey, employees can confidentially voice their perceptions of the Company and our leadership, culture, and inclusiveness so that we can continue to improve the employee experience. We drive further employee engagement and connection through a variety of initiatives including, but not limited to, our team member listening strategy and our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”). We have a total of 13 unique ERGs that cultivate inclusion and bring many collective voices together for a greater business impact. Our ERGs also provide personal and professional development through networking opportunities, mentoring, volunteerism, and community involvement.
Human Rights
At Dell Technologies, upholding and advancing respect for the fundamental human rights of all people is core to our business strategy, purpose, and commitment to drive human progress and create a positive and lasting social impact. We believe everyone deserves to be treated equally with dignity and respect, and we are committed to responsible, ethical, inclusive, and sustainable business practices. We believe in winning with integrity, and we use training and technology to assist our team members in applying the principles of integrity and compliance as part of everyday business transactions, activities, and decisions. 
Supply Chain Resources
We manage our responsible business practices in one of the world’s largest supply chains, which involves hundreds of thousands of people around the world. We continue our efforts to drive responsible manufacturing through robust assurance practices, including human rights due diligence and environmental stewardship. We recognize that looking after the wellbeing of people in our supply chain is important and have set goals for our work in this area, including:
•providing healthy work environments;
•delivering future-ready skills development for employees in our supply chain; and
•continuing our engagement with the people who make our products.
We support supplier employees at all levels with training on key topics, including forced labor and health and safety, and we continue to work with suppliers to deliver training directly to employees via their mobile phones. Through this initiative, Dell Technologies covers the cost of developing training modules and shares training costs with suppliers who deliver them. 
Dell Technologies works to ensure that we and our suppliers manufacture our products responsibly, in part through our social and environmental responsibility assurance program. Through risk assessments and audits conducted under this program, we seek to monitor factories’ adherence to the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct. Audits are conducted by third-party auditors that have been trained and certified by the RBA. The audits cover topics across five areas: labor, including risks of forced labor and weekly working hours; employee health and safety; environment; ethics; and management systems. Through our audit program, we aim to identify and solve concerns in our supply chain, and seek continual improvements to address issues and enable suppliers to build their own in-house capabilities. We supplement our audits with targeted assessments of suppliers when we identify opportunities to drive further improvements.
Our supply chain sustainability progress is available through annual reporting on the social impact reporting page of our website.
