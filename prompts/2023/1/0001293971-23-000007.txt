Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially curative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases based on our proprietary lentiviral vector (“LVV”) gene addition platform. In 2022, following more than a decade of leadership in research and clinical development, we received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for two gene therapies: ZYNTEGLO® (betibeglogene autotemcel, also known as beti-cel) and SKYSONA® (elivaldogene autotemcel, also known as eli-cel). Both therapies were launched in the fourth quarter of 2022, and we emerged as a leading commercial gene therapy company. 
The FDA approved ZYNTEGLO for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with ß-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions on August 17, 2022. The FDA granted accelerated approval of SKYSONA to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in boys 4-17 years of age with early active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (“CALD”) on September 16, 2022. Prior to FDA approval, both ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA received unanimous favorable votes from the FDA’s Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee in June 2022. We intend to submit a biologics licensing application (“BLA”) to the FDA for our third gene therapy program -- lovotibeglogene autotemcel - also known as lovo-cel - requesting priority review of the treatment for patients 12 and older with sickle cell disease (“SCD”) with a history of vaso-occlusive-events. 
We estimate that approximately 22,000 patients living with ß-thalassemia, CALD and SCD in the United States may potentially be addressable by ZYNTEGLO, SKYSONA and, if approved, lovo-cel, with 20,000 of these patients estimated to have SCD, 1,300-1,500 estimated to have ß-thalassemia and 40 estimated to have CALD. 
In 2022, fiscal discipline remained a priority for us. Following a corporate restructuring in April 2022, we reduced operating expenses by approximately 30% with a strategic focus on near-term catalysts, while also leveraging opportunities to extend our cash runway, including the sale of two Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers (“PRVs”) granted upon the FDA’s approval of both ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA and completion of an equity financing in January 2023.
Our Platform 
We believe we have the largest and deepest ex vivo gene therapy data set in the industry, with more than 700 patient years of experience. We custom design each of our products and product candidates to address the underlying cause of disease by introducing a functional copy of a gene to patients’ own enriched hematopoietic stem cells ("HSCs"). In a rapidly advancing field, we have developed in-depth analytical methods to understand the safety of our LVV technologies, which are designed to deliver a sustained, lifelong response from a one-time treatment and to improve upon allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ("HSCT"), which carries significant limitations, including the ability to identify matched donors, risk of transplant-related graft-vs-host disease ("GVHD") and death, as well as to improve upon current treatment approaches used with patients not currently eligible to receive allogeneic HSCT.
Our Programs
ZYNTEGLO® (betibeglogene autotemcel)
On August 17, 2022, the FDA approved ZYNTEGLO, the first gene therapy for people with β-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. ZYNTEGLO is approved for patients of all ages and genotypes and offers patients a potentially curative benefit through the achievement of durable transfusion independence and normal or near normal total hemoglobin levels. 
β-thalassemia is a rare, genetic blood disease caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene and characterized by significantly reduced or absent adult hemoglobin production. Patients with the most severe form, sometimes called transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia or β-thalassemia major, experience severe anemia and lifelong dependence on regular red blood cell transfusions, a lengthy process that patients typically undergo every 2-5 weeks. Despite advances in treatment and improved transfusion techniques, transfusions only temporarily address symptoms of anemia and people with β-thalassemia who require regular transfusions have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality due to complications from treatment-related iron overload. Data from the Cooley’s Anemia Foundation indicate that the median age of death of patients with transfusion-
1


dependent β-thalassemia in the U.S. who died during the last decade was just 37 years. We estimate that there are approximately 1,300-1,500 individuals with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia in the U.S. 
ZYNTEGLO works by using LVV to add functional copies of a modified form of the beta-globin gene (βA-T87Q-globin gene) into a patient’s own HSCs, allowing them to make normal to near normal levels of total hemoglobin without regular red blood cell ("RBC") transfusions. The functional beta-globin gene is added into a patient’s cells outside of the body (ex-vivo), and the modified genes are then administered to the patient via infusion. The treatment process is comprised of several steps that may take place over the course of several months. 
Clinical Development Program
We believe we have the longest and most robust clinical program for β-thalassemia in the field of gene therapy. We are conducting, or have conducted, the following clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with β-thalassemia:
•HGB-207 was a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of beti-cel to treat patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia ("TDT") and non-β0/β0 genotypes. This study was completed in March 2022. Twenty-three patients were enrolled and completed dosing in the study, consisting of 15 adolescent and adult patients between 12 and 34 years of age at enrollment, and eight pediatric patients less than 12 years of age at enrollment. Age at enrollment ranged from four to 34 years old. To be enrolled, patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes had to have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the previous two years. All patients must have been eligible for HSCT, but without a known and available matched family HSCT donor. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of treated patients who achieved transfusion independence, defined as weighted average hemoglobin levels ≥9.0 g/dL without any RBC transfusions for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any time during the study after treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study were designed to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel on transfusion requirements and clinical events. Safety evaluations performed during the study included monitoring of laboratory parameters, frequency and severity of clinical adverse events, incidence of acute and/or chronic graft versus host disease, success and kinetics of platelet and neutrophil engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal predominance or leukemia. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then was invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•HGB-212 was a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of beti-cel to treat patients with TDT who have either a β0/β0, β0/IVS-I-110, or IVS-I-110/IVS-I-110 genotypes. This study was completed in November 2022. Eighteen patients were enrolled and completed dosing in the study, consisting of ten adolescent and adult patients between twelve and 34 years of age at enrollment, and eight patients less than twelve years of age at enrollment. To be eligible, patients must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the previous two years. All patients must have been clinically stable and eligible to undergo HSCT (but without a known and available matched family HSCT donor) and been treated and followed for at least the last two years in a specialized center that maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of treated patients who met the definition of transfusion independence, which was identical to the definition in our HGB-207 study. The secondary endpoints of this study were designed to measure the proportion of patients who meet the definition of transfusion reduction, which was defined as the reduction in volume of RBC transfusion requirements (in mL/kg) in the post-treatment time period of months 12 to 24 compared to the average annual transfusion requirement in the 24 months prior to enrollment, to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel on transfusion requirements post-treatment and clinical events. Safety evaluations performed during the study included monitoring of laboratory parameters, frequency and severity of clinical adverse events, incidence of acute and/or chronic graft versus host disease, success and kinetics of platelet and neutrophil engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal predominance or leukemia. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then was invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•HGB-204 was a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 1/2 clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in increasing hemoglobin production and the proportion of treated patients who meet the definition of transfusion independence. This study was completed in February 2018, and patients in this 
study were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol to assess safety and efficacy beyond the study follow-up period. Eighteen adults and adolescents were treated in the study. To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients were between 12 and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT and received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year in each of the two years preceding enrollment. The patients were also medically eligible for allogeneic HSCT. Efficacy was evaluated primarily by the production of ≥2.0 g/dL of hemoglobin A containing βA-T87Q-globin for the six-month period between 18- and 24-months post-treatment. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included RBC transfusion requirements per month and per year, post-treatment. Safety evaluations performed during the study included success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal predominance or leukemia. Subjects were monitored by regular screening. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months from time of consent and then was invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•HGB-205 was a proof-of-concept, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical study conducted at a single site in France to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in four patients with β-thalassemia that also enrolled patients with SCD. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months from time of consent and then was invited to enroll in LTF-303, a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years.
•LTF-303 is the long-term follow-up study for patients with β-thalassemia from our HGB-204, HGB-205, HGB-207, or HGB-212 studies who were treated with beti-cel once they complete the original study protocol’s follow-up period of approximately two years. Under LTF-303, patients will be followed for approximately an additional 13 years for a total of approximately 15 years post-treatment. 
The approval of ZYNTEGLO was based primarily on data from the phase 3 HGB-207 and HGB-212 studies and the long-term follow-up study LTF-303. 
Data from the phase 3 studies (HGB-207 and HGB-212) presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2022 demonstrated that 90.2% (37/41) of patients treated achieved transfusion independence as of the July 2022 data cut. Transfusion independence is defined as no longer needing red blood cell transfusions for at least 12 months while maintaining a weighted average total hemoglobin of at least 9 g/dL. Patients who achieved transfusion independence produced normal or near normal levels of total hemoglobin and demonstrated improvements in markers of iron overload and markers of ineffective erythropoiesis. Results in these patients were durable as of last follow-up. 
Data from all 63 patients treated across our β-thalassemia gene therapy clinical development program have generally continued to demonstrate sustained treatment effect and quality of life improvements in patients with β-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions following treatment with beti-cel up to 8 years post-treatment (n=3), across ages and genotypes. Based on testimonials collected at month 36 from patients who achieved transfusion independence, the ability to seek employment or be employed increased to 93% of patients (13/14) from 67% (10/15) at baseline. There was also a reduction in the number of absences from school compared with baseline (from 95% (18/19) of impacted patients to 50% (5/10)). In addition, at month 36, 81% (17/21) of patients reported improvement in physical activity, and 100% (20/20) reported that they felt they had benefited from undergoing treatment with beti-cel. 
Nineteen percent (12/63) of patients experienced ≥1 adverse event ("AE") considered related or possibly related to beti-cel; the most common beti-cel related AEs were abdominal pain (5/63 [8%]) and thrombocytopenia (3/63 [5%]). Veno-occlusive liver disease, observed in 11% (7/63) of patients, resolved after treatment. Three patients experienced acute events unrelated to their β-thalassemia that required packed red blood cell transfusions (phase 1/2, n=1; phase 3, n=2). No hematologic malignancies, insertional oncogenesis, or vector-derived replication competent lentivirus, was observed.
As part of the FDA approval, we are required to conduct a prospective, multi-center observational study (REG-501) which will evaluate the long-term safety of ZYNTEGLO, including the risk of secondary malignancies occurring after treatment with ZYNTEGLO in at least 150 patients.
SKYSONA® (elivaldogene autotemcel) 
On September 16, 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval of SKYSONA (elivaldogene autotemcel), also known as eli-cel, to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in boys 4-17 years of age with early, active CALD. The SKYSONA product label includes a boxed warning for the risk of hematologic malignancy. 
CALD is the most severe form of adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare X-linked metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which results in accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids ("VLCFAs") in plasma and tissues. CALD involves a progressive destruction of myelin, the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for thinking and muscle control. The disease, which primarily affects young boys, is associated with irreversible neurologic decline, including major functional disabilities such as loss of communication, cortical blindness, requirement for tube feeding, total incontinence, wheelchair dependence, or complete loss of voluntary movement. Nearly half of patients who do not receive treatment die within five years of symptom onset. Prior to the approval of SKYSONA treatment, effective options were limited to allo-HSCT, which is associated with the risk of serious potential complications including death, that can increase dramatically in patients without a human leukocyte antigen matched donor. 
Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene into the patient’s own HSCs via LVV. Following engraftment, we expect the transduced HSCs to differentiate into other cell types, including macrophages and cerebral microglia, which produce functional adrenoleukodystrophy protein ("ALDP"). We believe that the functional ALDP can then enable the local degradation of VLCFAs in the brain, which in turn can stabilize the disease by preventing further cerebral inflammation and demyelination that are characteristics of CALD. 
We have agreed to provide confirmatory long-term clinical data to the FDA as a condition of the SKYSONA accelerated approval, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. 
Clinical Development Program 
The approval of SKYSONA was based on data from our phase 2/3 study (ALD-102 (n=32)) and phase 3 study (ALD-104 (n=35)). 
Both open-label, single-arm studies enrolled patients with early, active CALD who had elevated very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) values, a Loes score between 0.5 and 9 (inclusive), and gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of demyelinating lesions. Additionally, patients were required to have a neurologic function score ("NFS") of ≤ 1, indicating limited changes in neurologic function. The efficacy of SKYSONA was compared to a natural history population. 
Per protocol, patients treated with SKYSONA were assessed using the NFS and monitored for the emergence of six Major Functional Disabilities ("MFDs") associated with CALD progression including loss of communication, cortical blindness, requirement for tube feeding, total incontinence, wheelchair dependence, or complete loss of voluntary movement. 
The accelerated approval of SKYSONA was based on an intermediate clinical endpoint of MFD-free survival. A post-hoc enrichment analysis in symptomatic patients assessed MFD-free survival from onset of symptoms (NFS ≥ 1) in SKYSONA treated (N=11) and untreated patients (N=7). SKYSONA treated patients had an estimated 72 percent likelihood of MFD-free survival at 24 months from time of first NFS ≥ 1, compared to untreated patients who had an estimated 43 percent likelihood of MFD-free survival. 
The most common adverse events (incidence [≥ 20%]) were mucositis, nausea, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, alopecia, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, constipation, pyrexia, diarrhea, headache and rash. Myelodysplastic syndrome ("MDS"), a hematologic malignancy, has developed in patients treated with SKYSONA in clinical studies and, as of March 2023, MDS had been diagnosed in three patients after administration of SKYSONA. The SKYSONA product label includes a boxed warning for the risk of hematologic malignancy.
Enrollment is complete and all patients have been treated in both studies; follow-up in ALD-104 is ongoing. All patients who complete 24 months of follow-up in studies ALD-102 or ALD-104 are encouraged to participate in a long-term follow-up study (LTF-304) to continue monitoring safety and efficacy outcomes in boys treated with SKYSONA through 15 years post-treatment. 
As part of the accelerated approval process with the FDA, we have post-marketing requirements to follow patients who received SKYSONA in studies ALD-102 and ALD-104 for a minimum of ten years to assess event-free survival or need for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In addition, as a post-marketing requirement, a long-term study is being conducted to assess the safety of SKYSONA and the risk of secondary malignancies occurring after treatment with SKYSONA. We plan to fulfill this latter post-marketing requirement through an observational study (REG-502) which will enroll at least 120 patients followed for 15 years who receive SKYSONA in the commercial setting, which will include studying the effectiveness and safety in 24 boys with more advanced early active CALD for at least five years who are newly treated with SKYSONA.
The eli-cel program was subject to a clinical hold beginning in August 2021, when we received the first report of MDS. On September 15, 2022, the FDA lifted the clinical hold, prior to the completion of its review, and approval, of the SKYSONA BLA.
Lovotibeglogene autotemcel 
We are developing (lovotibeglogene autotemcel), also known as lovo-cel, as a one-time treatment for patients with SCD, a serious, progressive and debilitating genetic disease caused by a single mutation in the beta-globin gene that leads to the production of abnormal sickle hemoglobin ("HbS"). HbS causes RBCs to become sickled and fragile, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vasculopathy and unpredictable, vaso-occlusive events ("VOEs"), requiring frequent hospitalization. In the United States, more than 100,000 people are believed to have SCD, and the median age of death for a person living with the disease is 45 years. One in four people living with SCD experience a stroke by age 45, and 75 percent of people living with SCD report difficulty completing daily tasks. 
We intend to submit a BLA to the FDA for lovo-cel requesting priority review of the treatment for patients 12 and older with SCD with a history of vaso-occlusive events. The BLA submission will be based on efficacy results from 36 patients in the HGB-206 Group C cohort and include a median of 32 months of follow up. We anticipate that the BLA submission will also include efficacy results from two patients with 18 months of follow up in the HGB-210 study. Efficacy endpoints in the clinical studies focused on the resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events (sVOEs) and VOEs, as well as globin response based on βA-T87Q expression, total hemoglobin and health related quality of life measures. A vaso-occlusive event was defined as an episode of acute pain with no medically determined cause other than a vaso-occlusion, including acute episodes of pain, acute chest syndrome, acute hepatic sequestration, acute splenic sequestration, and acute priapism. A severe vaso-occlusive event was defined as such an event leading to a visit to a hospital or emergency department lasting for at least 24 hours, at least two visits to a day unit or emergency department during a 72-hour period (with both visits requiring intravenous treatment), or an episode of priapism lasting more than 2 hours and resulting in a visit to a medical facility. 
Data from the August 2022 BLA data cut, which will be used for the BLA submission, showed similar rates of complete resolution of sVOE and VOE (97% and 90%, respectively) as previously published data from the Group C pivotal cohort of HGB-206 through 24 months of follow-up. Moreover, in such August 2022 data cut, maintenance of complete VOE resolution in the majority of patients through long-term follow-up, combined with stable production of HbAT87Q, suggest outcomes have remained durable effect. We anticipate that the BLA submission will also include safety data from 50 patients treated across the entire lovo-cel program, including six patients with ≥ 6 years of follow-up. 
We anticipate that the BLA submission will also include safety data as of August 2022 from 50 patients treated across the entire lovo-cel program, with 6 patients having ≥ 6 years of follow-up. The majority of adverse events in treated patients were attributed to underlying sickle cell disease or conditioning with busulfan. Nonserious adverse events related to lovo-cel included infusion reactions (hot flush and decreased blood pressure) in 2 patients (4%). Serious adverse events related to lovo-cel included anemia in 2 patients (4%) with alpha-thalassemia, and leukemia in 2 patients (4%), not resulting from insertional oncogenesis. Three of 50 patients (6%) died, 1 due to sudden cardiac death and 2 due to leukemia. Additional data from the BLA data package is anticipated to be published or presented at a medical congress in 2023. 
If approved by the FDA, we intend to launch lovo-cel using third-party commercial manufacturing facilities for both the vector and drug product, using a suspension lentiviral vector process. We believe this approach supports the potential commercialization of lovo-cel with a robust and scalable manufacturing process to meet patient demand. We have completed manufacturing of commercial drug product validation lots, and in December 2022 we submitted vector and drug product comparability analyses to the FDA, which included data from the HGB-210 study. In mid-February 2023, we received feedback from the FDA and subsequently submitted additional analyses supporting comparability of the proposed commercial process to the FDA, as further described below under "Manufacturing activities".
In December 2022, the FDA lifted a partial clinical hold on our clinical program for lovo-cel for patients under the age of 18, which had been in place since December 2021. 
Lovo-cel is designed to work by using LVV to add functional copies of a modified form of the beta-globin gene (βA-T87Q-globin gene) into the patient’s own HSCs, potentially allowing them to make normally functioning hemoglobin A and normal RBCs. The functional beta-globin gene is added into a patient’s cells outside of the body (ex-vivo), and the modified genes are then administered to the patient via infusion. The treatment process is comprised of several steps that may take place over the course of several months. βA-T87Q-globin is designed to become part of the hemoglobin that the patient produces and HbAT87Q reduces the sickling of red blood cells in patients and may serve as a distinct biomarker used to quantify expression levels of the 
transgenic beta-globin protein in lovo-cel treated patients with SCD. By reducing the amount of red blood cell sickling, we believe the risk of vaso-occlusive events in patients should be reduced. 
Lovo-cel has been granted Fast Track Designation for the treatment of SCD, Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of SCD, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy ("RMAT") Designation for the treatment of SCD, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of SCD by the FDA. 
Clinical Development Program 
We are conducting, or have conducted, the following clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lovo-cel in the treatment of patients with SCD: 
•HGB-206 is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States evaluating the safety and efficacy of lovo-cel. A total of 45 patients were treated with lovo-cel in this study across three treatment cohorts. Patients must have been at least twelve years of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with βS/βS, βS/β+ or βS/β0 genotype. Patients must have had recurrent severe VOEs and must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. We refer to patients treated in the HGB-206 study under the amended study protocol utilizing HSCs from peripheral blood after mobilization with plerixafor as patients in “Group C” (n=36) rather than utilizing HSCs collected via bone marrow harvest, as in Groups A (n=7) and B (n=2). A refined manufacturing process designed to increase vector copy number and further protocol refinements made to improve engraftment potential of gene-modified stem cells were used for Group B and Group C. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the percentage of patients with complete resolution of all VOEs, between six- and 18-months post-treatment, and the secondary efficacy endpoints for this study includes the percentage of patients with complete resolution of severe VOEs and globin response based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin. Safety endpoints includes monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to oligoclonality, or leukemia. Each patient remains on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and is then invited to enroll in LTF-307, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•HGB-210 is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site, phase 3 clinical study in the United States designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovo-cel in the treatment of patients with SCD, with a target enrollment of 35 pediatric and adult patients. Patients must be at least two years of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with βS/βS, βS/β+ or βS/β0 genotype. Patients must have recurrent VOEs and must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is complete resolution of VOEs, between six- and 18-months post-treatment, and the secondary efficacy endpoint for this study includes the percentage of patients with complete resolution of severe VOEs and globin response based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin. Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to oligoclonality or leukemia. Each patient remains on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and is then invited to enroll in LTF-307, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. Data from drug product manufactured at our commercial manufacturing facility for the HGB-210 study are included in the lovo-cel BLA submission to demonstrate analytical comparability and support validation of our commercial manufacturing process.
•HGB-205 was a proof-of-concept, single-center phase 1/2 study in France of three patients with SCD which also enrolled patients with β-thalassemia. Those with SCD must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea and have an additional poor prognostic risk factor (e.g., recurrent vaso-occlusive crises ("VOCs"), or acute chest syndrome). All patients must have been eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched sibling allogeneic HSCT donor. The primary objective of our HGB-205 study was to determine the safety, tolerability and success of engraftment of the drug product. The secondary objectives of the study were to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment on disease-specific biological parameters and clinical events. In the case of patients with TDT and SCD, this meant the volume of RBC transfusions, and for patients with SCD, it also meant the number of VOCs and acute chest syndrome in each patient, compared with the two-year period prior to treatment. Safety evaluations performed during the study included success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal predominance or leukemia/ 
lymphoma. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then was invited to enroll in LTF-307, a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy for an additional 13 years. 
•LTF-307 is the long-term follow-up study for patients with SCD from our HGB-205, HGB-206, or HGB-210 studies who were treated with lovo-cel once they complete the original study protocol’s follow-up period of approximately two years. Under LTF-307, patients will be followed for approximately an additional 13 years for a total of approximately 15 years post-treatment. 
Manufacturing activities
We have entered into multi-year agreements with external manufacturing partners to support our programs in the United States. We have multi-year agreements with SAFC Carlsbad, Inc. ("SAFC", a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma), and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (previously Novasep) in the production of LVV. We use an adherent cell culture process at SAFC to manufacture LVV for ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA. In addition, we have entered into multi-year agreements with Lonza Houston, Inc. to produce clinical and commercial drug product for ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA and Minaris Regenerative Medicine ("Minaris") to produce drug product for lovo-cel. We also rely on specialized third-party testing organizations to confirm the quality of LVV and drug product prior to their use in clinical trials and commercial sales.
Over the course of the clinical development program for lovo-cel, we transitioned the lovo-cel LVV manufacturing process from an adherent cell culture process to a suspension process in order to meet anticipated commercial demand and potentially lower our cost of goods. Additionally, we transitioned lovo-cel drug product manufacturing from a clinical manufacturing site to a commercial manufacturing site. Our registrational clinical study for lovo-cel (which we refer to as HGB-206 Group C) was supplied primarily with LVV manufactured with the adherent process and drug product manufactured at both our clinical and commercial manufacturing sites; however, we plan to commercially launch utilizing the suspension process and commercial drug product manufacturing, if approved. To support these changes in manufacturing, in December 2022 we completed planned analytical analyses to demonstrate comparability between the two processes. In mid-February 2023, we received feedback from the FDA regarding comparability of lovo-cel using the proposed commercial process. We have submitted additional analyses to address the FDA's questions. The FDA is reviewing the analyses prior to our submission of the BLA and we plan to move quickly to submit the BLA upon resolution of the FDA's comparability questions. Please see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Changes in our manufacturing processes may cause delays in our clinical development and commercialization plans" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 
We believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to oversee these contract manufacturing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions and commercialization efforts. For the treatment of patients with our drug product in the commercial setting following approval if and when received, we are collaborating with participating treatment centers in the United States, which we refer to as qualified treatment centers ("QTCs"), to be centers for collection of HSCs from the patient and for infusion of drug product to the patient. 
In 2022, we paused efforts to demonstrate comparability of using cryopreserved patient starting material versus fresh patient starting material for the manufacture of lovo-cel drug product to focus our resources on BLA approvals and product launches. We are evaluating plans to reinitiate and advance cryopreserved starting material. If these efforts are successful, including if cryopreservation is determined to be technically feasible and is approved by the FDA and implemented with respect to our lovo-cel program, we believe cryopreservation could (i) expand the patient population that our therapies could potentially serve by improving patient and QTC experience by reducing the number of mobilization cycles, and (ii) lower our cost of goods by reducing the need for multiple manufacturing runs per patient. 
Commercial operations 
Throughout the course of 2022, we established commercial capabilities by adding employees with established experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. 
Our commercial strategy centers on three key components: 
•A qualified treatment center network 
•Quality access and reimbursement 
•Patient support 
As of March 27, 2023, ZYNTEGLO is commercially available to patients in the US through a network of 12 QTCs (defined as having a signed services agreement). Each ZYNTEGLO QTC has been selected based on their expertise in areas such as transplant, cell, and gene therapy, and is trained to administer ZYNTEGLO. We expect to scale to between 40 to 50 centers by the end of 2023. Five commercial patient starts (which we define as patients who have had their cells collected) have occurred for ZYNTEGLO, as of March 27, 2023. Following cell collection, the patient’s cells are shipped to a manufacturing facility where they are transduced with the appropriate LVV and tested to ensure they meet stringent release specification criteria. They are then frozen and shipped back to the QTC where the patient receives treatment via IV infusion. It is estimated to take between 70 – 90 days from apheresis (cell collection) to when manufactured drug product is ready to be shipped back to the QTC for patient infusion. 
We have set a wholesale acquisition cost of $2.8M for ZYNTEGLO. To help enable timely and quality access for patients, we are offering payers an outcomes-based agreement, under which we will reimburse contracted commercial and government payers up to 80% of the cost of the therapy if a patient fails to achieve and maintain transfusion independence up to two years following infusion. All patients in ZYNTEGLO phase 3 studies who achieved transfusion independence have remained transfusion free as of March 2023. As of March 2023, more than 190 million US lives are covered by a favorable coverage policy for ZYNTEGLO. 
ZYNTEGLO commercial launch operations are expected to enable a smooth transition to a potential lovo-cel commercial launch if and when it is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with SCD. The planned QTC footprint is designed to rapidly reach SCD patients, and the established QTC ZYNTEGLO contract is expected to allow for a simplified activation process for lovo-cel. We estimate that 65% of SCD patients will live within 50 miles of a planned QTC at launch. 
SKYSONA is currently available through a network of three activated QTCs. Cell collection has been completed for two commercial SKYSONA patients as of March 2023 and on March 16, 2023 the first SKYSONA commercial infusion was completed. We believe payers recognize the value and urgency to treat these patients, and to date there have been no ultimate denials by payers for the therapy. We have set a wholesale acquisition cost of $3 million for SKYSONA. 
For our approved therapies, we have established mybluebirdsupport, a patient support program that provides education, insurance and treatment support using patient navigators. 
While we believe we have largely established appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure necessary for supporting our complex supply chain and commercialization activities, we expect that we may make additional targeted investments as we continue our efforts to build our network of qualified treatment centers, plan for the scale needed for the potential launch of lovo-cel, establish patient-focused programs, educate healthcare professionals, and secure additional reimbursement. 
The timing and conduct of our commercialization activities will be dependent upon regulatory interactions, marketing approvals if and when received for our therapies, and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. 
European withdrawal 
In August 2021, we announced our intent to wind down our operations in Europe and to focus on the US market. The decision to discontinue operations in Europe resulted from prolonged negotiations with European payers and challenges to achieving appropriate value recognition and market access for ZYNTEGLO for the treatment of β-thalassemia. Accordingly, we withdrew the regulatory marketing authorizations for SKYSONA and ZYNTEGLO from the European Union and withdrew our marketing applications for SKYSONA and ZYNTEGLO from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. We are continuing the long-term follow-up of patients previously enrolled within the clinical trial programs in Europe as planned but do not intend to initiate any new clinical trials in Europe for β-thalassemia, CALD or SCD. We maintain rights to all three therapies in all global markets and continue to consider options, including possible collaboration with third-parties, to attempt to bring our therapies to market outside the US. 
Intellectual property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally 
rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes, transgenes, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, genetically modified cells, processes to manufacture our lentivirus-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates. In connection with the wind down of our operations in Europe, we have decided to let certain non-U.S. patents and patent applications that we own lapse by ceasing further prosecution of certain pending ex-U.S. patent applications and not paying future maintenance fees for certain ex-U.S. patents when due. As of March 8, 2023, our patent portfolio includes the following:
•approximately 21 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively in-licensed from third parties, including 5 that are co-owned with MIT, related to LVVs and vector systems;
•approximately 115 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to LVV or drug product manufacturing and associated assays;
•approximately 7 patents or patent applications that we have non-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to LVV or drug product manufacturing; and
•approximately 8 U.S. patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to therapeutic cellular product candidates.
Our objective is to continue to expand our U.S. portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product candidates and manufacturing processes. Examples of the products and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below. See also “—License agreements.” From time to time, we also evaluate opportunities to sublicense our portfolio of patents and patent applications that we own or exclusively license, and we may enter into such licenses from time to time.
ZYNTEGLO and lovo-cel
The ZYNTEGLO and lovo-cel programs include the following patent portfolios described below.
•Pasteur Institute. The Pasteur patent portfolio contains patent applications directed to FLAP/cPPT elements and LVV utilized to produce ZYNTEGLO and lovo-cel. As of March 8, 2023, we had an exclusive license to one issued U.S. patent. We expect the issued composition of matter patent to expire in 2023 in the United States (excluding possible patent term extensions).
•RDF. The in-licensed patent portfolio from Research Development Foundation ("RDF") in part, contains patents and patent applications directed to aspects of our LVV that may be utilized to produce ZYNTEGLO and lovo-cel. As of March 8, 2023, we had an exclusive license (from RDF) to five issued U.S. patents related to our LVV platform. We expect the issued composition of matter patents to expire from 2023-2027 in the United States.
•MIT/bluebird bio. This co-owned patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications directed to certain specific compositions of matter for lentiviral beta-globin expression vectors. As of March 8, 2023, we co-owned four issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application. We expect the issued composition of matter patents to expire in 2023 (excluding possible patent term extensions). Further, we expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2023 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We note that we have an exclusive license to MIT’s interest in this co-owned intellectual property.
SKYSONA
The SKYSONA program includes the following patent portfolios described below.
•Pasteur Institute. The in-licensed Pasteur patent portfolio contains the patents and patent applications described above directed towards aspects of LVV utilized to produce SKYSONA.
•RDF. The in-licensed RDF patent portfolio contains the patents and patent applications described above directed towards aspects of LVV that may be utilized to produce SKYSONA.
•bluebird bio. The bluebird bio patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter for eli-cel vectors and compositions and methods of using the vectors and compositions in cell-based gene therapy of adrenoleukodystrophy or adrenomyeloneuropathy. As of March 8, 2023, we owned three U.S. patents and 7 issued foreign patents. We expect the issued composition of matter patents for eli-cel vectors to expire in 2032 (excluding possible patent term extensions). 
Lentiviral platform (e.g., LVV, manufacturing, and cell therapy products)
The lentiviral platform, which is potentially applicable across our programs in severe genetic disease, includes the following patent portfolios described below.
•Pasteur Institute. The Pasteur patent portfolio contains the patents and patent applications described above.
•RDF. The in-licensed RDF patent portfolio contains the patents and patent applications described above.
•SIRION. The in-licensed patent portfolio from SIRION Biotech GmbH ("SIRION") contains patents and patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing ex vivo gene therapy products with LVV. As of March 8, 2023, we had an exclusive license to three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, two corresponding foreign patent applications and 45 issued corresponding foreign patents. We expect the issued method patents to expire in 2033 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other composition of matter and methods patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2033 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2033 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
•bluebird bio. Another component of the bluebird bio patent portfolio includes LVV and drug product manufacturing platforms and is potentially applicable across our programs. This portion of the portfolio contains patents and patent applications directed to improved methods for transfection and transduction of therapeutic cells. As of March 8, 2023, we owned four issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications and seven corresponding foreign patent applications and 41 issued corresponding foreign patents. We expect the issued method patents to expire from 2032-2037 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect composition of matter and method patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2032-2037 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2032-2037 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
•2seventy bio. The 2seventy bio patent portfolios include LVV manufacturing platforms and improvements and are potentially applicable across our programs. As of March 8, 2023, we had a non-exclusive license to four patent families that include two pending U.S. patent applications, seven corresponding foreign patent applications, one pending PCT application, and one U.S. provisional patent application. We expect any composition of matter or methods patents, if issued from a corresponding nonprovisional application or national stage application, or corresponding foreign applications, if applicable, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2040-2042 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect any other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2040-2042 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United 
States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. Depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering lovo-cel and their methods of use.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License agreements
Inserm-Transfert
In May 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with Inserm-Transfert SA, referred to hereafter as “Inserm”, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale, for use of certain patents and know-how related to the ABCD1 gene and corresponding protein, for use in the field of human ALD therapy. The last patent in the Inserm licensed patent portfolio expired in February of 2016. 
We are obligated to pay Inserm a percentage of net sales as a royalty on any of our products that use the in-licensed intellectual property for the longer of the life of any patents covering the product or 10 years from first commercial sale. Any net sales of SKYSONA will be subject to this royalty which is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Inserm are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. 
We are required to use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and introduce them into the commercial market as soon as practical, consistent with our reasonable business practices and judgment in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We have assumed certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 
We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach or in the event the other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed with prejudice within 120 days after filing. In addition, Inserm may terminate the license agreement in the event that we cannot prove within 60 days of written notice from Inserm that we have been diligent in developing the licensed products and introducing them into the commercial market. 
Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the patent rights covered by the agreement or 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The license grant ceases in connection with any such termination. The longest-lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement expired in 2016. 
Institut Pasteur
We have entered into a license with Institut Pasteur for certain patents relating to the use of DNA sequences, LVV and recombinant cells in the field of ex vivo gene therapy and CAR T cell-based therapy in a range of indications, excluding vaccinations. This agreement was amended twice in 2012, again in 2013 and most recently in 2015. The Institut Pasteur licensed patent portfolio includes two U.S. patents. The issued patents have statutory expiration dates in 2022 and 2023. The license is exclusive for products containing human and non-human LVV. Institut Pasteur retains the right, on behalf of itself, its licensees and research partners, to conduct research using the licensed intellectual property. 
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For the first sublicense including a product targeting β-hemoglobinopathies (including β-thalassemia and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy), we must pay Institut Pasteur an additional payment of €3.0 million. If we receive any income (cash or non-cash) in connection with sublicenses for products targeting indications other than β-hemoglobinopathies (including β-thalassemia and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy), we must pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of such income varying from low single digits if the sublicense also includes licenses to intellectual property controlled by us, and a percentage of sublicense income in the mid-range double digits if the sublicense does not include licenses to intellectual property controlled by us. 
We are obligated to pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of net sales as a royalty on any of our commercialized products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which include ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA, and will likely include lovo-cel, if and when approved. This royalty varies depending on the indication of the product but in any event is in the low single digits. In addition, starting in 2016, we have been required to make an annual maintenance payment, creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. If the combined royalties we would be required to pay to Institut Pasteur and third parties is higher than a pre-specified percentage, we may ask Institut Pasteur to re-negotiate our royalty rates under this relationship. 
We are required to use all reasonable commercial efforts (as compared to a company of similar size and scope) to develop and commercialize one or more products in the license field and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals in respect of, and market the products in license field, if any. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations. We must report on our progress towards achieving these milestones on an annual basis. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time by sending Institut Pasteur 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party’s substantial breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Institut Pasteur may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and not dismissed within 60 days. 
Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the last licensed patents or five years after first market authorization of the first product, whichever occurs later. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain the right to manufacture, import, use and sell licensed products for a certain period of time post-termination. In addition, our ownership stake in certain jointly made improvements covered by the licensed patents would survive termination of the agreement. The longest-lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in 2023. 
Stanford University
In July 2002, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, referred to herein as Stanford, which we amended and restated in April 2012. Under this agreement, we are granted a license to use the HEK293T cell line for any commercial or non-commercial use for research, nonclinical and clinical development purpose and human and animal gene therapy products. 
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For each such sublicense we grant, we must pay Stanford a fee (unless the sublicense is to a collaborating partner, contract manufacturer or contract research organization). 
We are obligated to pay Stanford a percentage of net sales as a royalty on any of our commercialized products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which include ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA, and will likely include lovo-cel, when and if approved. This royalty varies with net sales but in any event is in the low single digits and is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage which is less than one percent. Since April 2013, we have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments. 
We may unilaterally terminate the agreement by giving Stanford 30 days’ written notice. Stanford may also terminate the license agreement if after 30 days of providing notice we are delinquent on any report or payment, are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize one or more licensed products, are in material breach of any provision or provide any false report. Termination of this agreement may require us to utilize different cell types for vector manufacturing, which could lead to delays. 
Absent early termination, the license will expire in April 2037. We may elect to extend the term for an additional 25 years so long as we have a commercial product on the market at that time and we are in material compliance with the license agreement.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In December 1996, we entered into an exclusive license with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referred to herein as MIT, for use of certain patents in any field. This license agreement was amended in December 2003, May 2004 and June 2011. The licensed patent portfolio includes at least 13 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date from in 2023. This license also has been amended to include a case jointly owned by MIT and us wherein we received the exclusive license to MIT’s rights in this case. MIT retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for noncommercial research purposes. 
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. In the event we sublicense the patent rights, we must pay MIT a percentage of all payments we receive from the sublicensee. This percentage varies from mid-single digits to low double digits. 
We are obligated to pay MIT a percentage of net sales as a royalty on any of our commercialized products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property which includes ZYNTEGLO and will likely include lovo-cel in the future, if and when approved. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one-percent. In addition, we make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which may be credited against the royalty payments. 
We are required to use diligent efforts to market licensed products and to continue active, diligent development and marketing efforts for licensed products during the term of the agreement. We have assumed certain milestones with respect to raising capital investment and regulatory progress. We must report on our progress on achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 
We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon six months’ notice to MIT. MIT may terminate the agreement if we cease to carry on our business, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment). In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain a right to complete manufacture of any licensed products in process and sell then-existing inventory. In addition, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license following such termination. With respect to jointly owned intellectual property, any termination would allow MIT to grant licenses to any third-party to such intellectual property, without our approval, unless a sublicensee was already in place, in which case, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license.
Research Development Foundation
In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license with Research Development Foundation, which we refer to as “RDF”, to use certain patents that involve LVV. The RDF licensed patent portfolio includes at least 31 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date between 2021 and 2027. RDF retains the right, on behalf of itself and other nonprofit academic research institutions, to practice and use the licensed patents for any academic, non-clinical research and educational purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. 
We are obligated to pay RDF a percentage of net sales as a royalty on any of our commercialized products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property which include ZYNTEGLO and SKYSONA, and will likely include lovo-cel, when and if approved. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced by half if during the following ten years from the first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends. 
RDF may terminate the agreement in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment) or in the event we become bankrupt, our business or assets or 
property are placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, we institute or suffer to be instituted any procedure in bankruptcy court for reorganization or rearrangement of our financial affairs, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if we or an affiliate or a sublicensee institutes any procedure challenging the validity or patentability of any patent or patent application within the licensed patents, the agreement will immediately terminate. 
Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until its expiration upon the later of there being no more valid claims within the licensed patents or the expiration of our royalty obligations on licensed products that are subject to an earned royalty, if such earned royalty is based on the minimum 10-year royalty period described above. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, RDF will grant our sublicensees a direct license. The longest-lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are in one U.S. patent currently expected to expire in 2027.
SIRION
In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with SIRION, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of manufacturing gene therapy products. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date in 2033. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. We are obligated to pay SIRION a percentage of net sales as a royalty on any of our commercialized products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property which includes ZYNTEGLO and will likely include lovo-cel when and if approved. These royalties are in the low single digits. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop one or more licensed products in the license field during the term of the agreement, and we must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $13.4 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to SIRION. SIRION may terminate the license in the event of our material breach upon notice and following an opportunity for us to cure the material breach. SIRION may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and are not dismissed within a specified period of time. Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the patent rights covered by the agreement. The longest-lived patent rights licensed to us under the Agreement are currently expected to expire in 2033.
Orchard Therapeutics Limited
In April 2017, we entered into a license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, which we refer to as GSK, pursuant to which GSK non-exclusively licensed certain of our patent rights related to LVV technology to develop and commercialize gene therapies for Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy, two rare genetic diseases. Effective April 2018, this license agreement was assigned by GSK to Orchard Therapeutics Limited. Financial terms of the agreement included an upfront payment to us as well as potential development and regulatory milestone payments and potential low single digit royalties on net sales of covered products.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products but any products that we commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of therapies and the commercialization of those therapies. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ therapies may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any therapy we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our therapies. 
These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any therapies that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapies that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over current standard of care. Depending on how successful these competitive efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our therapies. These efforts include the following:
Sickle cell disease — The current standard of care for the treatment of SCD in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions or hydroxyurea (a generic drug). In addition, patients treated with chronic blood transfusions often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload. We are aware of ongoing studies that continue to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in various populations. In addition, a limited number of patients with SCD receive allogeneic HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. There are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the tolerability and safety of allogeneic HSCT with less well-matched sources of donor cells, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. received FDA approval for and has launched Endari (L-glutamine) for the treatment of SCD. In addition to the FDA approved HbS polymerization inhibitor (voxelotor, Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.) and the FDA / European Medicines Agency approved antibody to p-selectin (crizanlizumab, Novartis). A number of different therapeutic approaches for the chronic treatment of SCD are under investigation targeting the various aspects of SCD pathophysiology, including: a pyruvate kinase receptor activator, mitapivat, in a phase 2/3 trial supported by Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; another pyruvate kinase receptor activator, FT-4202, in a phase 2/3 study supported by Novo Nordisk (though its subsidiary, Forma Therapeutics); and a selective small molecule inhibitor of ectoderm development protein designed to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin, FTX-6058, in a phase 1 study supported by Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. There are also several different gene therapy options in development for sickle cell disease. These include: CTX-001, which is being developed by CRISPR Therapeutics AG’s in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated with an ongoing phase 2/3 study and a rolling BLA submission in progress, and which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer; and Editas Medicine, Inc.’s ongoing phase 1/2 study for its EDIT-301, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing platform to target the HBG1/2 promoter to upregulate HbF. There are several other groups developing gene therapy approaches for SCD in early phases of development, including Beam Therapeutics and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. 
β-thalassemia — The current standard of care for the treatment of β-thalassemia in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions to address the patient’s anemia. In addition, such patients often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload associated with their chronic blood transfusions. Novartis and Chiesi, who provide the leading iron chelation therapies, are seeking to develop improvements to their product profile and accessibility. A number of different approaches are under investigation that seek to improve the current standard of care treatment options. Reblozyl (luspatercept), a subcutaneously-delivered protein therapeutic marketed by Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb that targets molecules in the TGF-β superfamily, has been approved in the United States for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with β-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions, and was approved in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia associated with β-thalassemia. Additionally, Agios is developing mitapivat for both transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, with two phase 3 studies in progress. Some patients with β-thalassemia receive HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. In addition, there are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT, or the tolerability and safety of haploidentical HSCT, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. There are also several different groups developing gene therapy options for β-thalassemia, including CRISPR Therapeutics AG (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) which is conducting an ongoing phase 2/3 study for its CTX-001, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer and for which a rolling BLA submission has been initiated. 
CALD — The current standard of care for the treatment of CALD is allogeneic HSCT. We understand that various academic centers around the world are seeking to develop improvements to allogeneic HSCT. Other possible treatments being investigated include Minoryx Therapeutics’ MIN-102 (leriglitazone), and Viking Therapeutics’ VK0214.
Government regulation
In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FD&C Act") and the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act") and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, purity, potency, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, 
import, export, reporting, record keeping, post-approval monitoring, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before marketing certain biological products, including our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices ("GLPs"), and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 
•approval by an institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial commences; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices ("GCPs") and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency or efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s good tissue practices ("GTPs") for the human cellular and tissue products; 
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs, where applicable. 
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, a proposed clinical protocol and investigator information, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
In addition to the IND submission process, under the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”), supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by 
institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. 
Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
•Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test, among other things, the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution, of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
•Phase 3. The biological product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA may also require, or sponsors may voluntarily decide, to continue evaluating patients in ongoing clinical trials to gather additional information regarding the long-term effects of any approved products. For example, the FDA recommends that sponsors of certain gene therapy clinical trials observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after initial receipt of the information. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend, or its data safety monitoring board may recommend suspension of a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for 
products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product candidate. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA") as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers of the PREA requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA's goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTP regulations applicable to the operations that it performs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products ("HCT/Ps") which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional 
information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, exemptions from PREA requirements and BLA user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the disease or condition for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different disease or condition for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same condition or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for a disease or condition broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, drugs and biological product candidates are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The product candidate sponsor may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA, and with regard to a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
A biological product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track designation features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. Moreover in 2017, the FDA established the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. An investigational drug is eligible for RMAT 
designation if: (1) it meets the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the investigational drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. In a February 2019 final guidance, the FDA also stated that certain gene therapies that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review of BLAs and priority review. 
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including those receiving Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation or RMAT designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved would provide a significant improvement safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of the FDA's determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, such as an intermediate endpoint, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical studies. Failure to conduct required confirmatory trials in a timely manner, or to verify a clinical benefit during such confirmatory trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the approved biologic product from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-submission of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, RMAT designation priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-approval requirements
Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. Manufacturers of approved products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved 
product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug or biological products or that hold approved BLAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly-discovered safety issue. 
Manufacturers must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising and advertising to healthcare professionals, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. Consequences could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. patent term restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act") signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the "BPCIA") which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA 
for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Healthcare Laws 
In addition to restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state/ federal laws and trade association membership codes of conduct have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals. 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging healthcare professionals or patients as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. 
The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The U.S. federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, certain non-physician 
practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. A number of other countries, states and municipalities have also implemented additional payment tracking and reporting requirements, which if not done correctly may result in additional penalties.
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. In many other countries, healthcare professionals who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by government entities, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities. Our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing information. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
Violations of any of these laws or other applicable governmental regulations may result in significant penalties, including civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if the government requires a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement 
Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. Third-party payers can include government healthcare systems, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Moreover, these processes vary in length and may take several weeks, months, or longer to conclude depending on the individual payer. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative 
treatments to be tried first. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety, efficacy, and overall value. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
We have proposed novel payment models, including outcomes-based contracts and the option for payers to pay in installments over time, to assist with realizing the value and sharing the risk of a potential one-time treatment, such as for ZYNTEGLO. While we have signed outcomes-based contracts with several pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) representing dozens of downstream insurance plans and are engaged in discussions with additional PBMs and national payers, there is no assurance that these payment models will be widely adopted. Even with these payment models, there may be substantial resistance to the cost of our products by payers and the public generally. These payment models may not be sufficient for payers to grant coverage, and if we are unable to obtain adequate coverage for our products, the adoption of our products and access for patients may be limited. In addition, to the extent reimbursement for our products is subject to outcomes-based arrangements, our future revenues from product sales will be more at risk (though based on the structure of our contracts, this risk is quantifiable and relatively predictable). These factors could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Government Price Reporting
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government covering individuals aged 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. We are enrolled in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”). Under the MDRP, as a condition of federal funds being made available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and for certain drugs or biologicals under Medicare Part B, we pay a rebate to state Medicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and paid for by the state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare programs. For the MDRP, these data include the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for each drug and, in the case of innovator products, best price. In connection with Medicare Part B, a pharmaceutical manufacturer must provide CMS with average sales price (“ASP”) information for certain drugs or biologicals on a quarterly basis. ASP is calculated based on a statutorily defined formula, as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. This information is used to compute Medicare Part B payment rates, which consist of ASP plus a specified percentage. If we become aware that our MDRP price reporting submission for a prior period was incorrect or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the revised data for up to three years after those data originally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions, including termination from the MDRP, in which case payment would not be available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid or, if applicable, Medicare Part B.
Federal law requires that a manufacturer that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program (the “340B program”) in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) and requires us, as a participating manufacturer, to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs when used in an outpatient setting. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health 
Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low income patients. A drug that is designated for a rare disease or condition by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not subject to the 340B ceiling price requirement with regard to the following types of covered entities: rural referral centers, sole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and free standing cancer hospitals. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA publishes them to 340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities for 340B eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through which 340B covered entities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges, and through which manufacturers may pursue claims against 340B covered entities for engaging in unlawful diversion or duplicate discounting of 340B drugs. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program, such as adding further covered entities or requiring participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
In order to be eligible to have drug products paid for with federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we must also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. Under the VA/FSS program, we must report the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no more than the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula. These four agencies are the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service). We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If we fail to provide timely information or are found to have knowingly submitted false information, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties.
Individual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are considering implementation of drug price transparency legislation. Requirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states may impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers who fail to comply with drug price transparency requirements.
Healthcare Reform and Potential Changes to Healthcare Laws
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended manufacturer Medicaid rebate obligations to utilization by individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. More recently, in March 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which eliminates the statutory cap on the Medicaid drug rebate, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. 
Most significantly, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law. This statute marks the most significant action by Congress with respect to the pharmaceutical industry since adoption of the ACA in 2010. 
Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, and while the impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined, it is likely to be significant.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug and biologic pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs and biologics under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governments and third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services.
COVID-19
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted a hybrid work environment for our office staff. Our laboratory staff have some flexibility to work remotely; however, their core job functions require physical presence at our laboratory location to perform the duties of their roles. Further, we continue to evaluate any impact of COVID-19 on our business, including but not limited to our QTC network, our supply chain, and any potential future clinical trials. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2022 financial results.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and any potential resurgence; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Human capital
As of January 31, 2023, we had 323 full-time employees, 47 of whom have Ph.D., M.D. or Pharm.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 199 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 124 employees are engaged in commercial, finance, legal, business development, human resources, information technology, facilities and other general administrative functions. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We are an organization committed to creating an inclusive and engaged culture that meets the needs of the whole employee, through competitive total rewards and retention efforts and commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging. 
Compensation and benefits programs
Our compensation programs are designed to align our employees' interests with the drivers of growth and stockholder returns by supporting the Company's achievement of its primary business goals. Our goal is to attract and retain employees whose talents, expertise, leadership, and contributions are expected to sustain growth and drive long-term stockholder value. Consequently, we provide employee wages and benefits that are competitive within our industry, and we engage a nationally-recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. Through our pay-for-performance culture, we seek to align our employees' interests with those of stockholders by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall 
Company performance is intended to align the employee’s financial interests with the interests of stockholders. We are also committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. All employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) plan, and group life and disability coverage. 
Employee development and training
The development, recruitment and retention of our employees is a critical success factor for our company. To ensure we provide a meaningful experience for our employees, we regularly measure organizational culture and engagement, to build on the competencies that are important for our future success. We are building a robust talent and succession planning process and have established programs to support the talent pipeline for critical roles throughout our organization, to help us identify, foster, and retain high performing employees. To empower our employees to realize their potential at bluebird, we provide a range of development programs, opportunities and resources they need to be successful, to improve performance and retention, increase our organizational learning and support the promotion of our current employees. 
Diversity
We believe Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging ("DEIB") are the cornerstone to an engaged, successful, and innovative organization. We are committed to taking action to help address racial injustice and inequality. We established our DEIB steering committee that includes employees at all levels to provide oversight and guidance to establishing meaningful measures and actions to continue to increase DEIB at all levels and experiences. With significant input from employees and leaders at bluebird, we have adopted corporate goals to increase diversity and representation across our employee population.
