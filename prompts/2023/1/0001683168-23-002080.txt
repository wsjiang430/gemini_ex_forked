Company Mission
 
Our mission is to protect our investors through a diversified asset base with various asset classes that allow it to stay liquid and self-sufficient. A diverse balance sheet also helps to head off any unforeseeable market shifts and political changes around the globe, which are critically important in uncertain times. Our new team of experienced leaders have created an exciting vision that is still in the early stages of redevelopment and growth, yet one that promises to offer investors an opportunity to take part in an exciting journey right from the start.
Business Objective
 
The principal business objective is to generate revenue through strategic partnerships and joint ventures that focus on income generation coupled with capital preservation through proactive portfolio management utilizing a conservative liquidity and investment posture to optimize returns to our shareholders. We achieve this vision through prudent management of borrowed funds together with our capital and shareholders’ equity that is invested primarily in a diversified balance sheet of real estate investments and fixed-income that earns the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. The business is financed by an appropriate mix of shareholders’ equity and the sale of corporate debt to achieve its primary business objective of an annual return on equity greater than its cost of equity, while maintaining a sound financial structure. This is achieved by rigorous due diligence to vet assets and investments that have significant upside potential while minimizing risks through an investment strategy that pursues an “absolute return” or positive returns to preserve investor capital and returns to our shareholders. We believe that our business objectives are supported through our long-term conservative financial vision, the diversity of our investment strategy and comprehensive risk management approach to preserve investor capital for our shareholders.
 
Fixed-Income Strategy
 
This strategy enables the company to maximize profitability by taking advantage of different market cycles, while diversifying risk. The company’s investment objective is to generate consistent capital appreciation over the long-term, with relatively low volatility with the pursuit of an “absolute return” or seeking to achieve positive returns, by, for example, taking long and short positions and by engaging in various hedging strategies, regardless of the performance of the traditional equity and fixed income markets. Additionally, from time to time, the company may use derivative instruments, such as total return swaps or other structured products and may invest, to a limited extent, in registered investment companies, including exchange-traded funds.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

· | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.
