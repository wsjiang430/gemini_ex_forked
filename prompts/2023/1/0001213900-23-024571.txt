General Corporate History



Bio Essence Corp. (“we,” “us,” “Bio Essence,” or the “Company”) is an herbal health, diet, and nutrition company. The Company’s mission is to provide herbal health, diet, and vitamin nutritional supplements through three (3) operational subsidiaries, as explained below.



The Company was incorporated in the State of California on January 1, 2000. On January 27, 2016, the Company entered into a change of control whereby our controlling shareholder, Jian Yang, purchased a controlling interest in the Company. On that same date, Jian Yang entered into a stock purchase agreement with Fusion Diet Systems, Inc. a Utah corporation dba, Fusion Naturals (“Fusion Naturals”). Fusion Naturals was originally incorporated in Utah on April 20, 2010. On January 9, 2017, the Company created a new corporation in the State of California called Bio Essence Pharmaceutical, Inc. to serve as a health supplements manufacturer (“BEP”). Then, on January 12, 2017, the Company created its third subsidiary, Bio Essence Herbal Essentials Inc. (“BEH”). The Company serves as a holding corporation for these subsidiaries. On November 13, 2021, the Company dissolved Fusion Naturals and formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, McBE Pharma, Inc. (“McBE”).



The primary focus of BEH is producing products for BEE and McBE, along with providing original equipment manufacturing and private label services to other companies. BEE targets and develops traditional Chinese medicines (“TCM”) in the form of single herbs, granules, pills, and tablets. It also offers special formulated dietary supplements and medical food. The Company intends to develop this subsidiary into one that is engaged in integrated health and to provide its customers to interact with dietitians, nutraceutical practitioners, and traditional integrative wellness doctors worldwide. McBE is in the process of implementing a new business plan that focuses on developing pharmaceuticals, supplements, and other similar products.



The Company sells its products through channels such as TCM practitioners, online websites, including its own proprietary website, and brick-and-mortar stores, such as GNC. Material sales have been made through these channels.

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.



As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
