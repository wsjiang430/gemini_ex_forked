GENERAL
 
Table Trac, Inc. (the “Company”, “Table Trac”, "we" or "our") is a Nevada corporation, formed on June 27, 1995, with principal offices in Minnetonka, Minnesota. The Company’s corporate website address is www.casinotrac.com.  The Company makes available free of charge, on or through the Company’s website https://www.casinotrac.com/investors/, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The Company has developed and patented (U.S. patent # 5,957,776) a proprietary information and management system (called our “Table Trac” system) that automates and monitors the operations of casino table game operations. In addition to its table games management system, Table Trac has been adding functionality to related casino system modules for guest rewards and loyalty club, marketing analysis, guest service, promotions, administration / management, vault / cage management and audit / accounting tasks. Aggregated together, all of these modules have become the “Casino Trac” product, a full-featured Casino Management System (CMS) offering what we believe to be a powerful combination of value, efficiency and reliability for casinos seeking to add or upgrade their casino management systems.
 
The Company sells and leases systems and technical support to casinos. The open architecture of the Table Trac system is designed to provide operators with a scalable and flexible system that can interconnect and operate with most third-party software or hardware. Key products and services include modules designed to drive player tracking programs and kiosk promotions, as well as vault and cage controls. The Company’s systems are designed to meet strict auditing, accounting and regulatory requirements applicable to the gaming industry. The Company has developed a patented, real-time system that automates and monitors the operations of casino gaming tables. The Company continues to increase its market share by expanding its product offerings to include new system features, and ancillary products.

COMPETITION
 
There is intense competition in the gaming management and gaming products industry which is characterized by dynamic customer demand and rapid technological advances. Today, there are many systems providers in the U.S. and abroad offering casinos and gaming operators “total solution” casino management and table games management systems. As a result, the Company must continually adapt its approach and its products to meet this demand and match technological advances and, if it cannot do so, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
The gaming and lottery industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation that customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
 
While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to impact the economy and may adversely affect our business. As of the date of this filing, uncertainty exists concerning the duration of the pandemic.  The pandemic may shift industry demand for installing and replacing existing casino management systems, impact sales and gross margins in the future, limit our ability to secure products we sell due to supplier and manufacturer shortages, limit the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic and local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home, limit the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers, limit the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services, and limit the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.
 
While we are unable to predict the nature, scope or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
 
To ensure that our business can continue to operate during this uncertain time, in February 2021 we applied and were approved for a second Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan through the Small Business Administration. This loan allowed us to continue to employ all existing employees to service our client base.
 
In March 2021, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) released Notice 2021-20, which retroactively eliminated the restriction that prevented employers who received a PPP loan from qualifying for the Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. Upon determination that the employer has complied with all of the conditions required to receive the credit, a receivable was recorded and the credit reduced salaries and wages expense. The ERC was repealed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and therefore the Company did not receive ERC funds for the fourth quarter of 2021. For the year ending December 31, 2021, approximately $523,000 was recognized as an offset to expenses in the statement of operations for the ERC.
 
With respect to liquidity, we are continually evaluating and taking actions to reduce costs and spending across our organization. This includes reducing hiring activities, adjusting pay programs, and limiting discretionary spending.
 
While we are unable to predict the nature, scope or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
