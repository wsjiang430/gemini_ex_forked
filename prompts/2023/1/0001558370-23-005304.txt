Our Business Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need. We maintain two active business segments: Specialized BioTherapeutics and Public Health Solutions.
Our Specialized BioTherapeutics business segment is developing and moving toward potential commercialization of HyBryte™ (a proposed proprietary name of SGX301 or synthetic hypericin), a novel photodynamic therapy (“PDT”), utilizing topical synthetic hypericin activated with safe visible light for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”). With a successful Phase 3 study completed, regulatory approval is being sought and commercialization activities for this product candidate are being advanced initially in the U.S. Development programs in this business segment also include expansion of synthetic hypericin (SGX302) into psoriasis, our first-in-class innate defense regulator (“IDR”) technology, dusquetide (SGX942) for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including oral mucositis in head and neck cancer, and proprietary formulations of oral beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate (“BDP”) for the prevention/treatment of gastrointestinal (“GI”) disorders characterized by severe inflammation including pediatric Crohn’s disease (SGX203). 
Our Public Health Solutions business segment includes active development programs for RiVax®, our ricin toxin vaccine candidate and SGX943, our therapeutic candidate for antibiotic resistant and emerging infectious disease and our vaccine programs targeting filoviruses (such as Marburg and Ebola) and CiVax™, our vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2). The development of our vaccine programs incorporates the use of our proprietary heat stabilization platform technology, known as ThermoVax®. To date, this business segment has been supported with government grant and contract funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (“DTRA”).
An outline of our business strategy follows:

● | Following positive primary endpoint results for the Phase 3 FLASH (Florescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) clinical trial of HyBryte™ in CTCL as well as further statistically significant improvement in response rates with longer treatment (18 weeks compared to 12 and 6 weeks of treatment), meet with the United States (“U.S.”) Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to discuss the contents of a refusal to file (“RTF”) letter recently issued by the FDA in response to the HyBryte™ new drug application (“NDA”) for the treatment of CTCL. We are preparing for a meeting, categorized as Type A, with the FDA to clarify and respond to the issues identified in the RTF letter and to seek additional guidance concerning information that the FDA would require for a resubmitted NDA to be deemed acceptable to file, in order to advance HyBryte™ towards marketing approval and U.S. commercialization while continuing to explore ex-U.S. partnership.

Specialized BioTherapeutics Overview
Synthetic Hypericin 
Synthetic Hypericin is a potent photosensitizer that is topically applied to skin lesions, taken up by cutaneous T-cells and then activated by safe visible light. Hypericin is also found in several species of Hypericum plants, although this active moiety is chemically synthesized by a proprietary manufacturing process and not extracted from plants. Importantly, hypericin is optimally activated with visible light thereby avoiding the negative consequences of ultraviolet (“UV”) light. Other light therapies using UVA or UVB light can result in serious adverse effects including secondary skin cancers. 
Combined with photoactivation, in clinical trials synthetic hypericin has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative effects on activated normal human lymphoid cells and inhibited growth of malignant T-cells isolated from CTCL patients. In both settings, it appears that the mode of action is an induction of cell death in a concentration as well as a light dose-dependent fashion. These effects appear to result, in part, from the generation of singlet oxygen during photoactivation of hypericin.
Synthetic hypericin is one of the most efficient known generators of singlet oxygen, the key component for phototherapy. The generation of singlet oxygen induces necrosis and apoptosis in adjacent cells. The use of topical synthetic hypericin coupled with directed visible light results in generation of singlet oxygen only at the treated site. We believe that the use of visible light (as opposed to cancer-causing UV light) is a major advance in photodynamic therapy. In a small published Phase 1/2 proof of concept pilot clinical study using synthetic hypericin twice weekly for six weeks, statistically significant efficacy was demonstrated in patients with CTCL (58.3% response, p=0.04) and psoriasis (80% response, p<0.02). Subsequently, a pivotal Phase 3 study in CTCL has further confirmed the biological efficacy of synthetic hypericin (termed HyBryte™ in the context of CTCL).
HyBryte™ – for Treating Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma
HyBryte™ is a novel, first-in-class, PDT, that utilizes safe visible light for activation. The active ingredient in HyBryte™ is synthetic hypericin, a photosensitizer which is topically applied to skin lesions and then activated by visible fluorescent light 16 to 24 hours later. 
Based on the positive and previously published Phase 1/2 results, we initiated our pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL during December 2015 and completed the trial in 2020. This trial, referred to as the “FLASH” (Fluorescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) study, aimed to evaluate the response to HyBryte™ as a skin directed therapy to treat early stage CTCL. We completed the study with approximately 35 CTCL centers across the U.S. participating in this pivotal trial. The Phase 3 protocol was a highly powered, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that enrolled 169 subjects (166 evaluable). The trial consisted of three treatment cycles, each of eight weeks duration. Treatments were administered twice weekly for the first six weeks and treatment response was determined at the end of the eighth week. In the first treatment cycle, approximately 66% of subjects received HyBryte™ and 33% received placebo

treatment of their index lesions. In the second cycle, all subjects received HyBryte™ treatment of their index lesions, and in the third cycle, all subjects received HyBryte™ treatment of all of their lesions. The majority of subjects enrolled elected to continue into the third optional, open-label cycle of the study. Subjects were followed for an additional six months after their last evaluation visit. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed on the percentage of patients in each of the two treatment groups (i.e., HyBryte™ and placebo) achieving a partial or complete response of the treated lesions, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the total Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (“CAILS”) score for three index lesions at the Cycle 1 evaluation visit (Week 8) compared to the total CAILS score at baseline. Secondary endpoints for the trial included the duration of responses, the extent of the regression of the tumors, and the safety of the treatment. We continue to work closely with the Cutaneous Lymphoma Foundation, as well as the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
Positive primary endpoint analysis for the Phase 3 study for HyBryte™ was completed in March 2020. The study enrolled 169 patients (166 evaluable) randomized 2:1 to receive either HyBryte™ (116 patients) or placebo (50 patients) and demonstrated a statistically significant treatment response (p=0.04) in the CAILS primary endpoint assessment at 8 weeks for Cycle 1. A total of 16% of the patients receiving HyBryte™ achieved at least a 50% reduction in their index lesions compared to only 4% of patients in the placebo group at 8 weeks. HyBryte™ treatment in the first cycle was safe and well tolerated.
Analysis of the second open-label treatment cycle (Cycle 2) was completed in April 2020, showing that continued treatment with HyBryte™ twice weekly for an additional 6 weeks (12 weeks total) increased the positive response rate to 40% (p<0.0001 compared to placebo and p<0.0001 compared to 6-weeks treatment). After the subsequent additional 6-week treatment, the response rate in patients receiving a total of 12 weeks treatment increased two and a half-fold. Treatment responses were assessed at Week 8 (after 6 weeks of treatment) and at Week 16 (after 12 weeks of treatment). A positive response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the CAILS score for the three index lesions evaluated in both Cycles 1 and 2. The data continued to indicate that HyBryte™ was safe and well tolerated.
Analysis of the optional third open-label treatment cycle (Cycle 3) was completed in October 2020. Cycle 3 was focused on safety and all patients could elect to receive HyBryte™ treatment of all their lesions for an additional 6 weeks or up to 18 weeks in total. Of note, 66% of patients elected to continue with this optional safety cycle of the study. Of the subset of patients that received HyBryte™ throughout all three cycles of treatment (18 weeks), 49% of them demonstrated a treatment response (p=0.046 vs. patients completing 12 weeks of HyBryte™ treatment in Cycle 2; p<0.0001 vs. patients receiving placebo in Cycle 1). Moreover, in a subset of patients evaluated in this cycle, it was demonstrated that HyBryte™ is not systemically available, consistent with the general safety of this topical product observed to date. At the end of Cycle 3, HyBryte™ continued to be well tolerated despite extended and increased use of the product to treat multiple lesions.
In addition, continued analysis of results from the protocol mandated efficacy cycles (Cycles 1 and 2) of the study revealed that 12 weeks of treatment (Cycle 2) with HyBryte™ is equally effective on both patch (response 37%, p=0.0009) and plaque (response 42%, p<0.0001) lesions when compared to Cycle 1 placebo lesion responses, further demonstrating the unique benefits of the more deeply penetrating visible light activation of hypericin.
HyBryte™ has received Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track designation from the FDA. The Orphan Drug Act is intended to assist and encourage companies to develop safe and effective therapies for the treatment of rare diseases and disorders. In addition to providing a seven-year term of market exclusivity for HyBryte™ upon final FDA approval, Orphan Drug designation also positions us to be able to leverage a wide range of financial and regulatory benefits, including government grants for conducting clinical trials, waiver of FDA user fees for the potential submission of a NDA for HyBryte™, and certain tax credits. In addition, Fast Track is a designation that the FDA reserves for a drug intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and one that demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs. For instance, we were eligible to submit an NDA for HyBryte™ on a rolling basis, permitting the FDA to review sections of the NDA prior to receiving the complete submission. Additionally, NDAs for Fast Track development programs ordinarily will be eligible for priority review. HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL also was granted Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) Committee for Orphan Medical Products and Promising Innovative Medicine (“PIM”) designation from the MHRA, as well as Innovation Passport under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (“ILAP”) in the UK.
During January 2021, we signed an exclusive Supply, Distribution and Services Agreement with The Daavlin Distributing Co. (“Daavlin”), securing long-term supply and distribution of a commercially ready light device, which is an integral component of the regulatory and commercial strategy for HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL. Pursuant to the agreement, Daavlin will exclusively manufacture the proprietary light device for use with HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL. Upon 

5



approval of HyBryte™ by the FDA, we will promote HyBryte™ and the companion light device, and facilitate the direct purchase of the device from Daavlin. Daavlin will exclusively distribute and sell the HyBryte™ light device to us, physicians and patients.
In April 2021, the FDA conditionally accepted HyBryte™ as the proposed brand name for SGX301 or synthetic hypericin, in the treatment of early stage CTCL. The name HyBryte™ was developed in compliance with the FDA’s Guidance for Industry, Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names. The FDA’s conditional approval validates HyBryte™ as a proprietary name that is consistent with the FDA’s goal of preventing medication errors and potential harm to the public by ensuring that only appropriate proprietary names are approved for use. Final approval of the HyBryte™ proprietary name is conditioned on FDA approval of the product candidate, SGX301.
In May 2021, HyBryte™ was awarded an "Innovation Passport" for the treatment of early stage CTCL in adults under the UK’s ILAP. The decision to award the Innovation Passport to the HyBryte™ program was made by the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway Steering Group, which is comprised of representatives from MHRA, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”), and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (“SMC”). ILAP was launched at the start of 2021 to accelerate the development and access to promising medicines, thereby facilitating patient access to new medicines. The pathway, part of the UK’s plan to attract life sciences development in the post-Brexit era, features enhanced input and interactions with the MHRA, NICE, and SMC. The innovation passport designation is the first step in the ILAP process and triggers the MHRA and its partner agencies to create a target development profile to chart out a roadmap for regulatory and development milestones with the goal of early patient access in the UK. Other benefits of ILAP include a 150-day accelerated assessment, rolling review and a continuous benefit risk assessment.
As a result of discussions with the FDA regarding the HyBryte™ NDA submission and due to disruptions caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic resulting in delays by the commercial active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) contract manufacturer affecting the timing of availability of the pre-requisite amount of accrued stability data required to file the NDA, we filed the NDA with the FDA in December of 2022. We did not pursue a rolling NDA submission, so that we could provide additional supportive data in the NDA filing. 
In June 2021, we received a Paediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) waiver from the EMA for HyBryte™. As part of the regulatory process for the registration of new medicines with the EMA, pharmaceutical companies are required to provide a PIP outlining their strategies for investigation of the new medicinal products in the pediatric population. In some instances, a waiver negating the need for a PIP for certain conditions may be granted by the EMA when development of a medicine for use in children is not feasible or appropriate, as is the case for HyBryte™ in CTCL which is extremely rare in children.
In September 2021, we were granted orphan drug designation for the active ingredient hypericin for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, extending the target population beyond CTCL as previously granted by the FDA.
In July 2022, the results of our successful Phase 3 FLASH study evaluating HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Dermatology.
In July 2022, we received agreement from the FDA on an initial pediatric study plan (iPSP) for HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL. The agreed iPSP stipulates that we intend to request a full waiver of pediatric studies upon submission of the NDA. Agreement with FDA on an iPSP is one of the regulatory requirements that must be met prior to submitting a NDA.
In September 2022, the FDA awarded an Orphan Products Development grant to support the evaluation of HyBryte™ for expanded treatment in patients with early-stage CTCL. The grant, totaling $2.6 million over 4 years, was awarded to a prestigious academic institution that was a leading enroller in the recently published positive Phase 3 FLASH study in the treatment of early stage CTCL.
In December 2022, we submitted the HyBryte™ NDA for the treatment of CTCL with the FDA.
In February 2023 we received a RTF letter from the FDA for the HyBryte™ NDA. Upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. We are preparing for a Type A meeting with the FDA to clarify and respond to the issues identified in the RTF letter and to seek additional guidance concerning information that the agency would require for a resubmitted NDA to be deemed acceptable.

We estimate the potential worldwide market for HyBryte™ is in excess of $250 million for the treatment of CTCL. This potential market information is a forward-looking statement, and investors are urged not to place undue reliance on this statement. While we have determined this potential market size based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable, there are a number of factors that could cause our expectations to change or not be realized.
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma
CTCL is a class of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (“NHL”), a type of cancer of the white blood cells that are an integral part of the immune system. Unlike most NHLs, which generally involve B-cell lymphocytes (involved in producing antibodies), CTCL is caused by an expansion of malignant T-cell lymphocytes (involved in cell-mediated immunity) normally programmed to migrate to the skin. These skin-trafficking malignant T-cells migrate to the skin, causing various lesions to appear that may change shape as the disease progresses, typically beginning as a rash and eventually forming plaques and tumors. Mycosis fungoides (“MF”) is the most common form of CTCL. It generally presents with skin involvement only, manifested as scaly, erythematous patches. Advanced disease with diffuse lymph node and visceral organ involvement is usually associated with a poorer response rate to standard therapies. A relatively uncommon sub-group of CTCL patients present with extensive skin involvement and circulating malignant cerebriform T-cells, referred to as Sézary syndrome. These patients have substantially graver prognoses (expected five-year survival rate of 24%), than those with MF (expected five-year survival rate of 88%).
CTCL mortality is related to stage of disease, with median survival generally ranging from about 12 years in the early stages to only 2.5 years when the disease has advanced. There is currently no FDA-approved drug for front-line treatment of early stage CTCL. Treatment of early-stage disease generally involves skin-directed therapies. One of the most common unapproved therapies used for early-stage disease is oral 5 or 8-methoxypsoralen (“Psoralen”) given with ultraviolet A (“UVA”) light, referred to as PUVA, which is approved for dermatological conditions such as disabling psoriasis not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, idiopathic vitiligo and skin manifestations of CTCL in persons who have not been responsive to other forms of treatment. Psoralen is a mutagenic chemical that interferes with DNA causing mutations and other malignancies. Moreover, UVA is a carcinogenic light source that when combined with the Psoralen, results in serious adverse effects including secondary skin cancers; therefore, the FDA requires a Black Box warning for PUVA.
CTCL constitutes a rare group of NHLs, occurring in about 4% of the approximate 500,000 individuals living with NHL. We estimate, based upon review of historic published studies and reports and an interpolation of data on the incidence of CTCL, that it affects over 20,000 individuals in the U.S., with approximately 2,800 new cases seen annually.
SGX302 – for Treating Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis
SGX302 (synthetic hypericin) is a potent photosensitizer that is topically applied to skin lesions and taken up by cutaneous T-cells. With subsequent activation by safe, visible light, T-cell apoptosis is induced, addressing the root cause of psoriasis lesions. Other PDTs have shown efficacy in psoriasis with a similar apoptotic mechanism, albeit using UV light associated with more severe potential long-term toxicities. The use of visible light in the red-yellow spectrum has the advantage of deeper penetration into the skin (much more than UV light) potentially treating deeper skin disease and thicker plaques and lesions, similar to what was observed in the positive Phase 3 FLASH study in CTCL. Further, this treatment approach avoids the risk of secondary malignancies (including melanoma) inherent with both the frequently used DNA-damaging drugs and other phototherapies that are dependent on UVA or UVB exposure. The use of SGX302 coupled with safe, visible light also avoids the risk of serious infections and cancer associated with the systemic immunosuppressive treatments used in psoriasis. 
In September 2021, following the validation of synthetic hypericin’s biologic activity in the positive pivotal Phase 3 FLASH study in CTCL, as well as positive proof-of-concept demonstrated in a small Phase 1/2 pilot study in mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients, we decided to expand this novel therapy into a Phase 2a clinical trial in mild-to-moderate psoriasis. We estimate the potential worldwide market for SGX302 to be in excess of $1 billion for the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. This potential market information is a forward-looking statement, and investors are urged not to place undue reliance on this statement. While we have determined this potential market size based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable, there are a number of factors that could cause our expectations to change or not be realized.
In June 2022, we received FDA IND clearance for our Phase 2a clinical trial (protocol number HPN-PSR-01) titled, "Phase 2 Study Evaluating SGX302 in the Treatment of Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis." In December 2022, we initiated patient 

7



enrollment for the Phase 2a study (protocol number HPN-PSR-01) evaluating SGX302 in the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. The Phase 2a clinical trial (protocol number HPN-PSR-01) will target enrollment of up to 42 patients ages 18 years or older with mild to moderate, stable psoriasis covering 2 to 30% of the body. In both Parts A and B, all patients will apply the study drug twice per week and activate the drug with visible light 24 ± 6 hours later using the supplied visible light devices and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Patients will undergo treatments for a total of 18 weeks and, on completion, will be followed for a four-week follow-up period in which patients will not receive other psoriasis treatments. In Part A, five to ten patients will be assigned open-label SGX302 (0.25% hypericin) at the time of enrollment. Once the tolerability and response to SGX302 has been established, Part B of the protocol will commence. In Part B, patients will be randomized to double-blind treatment groups at a ratio 1:1 of active drug to placebo ointment. Active dermatologic assessment of treated lesions for adverse events will be performed immediately before and during light treatments. Patients will be assessed for overall disease status through four weeks of follow-up. Efficacy endpoints will include the extent of lesion clearance and patient reported quality of life indices. Routine safety data also will be collected.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, non-communicable, itchy and often painful inflammatory skin condition for which there is no cure. Psoriasis has a significantly detrimental impact on patients' quality of life, and is associated with cardiovascular, arthritic, and metabolic diseases, as well as psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression and suicide. Many factors contribute to development of psoriasis including both genetic and environmental factors (e.g., skin trauma, infections, and medications). The lesions develop because of rapidly proliferating skin cells, driven by autoimmune T-cell mediated inflammation. Of the various types of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis is the most common and is characterized by dry, red raised plaques that are covered by silvery-white scales occurring most commonly on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Approximately 80% of patients have mild-to-moderate disease. Mild psoriasis is generally characterized by the involvement of less than 3% of the body surface area (“BSA”), while moderate psoriasis will typically involve 3-10% BSA and severe psoriasis greater than 10% BSA. Between 20% and 30% of individuals with psoriasis will go on to develop chronic, inflammatory arthritis (psoriatic arthritis) that can lead to joint deformations and disability. Studies have also associated psoriasis, and particularly severe psoriasis, with an increased relative risk of lymphoma, particularly CTCL. Although psoriasis can occur at any age, most patients present with the condition before age 35.
Treatment of psoriasis is based on its severity at the time of presentation with the goal of controlling symptoms. It varies from topical options including PDT to reduce pain and itching, and potentially reduce the inflammation driving plaque formation, to systemic treatments for more severe disease. Most common systemic treatments and even current topical photo/photodynamic therapy such as UV A and B, carry a risk of increased skin cancer.
Psoriasis is the most common immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. According to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) Global Report on Psoriasis 2016, the prevalence of psoriasis is between 1.5% and 5% in most developed countries, with some suggestions of incidence increasing with time. It is estimated, based upon review of historic published studies and reports and an interpolation of data that psoriasis affects 3% of the U.S. population or more than 7.5 million people. Current estimates have as many as 60-125 million people worldwide living with the condition. The global psoriasis treatment market was valued at approximately $15 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach as much as $40 billion by 2027.
Dusquetide
Dusquetide (research name: SGX94) is an IDR that regulates the innate immune system to simultaneously reduce inflammation, eliminate infection and enhance tissue healing. Dusquetide is based on a new class of short, synthetic peptides known as IDRs. It has a novel mechanism of action in that it modulates the body’s reaction to both injury and infection and is both simultaneously anti-inflammatory and anti-infective. IDRs have no direct antibiotic activity but modulate host responses, increasing survival after infections with a broad range of bacterial Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens including both antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains, as well as accelerating resolution of tissue damage following exposure to a variety of agents including bacterial pathogens, trauma and chemo- or radiation-therapy. IDRs represent a novel approach to the control of infection and tissue damage via highly selective binding to an intracellular adaptor protein, sequestosome-1, also known as p62, which has a pivotal function in signal transduction during activation and control of the innate defense system. Preclinical data indicate that IDRs may be active in models of a wide range of therapeutic indications including life-threatening bacterial infections as well as the severe side-effects of chemo- and radiation-therapy. Additionally, due to selective binding to p62, dusquetide may have potential anti-tumor action.

Dusquetide has demonstrated efficacy in numerous animal disease models including mucositis, oncology, colitis, skin infection and other bacterial infections and has been evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial in 84 healthy volunteers with both single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose components. Dusquetide was shown to have a good safety profile and be well-tolerated in all dose groups when administered by IV over 7 days and was consistent with safety results seen in pre-clinical studies. We believe that market opportunities for dusquetide include, but are not limited to, oral and gastrointestinal mucositis, oncology (e.g., breast cancer), acute Gram-positive bacterial infections (e.g., methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”)), acute Gram-negative infections (e.g., acinetobacter, melioidosis), and acute radiation syndrome.

SGX942 is our product candidate containing our IDR technology, dusquetide, targeting the treatment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. Oral mucositis in this patient population is an area of unmet medical need where there are currently no approved drug therapies. Accordingly, we received Fast Track designation for the treatment of oral mucositis as a result of radiation and/or chemotherapy treatment in head and neck cancer patients from the FDA. In addition, dusquetide has been granted PIM designation in the UK by the MHRA for the treatment of SOM in head and neck cancer patients receiving chemoradiation therapy. 
We initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of SGX942 for the treatment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients in December of 2013. We completed enrollment in this trial and released positive results in December 2015. In this Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study that enrolled 111 patients, SGX942, at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, successfully reduced the median duration of SOM by 50%, from 18 days to 9 days (p=0.099) in all patients and by 67%, from 30 days to 10 days (p=0.040) in patients receiving the most aggressive chemoradiation therapy for treatment of their head and neck cancer. The p-values met the prospectively defined statistical threshold of p<0.1 in the study protocol. A less severe occurrence of oral mucositis, ulcerative oral mucositis (defined as oral mucositis with a WHO score ≥2 corresponding to the occurrence of overt ulceration in the mouth), was also monitored during the study. In the patients receiving the most aggressive chemoradiation therapy, the median duration of oral mucositis was found to decrease from 65 days in the placebo treated patients to 51 days in the patients treated with SGX942 1.5 mg/kg (p=0.099).
In addition to identifying the best dose of 1.5 mg/kg, this study achieved all objectives, including increased incidence of “complete response” of tumor at the one month follow-up visit (47% in placebo vs. 63% in SGX942 at 1.5 mg/kg). Decreases in mortality and decreases in infection rate were also observed with SGX942 treatment, consistent with the preclinical results observed in animal models. Data from this Phase 2 trial are published in the Journal of Biotechnology. 
SGX942 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, consistent with the safety profile observed in the prior Phase 1 study conducted in 84 healthy volunteers. The long-term (12 month) follow-up data was consistent with the preliminary positive safety and efficacy findings. While the placebo population experienced the expected 12-month survival rate of approximately 80%, as defined in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results statistics 1975-2012 from the National Cancer Institute, the SGX942 1.5 mg/kg treatment group reported a 12-month survival rate of 93% (7% mortality in the SGX942 1.5 mg/kg group compared to 19% in the placebo group). Similarly, tumor resolution (complete response) at 12 months was better in the SGX942 1.5 mg/kg treatment group relative to the placebo population (80% in the 1.5 mg/kg group compared to 74% in the placebo group). The long-term follow-up results from the Phase 2 study are published in Biotechnology Reports.
In September 2016, we and SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“SciClone”) entered into an exclusive license agreement, pursuant to which we granted rights to SciClone to develop, promote, market, distribute and sell SGX942 in defined territories. Under the terms of the license agreement, SciClone will be responsible for all aspects of development, product registration and commercialization in the territories, having access to data generated by us. In exchange for exclusive rights, SciClone will pay us royalties on net sales, and we will supply commercial drug product to SciClone on a cost-plus basis, while maintaining worldwide manufacturing rights.
Based on the positive and previously published Phase 2 results (Study IDR-OM-01), in July 2017, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial referred to as the “DOM–INNATE” (Dusquetide treatment in Oral Mucositis – by modulating INNATE immunity) study. Approximately 50 U.S. and European oncology centers participated in this trial. The Phase 3 protocol (Study IDR-OM-02) was a highly powered, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational trial that sought to enroll approximately 260 subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx who were scheduled to receive a minimum total cumulative radiation dose of 55 Gy fractionated as 2.0-2.2 Gy per day with concomitant cisplatin 

9



chemotherapy given as a dose of 80-100 mg/m2 every third week. Subjects were randomized to receive either 1.5 mg/kg SGX942 or placebo given twice a week during and for two weeks following completion of chemoradiation therapy (“CRT”). The primary endpoint for the study was the median duration of SOM, which was assessed by oral examination at each treatment visit and then through six weeks following completion of CRT. Oral mucositis is evaluated using the WHO Grading system. SOM is defined as a WHO Grade of ≥3. Subjects are followed for an additional 12 months after the completion of treatment.
In April 2019, the Paediatric Committee of the EMA approved our PIP for SGX942, a prerequisite for filing a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for any new medicinal product in Europe. The EMA also agreed that we may defer conducting the PIP until successful completion of our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SGX942, which allows us to file the adult indication MAA prior to completion of the PIP.
In June 2020, the pivotal Phase 3 DOM–INNATE study (Study IDR-OM-02) completed enrollment of 268 subjects. In December 2020, the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial for SGX942 showed that the primary endpoint of median duration of SOM did not achieve the pre-specified criterion for statistical significance (p≤0.05); although biological activity was observed with a 56% reduction in the median duration of SOM from 18 days in the placebo group to 8 days in the SGX942 treatment group. Despite this clinically meaningful improvement, the variability in the distribution of the data yielded a p-value that was not statistically significant. Other secondary endpoints supported the biological activity of dusquetide, including a statistically significant 50% reduction in the median duration of SOM in the per-protocol population, which decreased from 18 days in the placebo group to 9 days in the SGX942 treatment group (p=0.049), consistent with the findings in the Phase 2 trial (Study IDR-OM-01). Similarly, incidence of SOM also followed this biological trend as seen in the Phase 2 study, decreasing by 16% in the SGX942 treatment group relative to the placebo group in the per-protocol population. The per-protocol population was defined as the population receiving a minimum of 55 Gy radiation and at least 10 doses of study drug (placebo or SGX942) throughout the intended treatment period, with no major protocol deviations (e.g. breaks in study drug administration longer than 8 days between successive doses). 
Following analysis of the full dataset, including the 12-month long-term follow-up safety data in late 2021, we held a meeting with the MHRA to review the study results and to obtain further clarity on the future of the oral mucositis development program. The meeting was informative with the outcome being that based on the SGX942 biologic activity observed and the consistency in response between the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, the Phase 3 DOM-INNATE study could serve as the first of two Phase 3 studies required to support potential marketing authorization, assuming the second Phase 3 clinical trial achieves the required level of statistical significance in its primary endpoint. With the benefit of a robust preclinical and clinical data package for SGX942, we now will analyze the data to design a second Phase 3 study and will look to identify a potential partner(s) to continue this development program.
​
In January 2022, dusquetide proved effective at reducing tumor size in nonclinical xenograft models. Recent studies, recapitulating results from previously published studies, have confirmed the efficacy of dusquetide as a stand-alone and combination anti-tumor therapy, with radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapy, in the context of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Of note, these results are consistent with a potential direct anti-tumor effect identified with SGX942 and is another important consideration in the oral mucositis treatment space.
​
In June 2022, an article was published describing the binding of our Innate Defense Regulator (“IDR”), dusquetide, to the p62 protein. Dusquetide binds to p62 or SQSTM-1, a scaffold protein implicated in a number of intracellular signaling networks implicated in tumor cell survival, including autophagy. This recent publication elaborates on the direct interaction of dusquetide with p62, as well as some of the direct downstream consequences of that interaction, consistent with its observed anti-infective, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities. This information advances the understanding of dusquetide's novel mechanism of action and supports the development of analogs related to dusquetide.
​
Oral Mucositis
Mucositis is the clinical term for damage done to the mucosa by anticancer therapies. It can occur in any mucosal region, but is most commonly associated with the mouth, followed by the small intestine. We estimate, based upon our review of historic studies and reports, and an interpolation of data on the incidence of mucositis, that mucositis affects approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. per year and occurs in 40% of patients receiving chemotherapy. Mucositis can be severely debilitating and can lead to infection, sepsis, the need for parenteral nutrition and narcotic analgesia. The GI damage causes severe diarrhea. These symptoms can limit the doses and duration of cancer treatment, leading to sub-optimal treatment outcomes.

10



The mechanisms of mucositis have been extensively studied and have been linked to the interaction of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with the innate defense system. Bacterial infection of the ulcerative lesions is regarded as a secondary consequence of dysregulated local inflammation triggered by therapy-induced cell death, rather than as the primary cause of the lesions.
We estimate, based upon our review of historic studies and reports, and an interpolation of data on the incidence of oral mucositis, that oral mucositis is a subpopulation of approximately 90,000 patients in the U.S., with a comparable number in Europe. Oral mucositis almost always occurs in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy (greater than 80% incidence of severe mucositis) and is common in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation, where the incidence and severity of oral mucositis depends greatly on the nature of the conditioning regimen used for myeloablation.
Oral BDP
BDP (beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate) has been marketed in the U.S. and worldwide since the early 1970s as the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a nasal spray and in a metered-dose inhaler for the treatment of patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. BDP is specifically formulated for oral administration as a single product consisting of two tablets. One tablet is intended to release BDP in the upper sections of the GI tract and the other tablet is intended to release BDP in the lower sections of the GI tract. Based on its pharmacological characteristics, BDP may have utility in treating other conditions of the GI tract having an inflammatory component, such as pediatric Crohn’s disease. 
SGX203 – for Treating Pediatric Crohn’s Disease
SGX203 (BDP) represents a first-of-its-kind oral, locally acting therapy tailored to treat GI inflammation. Based on its pharmacological characteristics, BDP may have utility in treating multiple conditions of the GI tract having an inflammatory component. BDP has been marketed in the U.S. and worldwide since the early 1970s as the API in a nasal spray and in a metered-dose inhaler for the treatment of patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. SGX203 for the treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease is specifically formulated as a two tablet delivery system for oral use that allows for administration of immediate and delayed release BDP throughout the small bowel and the colon. The FDA has given SGX203 Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track designation for the treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease. We will pursue a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SGX203 for the treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease contingent upon additional funding, such as through partnership funding support.
We estimate the potential worldwide market for BDP is in excess of $500 million for all applications, including the treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease. This potential market information is a forward-looking statement, and investors are urged not to place undue reliance on this statement. While we have determined this potential market size based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable, there are a number of factors that could cause our expectations to change or not be realized.
Pediatric Crohn’s Disease
Crohn’s disease causes inflammation of the GI tract. Crohn’s disease can affect any area of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus, but it most commonly affects the lower part of the small intestine, called the ileum. The swelling caused by the disease extends deep into the lining of the affected organ. The swelling can induce pain and can make the intestines empty frequently, resulting in diarrhea. Because the symptoms of Crohn’s disease are similar to other intestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis, it can be difficult to diagnose. People of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage have an increased risk of developing Crohn’s disease.
Crohn’s disease can appear at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in adults in their 20s and 30s. However, approximately 30% of people with Crohn’s disease develop symptoms before 20 years of age. We estimate, based upon our review of historic published studies and reports, and an interpolation of data on the incidence of pediatric Crohn’s disease, that pediatric Crohn’s disease is a subpopulation of approximately 80,000 patients in the U.S. with a comparable number in Europe. Crohn’s disease tends to be both severe and extensive in the pediatric population and a relatively high proportion (approximately 40%) of pediatric Crohn’s patients have involvement of their upper GI tract.
Crohn’s disease presents special challenges for children and teens. In addition to bothersome and often painful symptoms, the disease can stunt growth, delay puberty, and weaken bones. Crohn’s disease symptoms may sometimes prevent a 

11



child from participating in enjoyable activities. The emotional and psychological issues of living with a chronic disease can be especially difficult for young people.
Public Health Solutions Overview
ThermoVax® – Thermostability Platform Technology
ThermoVax® is a novel method for thermostabilizing vaccines with a variety of adjuvants, resulting in a single vial which can be reconstituted with water for injection immediately prior to use. One of the adjuvants utilized in ThermoVax® is aluminum salts (known colloquially as “Alum”). Alum is the most widely employed adjuvant technology in the vaccine industry.
The value of ThermoVax® lies in its potential ability to eliminate the need for cold chain production, transportation, and storage for Alum-adjuvanted vaccines. This would relieve the high costs of producing and maintaining vaccines under refrigerated conditions. Based on historical reports from WHO and other scientific reports, we believe that a meaningful proportion of vaccine doses globally are wasted due to excursions from required cold chain temperature ranges. This is due to the fact that many vaccines need to be maintained either between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (“C”), frozen below -20 degrees C, or frozen below -60 degrees C, and even brief excursions from these temperature ranges usually necessitate the destruction of the product or the initiation of costly stability programs specific for the vaccine lots in question. ThermoVax® has the potential to facilitate easier storage and distribution of strategic national stockpile vaccines for ricin exposure in emergency settings.
ThermoVax® development, specifically in the context of an Alum adjuvant, was supported pursuant to our $9.4 million NIAID grant enabling development of thermo-stable ricin (RiVax®) and anthrax vaccines. Proof-of-concept preclinical studies with ThermoVax® indicate that it is able to produce stable vaccine formulations using adjuvants, protein immunogens, and other components that ordinarily would not withstand long temperature variations exceeding customary refrigerated storage conditions. These studies were conducted with our Alum-adjuvanted ricin toxin vaccine, RiVax® and our Alum-adjuvanted anthrax vaccine. Each vaccine was manufactured under precise lyophilization conditions using excipients that aid in maintaining native protein structure of the key antigen. When RiVax® was kept at 40 degrees C (104 degrees Fahrenheit (“F”)) for up to one year, all of the animals vaccinated with the lyophilized RiVax® vaccine developed potent and high titer neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, animals that were vaccinated with the liquid RiVax® vaccine kept at 40 degrees C did not develop neutralizing antibodies and were not protected against ricin exposure. The ricin A chain is extremely sensitive to temperature and rapidly loses the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies when exposed to temperatures higher than 8 degrees C. When the anthrax vaccine was kept for up to 16 weeks at 70 degrees C, it was able to develop a potent antibody response, unlike the liquid formulation kept at the same temperature. Moreover, we also have demonstrated the compatibility of our thermostabilization technology with other secondary adjuvants such as TLR-4 agonists.
We also entered into a collaboration agreement with Axel Lehrer, PhD of the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, John A. Burns School of Medicine (“JABSOM”), University of Hawai’i at Manoa (“UH Manoa”) and Hawaii Biotech, Inc. (“HBI”) to develop a heat stable subunit Ebola vaccine. Dr. Lehrer, a co-inventor of the Ebola vaccine with HBI, has shown proof of concept efficacy with subunit Ebola vaccines in non-human primates (“NHP”). The most advanced Ebola vaccines involve the use of vesicular stomatitis virus and adenovirus vectors – live, viral vectors which complicate the manufacturing, stability and storage requirements. Dr. Lehrer’s vaccine candidate is based on highly purified recombinant protein antigens, circumventing many of these manufacturing difficulties. Dr. Lehrer and HBI have developed a robust manufacturing process for the required proteins. Application of ThermoVax® may allow for a product that can avoid the need for cold chain distribution and storage, yielding a vaccine ideal for use in both the developed and developing world. This agreement has expired in accordance with its terms.
In December 2010, we executed a worldwide exclusive license agreement with the University of Colorado (“UC”) for certain patents relating to ThermoVax® in all fields of use. In April 2018, the UC delivered a notice of termination of our license agreement based upon our failure to achieve one of the development milestones: initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial of the heat stabilization technology by March 31, 2018. After negotiating with the UC, we and the UC agreed to extend the termination date to October 31, 2018 in order to allow us time to agree upon a potential agreement that would allow us to keep the rights to, and to continue to develop, the heat stabilization technology or a product candidate containing the heat stabilization technology in our field of use.
During September 2017, we were awarded funding of approximately $700,000 over five years under a NIAID Research Project (R01) grant awarded to UH Manoa for the development of a trivalent thermostabilized filovirus vaccine (including 

12



protection against Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg Marburgvirus). Previous collaborations demonstrated the feasibility of developing a heat stable subunit Ebola vaccine. Under the terms of the subaward, we will continue to support vaccine formulation development with our proprietary vaccine thermostabilization technology, ThermoVax®. Ultimately, the objective is to produce a thermostable trivalent filovirus vaccine for protection against Ebola and related diseases, allowing worldwide distribution without the need for cold storage. Based on current U.S. government needs, efforts have recently been expanded to focus on a monovalent or bivalent vaccine to specifically address Marburg marburgvirus.
In October 2018, in a series of related transactions, (a) we and the UC agreed to terminate the original license agreement, (b) the UC and VitriVax, Inc. (“VitriVax”) executed a worldwide exclusive license agreement for the heat stabilization technology for all fields of use, and (c) we and VitriVax executed a worldwide exclusive sublicense agreement, which was amended and restated in October 2020, for the heat stabilization technology for use in the fields of ricin and Ebola vaccines. We paid a $100,000 sublicense fee on the effective date of the sublicense agreement. Under the amended sublicense agreement to maintain the sublicense we are obliged to pay a minimum annual royalty of $20,000 until first commercial sale of a sublicensed product, upon which point, we shall pay an earned royalty of 2% of net sales subject to a minimum royalty of $50,000 each year. We are also required to pay royalty on any sub-sublicense income based on a declining percentage of all sub-sublicense income calculated within the contractual period until reaching a minimum of 15% after two years. In addition, we are required to pay VitriVax milestone fees of: (a) $25,000 upon initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of the sublicensed product, (b) $100,000 upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the sublicensed product, (c) $100,000 upon regulatory approval of a sublicensed product, and (d) $1 million upon achieving $10 million in aggregate net sales of a sublicensed product in the U.S. or equivalent. To date none of these milestones have been met.
In March 2020, we entered into a research collaboration with Axel Lehrer, PhD of the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, JABSOM, UH Manoa to further expand the filovirus collaboration to investigation of potential coronavirus vaccines, including for SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19). This research collaboration will utilize the technology platform developed in the search for filovirus vaccines and will use well-defined surface glycoprotein(s) from one or more coronaviruses, which are expected to be protective for COVID-19.
During April 2020, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license for CoVaccine HT™, a novel vaccine adjuvant, from SERB Pharmaceuticals (formerly BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, a division of Boston Scientific Corporation) (“SERB”), for the fields of coronavirus infection (including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19), and pandemic flu. CoVaccine HT™ is a novel adjuvant, which has been shown to enhance both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity. We and our collaborators, including UH Manoa and Dr. Axel Lehrer, have successfully demonstrated the utility of CoVaccine HT™ in the development of our heat stable filovirus vaccine program, with vaccine candidates against Ebola and Marburg virus disease. Given this previous success, CoVaccine HT™ will potentially be an important component of our vaccine technology platform currently being assessed for use against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. The license agreement was executed between us and SERB, which owns the CoVaccine HT™ intellectual property.
In September 2020, the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences published a scientific article detailing the thermostabilization of the filovirus GP proteins and key assays describing their stability. 
During October 2020, Frontiers in Immunology published a scientific article describing CiVax™, a prototype COVID-19 vaccine, using the novel CoVaccine HT™ adjuvant and demonstrating significant immunogenicity, including strong total and neutralizing antibody responses, with a balanced Th1 response, as well as enhancement of cell mediated immunity. These are all considered to be critical attributes of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. 
In December 2020, NIAID awarded us a Direct to Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grant of approximately $1.5 million to support manufacture, formulation (including thermostabilization) and characterization of COVID-19 and Ebola Virus Disease (“EVD”) vaccine candidates in conjunction with the CoVaccine HT™ adjuvant. This award also is supporting immune characterization of this novel, emulsified adjuvant that has unique potency and compatibility with lyophilization strategies to enable thermostabilization of subunit vaccines.
During August 2021, positive data demonstrated the efficacy of multiple filovirus vaccine candidates in NHP, including thermostabilized multivalent vaccines in a single vial platform presentation. Collaborators at UH Manoa describe the potent efficacy of vaccine candidates protecting against three life-threatening filoviruses, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg Marburgvirus in an article titled "Recombinant Protein Filovirus Vaccines Protect Cynomolgus Macaques from Ebola, Sudan, and Marburg Viruses", published in Frontiers in Immunology. These vaccine candidates contain highly purified protein antigens combined with the novel CoVaccine HT™ adjuvant, in both monovalent (single antigen) and 

13



bivalent (two antigen) formulations. Most recently, efforts to formulate all three antigens and adjuvant into a thermostable single-vial vaccine platform has also been shown to protect 75% of vaccinated NHPs against subsequent Sudan ebolavirus challenge, with further development to test efficacy against other filovirus infections ongoing.
During August 2021, Vaccine published a scientific article describing the formulation of single-vial platform presentations of monovalent (single antigen), bivalent (two antigens) and trivalent (three antigens) combinations of filovirus vaccine candidates. 
During September 2021, an accelerated preprint was posted on bioRxiv of pre-clinical immunogenicity studies for CiVax™ (heat stable COVID-19 vaccine program) demonstrating durable broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody responses, including against the Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concern. The scientific article is part of the ongoing collaboration with Axel Lehrer, PhD, Associate Professor at the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology, JABSOM, UH Manoa. Development continues under a non-dilutive $1.5M grant from the NIAID awarded to us in December 2020.
In December 2021, 100% protection of NHPs against lethal Sudan ebolavirus challenge was achieved using a bivalent, thermostabilized vaccine formulated in a single vial, reconstituted only with water immediately prior to use. This milestone is part of an ongoing collaboration with UH Manoa and further demonstrates the broad applicability of the vaccine platform, and its potential role in the U.S. government's initiative for pandemic preparedness.
In May 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a Notice of Allowance for the patent application titled “Composition and Methods of Manufacturing Trivalent Filovirus Vaccines.” The allowed claims are directed to unique, proprietary composition and methods directed to combinations of glycoprotein antigens with nano-emulsion adjuvants comprising sucrose fatty acid esters prior to lyophilization. The described vaccine platform has previously been successfully applied to filovirus vaccines (as mono-, bi- and tri-valent candidates for Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Marburg marburgvirus) as well as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
In June 2022, 100% protection of NHPs against lethal Marburg marburgvirus challenge was achieved using a bivalent, thermostabilized vaccine formulated in a single vial, reconstituted only with sterile water immediately prior to use. This important milestone is part of an ongoing collaboration with UH Manoa, demonstrating the successful presentation of one or more antigen(s) within the same formulation while maintaining full potency and thermostability. It further demonstrates the broad applicability of the heat stable vaccine platform, and its potential role in the U.S. government's initiative for pandemic preparedness.
RiVax® – Ricin Toxin Vaccine
RiVax® is our proprietary vaccine candidate being developed to protect against exposure to ricin toxin and if approved, would be the first ricin vaccine. The immunogen in RiVax® induces a protective immune response in animal models of ricin exposure and functionally active antibodies in humans. The immunogen consists of a genetically inactivated ricin A chain subunit that is enzymatically inactive and lacks residual toxicity of the holotoxin. RiVax® has demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.0001) preclinical survival results, providing 100% protection against acute lethality in an aerosol exposure non-human primate model (Roy et al, 2015, Thermostable ricin vaccine protects rhesus macaques against aerosolized ricin: Epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection, PNAS USA 112:3782-3787), and has also been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in two Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers. Results of the first Phase 1 human trial of RiVax® established that the immunogen was safe and induced antibodies that we believe may protect humans from ricin exposure. The antibodies generated from vaccination, concentrated and purified, were capable of conferring immunity passively to recipient animals, indicating that the vaccine was capable of inducing functionally active antibodies in humans. The outcome of this study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Vitetta et al., 2006, A Pilot Clinical Trial of a Recombinant Ricin Vaccine in Normal Humans, PNAS, 103:2268-2273). The second trial that was completed in September 2012 and was sponsored by University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (“UTSW”) evaluated a more potent formulation of RiVax® that contained an Alum adjuvant. The results of the Phase 1b study indicated that Alum-adjuvanted RiVax® was safe and well tolerated, and induced greater ricin neutralizing antibody levels in humans than adjuvant-free RiVax®. The outcomes of this second study were published in the Clinical and Vaccine Immunology.
We have adapted the original manufacturing process for the immunogen contained in RiVax® for thermostability and large scale manufacturing and recent studies have confirmed that the thermostabilized RiVax® formulation enhances the stability of the RiVax® antigen, enabling storage for at least 1 year at temperatures up to 40 degrees C (104 degrees F). The program 

14



will pursue approval via the FDA “Animal Rule” since it is not possible to test the efficacy of the vaccine in a clinical study which would expose humans to ricin. Uniform, easily measured and species-neutral immune correlates of protection that can be measured in humans and animals, and are indicative of animal survival to subsequent ricin challenge, are central to the application of the “Animal Rule.” Recent work has identified such potential correlates of immune protection in animals and work to qualify and validate these approaches is continuing, with the goal of utilizing these assays in a planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial with the thermostable RiVax® formulation. During September 2018, we published an extended stability study of RiVax®, showing up to 100% protection in mice after 12 months storage at 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) as well as identification of a potential in vitro stability indicating assay, critical to adequately confirming the long-term shelf life of the vaccine. We have entered into a collaboration with IDT Biologika GmbH (“IDT”) to scale-up the formulation/filling process and continue development and validation of analytical methods established at IDT to advance the program. We also initiated a development agreement with Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. (“EBS”) to implement a commercially viable, scalable production technology for the RiVax® drug substance protein antigen.
The development of RiVax® has been sponsored through a series of overlapping challenge grants, UC1, and cooperative grants, U01, from the NIH, granted to us and to UTSW where the vaccine originated. The second clinical trial was supported by a grant from the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products to UTSW. To date, we and UTSW have collectively received approximately $25 million in grant funding from the NIH for the development of RiVax®. In September 2014, we entered into a contract with the NIH for the development of RiVax® pursuant to which we were awarded an additional $21.2 million of funding in the aggregate. The development agreements with EBS and IDT were specifically funded under this NIH contract.
In 2017, NIAID exercised options to fund additional animal efficacy studies and good manufacturing practices compliant RiVax® bulk drug substance and finished drug product manufacturing, which is required for the conduct of future preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies. The exercised options provide us with approximately $4.5 million in additional non-dilutive funding, bringing the total amount awarded to date under this contract to $21.2 million, which expired in February 2021. The total award of up to $21.2 million supported the preclinical, manufacturing and clinical development activities necessary to advance heat stable RiVax® with the FDA. In addition to this funding for the development of RiVax®, biomarkers for RiVax® testing have been successfully identified, facilitating potential approval under the FDA Animal Rule.
During December 2019, we initiated a third Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in eight healthy adult volunteer subjects designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of RiVax® utilizing ThermoVax®. During January 2020, we suspended the study after Emergent Manufacturing Operations Baltimore LLC (“EMOB”), the manufacturer of the drug substance, notified us that, after releasing the final drug product to us, EMOB identified that the active drug substance tested outside the established specification parameters. Two subjects had received doses as part of the study before the manufacturer provided this notice. Those two subjects were monitored with no safety issues noted and data was captured in accordance with the study protocol. They did not receive further doses of study drug.
During April 2020, we received notification from NIAID that they would not be exercising the final contract option to support the conduct of a Phase 1/2 clinical study in healthy volunteers. As a result, the total contract award will not exceed $21.2 million. This contract expired in February 2021.
In connection with failures relating to the manufacture of RiVax® bulk drug substance, on July 1, 2020, we filed a demand for arbitration against EBS, Emergent Product Development Gaithersburg, Inc. (“EPDG”); and EMOB (together with EBS and EPDG, “Emergent”) with the American Arbitration Association in Mercer County, New Jersey. We have alleged that (a) EPDG breached contracts, (b) EMOB breached contracts; and (c) Emergent fraudulently induced us into entering into the contracts with EPDG and EMOB. We sought to recover damages in excess of $19 million from Emergent. Emergent answered the demand for arbitration denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. We presented our case at an arbitration hearing over 12 days in January 2022. Following submission of post-hearing briefs, the arbitration panel heard closing oral arguments in April 2022. On July 6, 2022, the American Arbitration Association entered a final decision in connection with this arbitration. Despite the arbitration panel ruling that Emergent had committed a number of breaches of the parties’ contracts, the panel did not award monetary damages. On September 30, 2022, we filed a petition to vacate the arbitration decision with the Delaware Court of Chancery, requesting that the Court vacate the arbitration decision and remand the matter to the arbitration panel for rehearing. We cannot offer any assurances as to any result of our challenge of the arbitration decision or that we will recover any damages from Emergent. For more details regarding the arbitration against Emergent, see Part I – Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report.
In November 2021, an article was published on pre-clinical immunogenicity studies for RiVax® demonstrating enduring protection for at least 12 months post-vaccination. These results, coupled with the previous demonstration of efficacy in 

15



mice and NHPs as well as long-term thermostability (at least 1 year at 40 degrees C or 104 degrees F), reinforce the practicality of stockpiling and potentially utilizing the RiVax® vaccine in warfighters and civilian first responders without the complexities that arise for vaccines that require stringent cold chain handling.
RiVax® has been granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track designation by the FDA for the prevention of ricin intoxication. In addition, RiVax® has also been granted Orphan Drug designation in the European Union (“EU”) from the EMA Committee for Orphan Medical Products.
Assuming development efforts are successful for RiVax®, we believe potential government procurement contract(s) could reach as much as $200 million. This potential procurement contract information is a forward-looking statement, and investors are urged not to place undue reliance on this statement. While we have determined this potential procurement contract value based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable, there are a number of factors that could cause our expectations to change or not be realized.
As a new chemical entity, an FDA approved RiVax® vaccine has the potential to qualify for a biodefense Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”). Approved under the 21st Century Cures Act in late 2016, the biodefense PRV is awarded upon approval as a medical countermeasure when the active ingredient(s) have not been otherwise approved for use in any context. PRVs are transferable and can be sold, with sales in recent years of approximately $100 million. When redeemed, PRVs entitle the user to an accelerated review period of nine months, saving a median of seven months review time as calculated in 2009. However, FDA must be advised 90 days in advance of the use of the PRV and the use of a PRV is associated with an additional user fee ($1.3 million for fiscal year 2022).
In July 2022, we signed a worldwide exclusive agreement to license and supply our ricin antigen, used in our RiVax® vaccine, to SERB, for development of a novel therapeutic treatment against ricin toxin poisoning. In pursuit of a ricin antidote, SERB will leverage its unique broad-spectrum polyclonal antibody platform, gained in its acquisition of BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals. This specialized manufacturing process generates binding fragments from antibodies that are specific to a given antigen, helping to ensure potency and purity. This platform is currently used to manufacture two of SERB’s currently marketed products, CroFab® and DigiFab®.
Ricin Toxin
Ricin toxin can be cheaply and easily produced, is stable over long periods of time, is toxic by several routes of exposure and thus has the potential to be used as a biological weapon against military and/or civilian targets. As a bioterrorism agent, ricin could be disseminated as an aerosol, by injection, or as a food supply contaminant. The potential use of ricin toxin as a biological weapon of mass destruction has been highlighted in a Federal Bureau of Investigation Bioterror report released in November 2007 titled Terrorism 2002-2005, which states that “Ricin and the bacterial agent anthrax are emerging as the most prevalent agents involved in WMD investigations.” Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had threatened the use of ricin toxin to poison food and water supplies and in connection with explosive devices. Domestically, the threat from ricin remains a concern for security agencies. In April 2013, letters addressed to the U.S. President, a Senator and a judge tested positive for ricin. As recently as September 2020, ricin-laced letters addressed to the White House and others addressed to Texas law enforcement agencies were intercepted before delivery raising fresh concerns about the deadly toxin.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified ricin toxin as a Category B biological agent. Ricin works by first binding to glycoproteins found on the exterior of a cell, and then entering the cell and inhibiting protein synthesis leading to cell death. Once exposed to ricin toxin, there is no effective therapy available to reverse the course of the toxin. The recent ricin threat to government officials has heightened the awareness of this toxic threat. Currently, there is no FDA approved vaccine to protect against the possibility of ricin toxin being used in a terrorist attack, or its use as a weapon on the battlefield nor is there a known antidote for ricin toxin exposure.
SGX943 – for Treating Emerging and/or Antibiotic-Resistant Infectious Diseases
SGX943 is an IDR, containing the same active ingredient as SGX942. Dusquetide is a fully synthetic, 5-amino acid peptide with high aqueous solubility and stability. Extensive in vivo preclinical studies have demonstrated enhanced clearance of bacterial infection with SGX943 administration. SGX943 has shown efficacy against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections in preclinical models, independent of whether the bacteria is antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-sensitive.

16



The innate immune system is responsible for rapid and non-specific responses to combat bacterial infection. Augmenting these responses represents an alternative approach to treating bacterial infections. In animal models, IDRs are efficacious against both antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant infections, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and are active irrespective of whether the bacteria occupy a primarily extracellular or intracellular niche. IDRs are also effective as stand-alone agents or in conjunction with antibiotics. An IDR for the treatment of serious bacterial infections encompasses a number of clinical advantages including:

● | Treatment when antibiotics are contraindicated, such as:
--+---------------------------------------------------------


o | before the infectious organism and/or its antibiotic susceptibility is known; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | in at-risk populations prior to infection.
--+-------------------------------------------


● | An ability to be used as an additive, complementary treatment with antibiotics, thereby:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | enhancing efficacy of sub-optimal antibiotic regimens (e.g., partially antibiotic-resistant infections);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | enhancing clearance of infection, thereby minimizing the generation of antibiotic resistance (e.g., in treating melioidosis); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | reducing the required antibiotic dose, again potentially minimizing the generation of antibiotic resistance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An ability to modulate the deleterious consequences of inflammation in response to the infection, including the inflammation caused by antibiotic-driven bacterial lysis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Being unlikely to generate bacterial resistance since the IDR acts on the host, and not the pathogen.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importantly, systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure is the ultimate common outcome of not only emerging and/or antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases, but also of most biothreat agents (e.g., Burkholderia pseudomallei), indicating that dusquetide would be applicable not only to antibiotic-resistant infection, but also to biothreat agents, especially where the pathogen is not known and/or has been engineered for enhanced antibiotic resistance.
In May 2019, we were awarded a DTRA subcontract of approximately $600,000 over three years to participate in a biodefense contract for the development of medical countermeasures against bacterial threat agents. As of December 31, 2022, there was negligible revenue earned or expense incurred related to the DTRA subcontract.
The Drug Approval Process
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state, local and foreign jurisdictions impose substantial requirements on the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of new drug and biologic products. The FDA, through regulations that implement the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDCA”), and other laws and comparable regulations for other agencies, regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, shipping, approval, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, sale, export, import and distribution of such products. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturers of our products, including holds on clinical research, civil or criminal fines or other penalties, product recalls, or seizures, or total or partial suspension of production or injunctions, refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the U.S., refusals of the FDA to grant approval of drugs or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecutions.
Before human clinical testing in the U.S. of a new drug compound or biological product can commence, an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), application is required to be submitted to the FDA. The IND application includes results of pre-clinical animal studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug and a detailed description of the clinical investigations to be undertaken.

17



Clinical trials are normally done in three phases, although the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials are smaller trials concerned primarily with metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug and with the safety of the product. Phase 2 trials are designed primarily to demonstrate effectiveness and safety in treating the disease or condition for which the product is indicated. These trials typically explore various doses and regimens. Phase 3 trials are expanded clinical trials intended to gather additional information on safety and effectiveness needed to clarify the product’s benefit-risk relationship and generate information for proper labeling of the drug, among other things. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk is presented to patients. When data is required from long-term use of a drug following its approval and initial marketing, the FDA can require Phase 4, or post-marketing, studies to be conducted.
With certain exceptions, once successful clinical testing is completed, the sponsor can submit a NDA, for approval of a drug, or a Biologic License Application (“BLA”), for biologics such as vaccines, which will be reviewed, and if successful, approved by the FDA, allowing the product to be marketed. The process of completing clinical trials for a new drug is likely to take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Furthermore, the FDA or any foreign health authority may not grant an approval on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny the approval of a NDA or BLA, in its sole discretion, if it determines that its regulatory criteria have not been satisfied or may require additional testing or information. Among the conditions for marketing approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to good manufacturing practice regulations. In complying with standards contained in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and quality assurance to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by, or under the authority of, the FDA and by other federal, state, local or foreign agencies.
Even after initial FDA or foreign health authority approval has been obtained, further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies, may be required to provide additional data on safety and will be required to gain approval for the marketing of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested. For certain drugs intended to treat serious, life-threatening conditions that show great promise in earlier testing, the FDA can also grant conditional approval. However, drug developers are required to study the drug further and verify clinical benefit as part of the conditional approval provision, and the FDA can revoke approval if later testing does not reproduce previous findings. The FDA may also condition approval of a product on the sponsor agreeing to certain mitigation strategies that can limit the unfettered marketing of a drug. Also, the FDA or foreign regulatory authority will require post-marketing reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the product. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including any change in indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing facility, an application seeking approval of such changes will likely be required to be submitted to the FDA or foreign regulatory authority.
In the U.S., the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of drug, biological, medical device and food products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, fines, recall or seizure of products, refusal to permit products to be imported into the U.S., refusal of the government to approve product approval applications or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications and criminal prosecution. The FDA may also assess civil penalties for violations of the FDCA involving medical devices.
For biodefense development, such as with RiVax®, the FDA has instituted policies that are expected to result in shorter pathways to market. This potentially includes approval for commercial use utilizing the results of animal efficacy trials, rather than efficacy trials in humans. However, we will still have to establish that the vaccine and countermeasures it is developing are safe in humans at doses that are correlated with the beneficial effect in animals. Such clinical trials will also have to be completed in distinct populations that are subject to the countermeasures; for instance, the very young and the very old, and in pregnant women, if the countermeasure is to be licensed for civilian use. Other agencies will have an influence over the benefit-risk scenarios for deploying the countermeasures and in establishing the number of doses utilized in the Strategic National Stockpile. We may not be able to sufficiently demonstrate the animal correlation to the satisfaction of the FDA, as these correlates are difficult to establish and are often unclear. Invocation of the animal rule may raise issues of confidence in the model systems even if the models have been validated. For many of the biological threats, the animal models are not available and we may have to develop the animal models, a time-consuming research effort. There are few historical precedents, or recent precedents, for the development of new countermeasure for bioterrorism agents. Despite the animal rule, the FDA may require large clinical trials to establish safety and immunogenicity before licensure and it may require 

18



safety and immunogenicity trials in additional populations. Approval of biodefense products may be subject to post-marketing studies, and could be restricted in use in only certain populations.
Vaccines are approved under the BLA process that exists under the Public Health Service Act. In addition to the greater technical challenges associated with developing biologics, the potential for generic competition is lower for a BLA product than a small molecule product subject to a NDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, a “generic” version of a biologic is known as a biosimilar and the barriers to entry – whether legal, scientific, or logistical – for a biosimilar version of a biologic approved under a BLA are higher.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition – generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug or biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug or biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug or biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

19



Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Paediatric Investigation Plan
​
As part of the regulatory process for the registration of new medicines with the EMA and the MHRA, pharmaceutical companies are required to provide a PIP outlining the Company’s strategy for investigation of the new medicinal products in the paediatric population. In some instances, a waiver negating the need for a PIP for certain conditions may be granted by the EMA or MHRA when development of a medicine for use in children is not feasible or appropriate.
​
Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway
​
The ILAP was launched in the UK at the start of 2021 to accelerate the development and access to promising medicines, thereby facilitating patient access to new medicines. The pathway, part of the UK’s plan to attract life sciences development in the post-Brexit era, features enhanced input and interactions with the MHRA and other stakeholders including the NICE, and the SMC. The decision to award the Innovation Passport is made by an ILAP Steering Group, which is comprised of representatives from MHRA, NICE, and SMC. The Innovation Passport designation is the first step in the ILAP process and triggers the MHRA and its partner agencies to create a target development profile to chart out a roadmap for regulatory and development milestones with the goal of early patient access in the UK. Other benefits of ILAP include a 150-day accelerated assessment, rolling review and a continuous benefit risk assessment.
​
Early Access to Medicines Scheme
Launched in April 2014 in the United Kingdom by the MHRA, the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (“EAMS”) offers severely ill patients with life-threatening and seriously debilitating conditions the lifeline of trying ground-breaking new medicines earlier than they would normally be accessible. PIM designation is the first phase of EAMS and is awarded following an assessment of early nonclinical and clinical data by the MHRA. The criteria product candidates must meet to obtain PIM designation are:

● | Criterion 1 – The condition should be life-threatening or seriously debilitating with a high unmet medical need (i.e., there is no method of treatment, diagnosis or prevention available or existing methods have serious limitations).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Criterion 2 – The medicinal product is likely to offer major advantage over methods currently used in the UK.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Criterion 3 – The potential adverse effects of the medicinal product are likely to be outweighed by the benefits, allowing for the reasonable expectation of a positive benefit risk balance. A positive benefit risk balance should be based on preliminary scientific evidence that the safety profile of the medicinal product is likely to be manageable and acceptable in relation to the estimated benefits.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

False Claims Laws
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government.
Anti-Kickback Laws
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in 

20



return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.
United States Healthcare Reform
Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers
Drug substance and drug product manufacturing is outsourced to qualified suppliers. We do not have manufacturing capabilities/infrastructure and do not intend to develop the capacity to manufacture drug products substances. We have agreements with third-party manufacturers to supply bulk drug substances for our product candidates and with third parties to formulate, package and distribute our product candidates. Our employees include professionals with expertise in pharmaceutical manufacturing development, quality assurance and third-party supplier management who oversee work conducted by third-party companies. We believe that we have on hand or can easily obtain sufficient amounts of product candidates to complete our currently contemplated clinical trials. All of the drug substances used in our product candidates currently are manufactured by single suppliers. While we have not experienced any supply disruptions, the number of manufacturers of the drug substances is limited. In the event it is necessary or advisable to acquire supplies from alternative suppliers, assuming commercially reasonable terms could be reached, the challenge would be the efficient transfer of technology and know-how from current manufactures to the new supplier. Formulation and distribution of our finished product candidates also currently are conducted by single suppliers but we believe that alternative sources for these services are readily available on commercially reasonable terms, subject to the efficient transfer of technology and know-how from current suppliers to the new supplier.
All of the current agreements for the supply of bulk drug substances for our product candidates and for the formulation or distribution of our product candidates relate solely to the development (including preclinical and clinical) of our product candidates. Under these contracts, our product candidates are manufactured upon our order of a specific quantity. In the event that we obtain marketing approval for a product candidate, we will qualify secondary suppliers for all key manufacturing activities supporting the marketing application.
Marketing and Collaboration
We do not currently have any sales and marketing capability, other than to potentially market our biodefense vaccine products directly to government agencies. With respect to other commercialization efforts, we currently intend to seek distribution and other collaboration arrangements for the sales and marketing of any product candidate that is approved, while also evaluating the potential to commercialize on our own in orphan disease indications. From time to time, we have had and are having strategic discussions with potential collaboration partners for our biodefense vaccine product 

21



candidates, although no assurance can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more collaboration agreements for our product candidate on acceptable terms, if at all. We believe that both military and civilian health authorities of the U.S. and other countries will increase their stockpiling of therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent diseases and conditions that could ensue following a bioterrorism attack.
On December 20, 2012, we re-acquired the North American and European commercial rights to BDP through an amendment of our collaboration and supply agreement with Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is now known as Leadiant Biosciences, Inc. (“Leadiant”). The amendment requires us to make certain approval and commercialization milestone payments to Leadiant which could reach up to $6 million. In addition, we have agreed to pay Leadiant: (a) a royalty amount equal to 3% of all net sales of BDP made directly by us, and any third-party partner and/or their respective affiliates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and in each country in the European Territory for the later to occur of: (i) a period of ten years from the first commercial sale of BDP in each country, or (ii) the expiration of our patents and patent applications relating to BDP in such country (the “Payment Period”); and (b) 15% of all up-front payments, milestone payments and any other consideration (exclusive of equity payments) received by us and/or a potential partner from us and/or potential partner’s licensees, distributors and agents for BDP in each relevant country in the territory, which amount will be paid on a product-by-product and a country-by-country basis for the Payment Period.
On August 25, 2013, we entered into an agreement with SciClone, pursuant to which SciClone provided us with access to its oral mucositis clinical and regulatory data library in exchange for exclusive commercialization rights for SGX942 in the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau, subject to the negotiation of economic terms. SciClone’s data library was generated from two sequential Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in 2010 and 2012 evaluating SciClone’s compound, SCV-07, for the treatment of oral mucositis caused by chemoradiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients, before SciClone terminated its program. By analyzing data available from the placebo subjects in the SciClone trials, we acquired valuable insight into disease progression, along with quantitative understanding of its incidence and severity in the head and neck cancer patient population. This information assisted us with the design of the SGX942 Phase 2 clinical trial, in which positive preliminary results were announced in December 2015.
On September 9, 2016, we and SciClone entered into an exclusive license agreement, pursuant to which we granted rights to SciClone to develop, promote, market, distribute and sell SGX942 in the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam. Under the terms of the license agreement, SciClone will be responsible for all aspects of development, product registration and commercialization in the territories, having access to data generated by us. In exchange for exclusive rights, SciClone will pay us royalties on net sales, and we will supply commercial drug product to SciClone on a cost-plus basis, while maintaining worldwide manufacturing rights. We also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with SciClone pursuant to which we sold 23,530 shares of our common stock to SciClone for approximately $127.50 per share, for an aggregate price of $3 million.
Competition
Our competitors are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. Universities and other research institutions, including the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, also compete in the development of treatment technologies, and we face competition from other companies to acquire rights to those technologies.
HyBryte™ Competition
The FDA has approved several treatments for later stages (IIB-IV) of CTCL and/or in conditions that are unresponsive to prior treatment. Three are targeted therapies (Targretin®-caps, Ontak® and Adcetris®), two are histone deacetylases inhibitors (Zolina® and Istodax®) and the remaining two are topical therapies (Valchor® and Targretin®-gel). There are currently no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of front-line, early stage (I-IIA) CTCL; however certain topical chemotherapies and topical, radiation, photodynamic and other therapies which are approved for indications other than CTCL are prescribed off-label for the treatment of early stage CTCL. These include narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) light therapy and psoralen combined with ultraviolet A UVA light therapy (“PUVA”); however, PUVA treatments are usually limited to three times per week and 200 times in total due to the potentially carcinogenic side effect, while NB UVB is known to be effective against patches but less so against plaque lesions, common in early stage CTCL. There are other drugs currently in development that may have the potential to be used in early stage (I-IIA) CTCL, primarily in early Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. Other treatments for later stage disease are not considered direct competitors.

22



SGX94/942 Competition
Because SGX94 (dusquetide) uses a novel mechanism of action in combating bacterial infections, there are no direct competitors at this time. Bacterial infections are routinely treated with antibiotics and SGX94 treatment is anticipated to be utilized primarily where antibiotics are insufficient (e.g., due to antibiotic resistance) or contra-indicated (e.g., in situations where the development of antibiotic resistance is a significant concern). Many groups are working on the antibiotic resistance problem and research into the innate immune system is intensifying, making emerging competition likely (from companies such as Celtaxsys Inc., Innaxon Therapeutics and Innate Pharma SA).
There is currently one drug approved for the treatment of oral mucositis in hematological cancer (palifermin). There are currently no approved drugs for treatment of oral mucositis in cancers with solid tumors (e.g., head and neck cancer). There are several drugs in clinical development for oral mucositis – two in Phase 3 (brilacidin by Innovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and a mucobuccal tablet by Monopar Therapeutics LLC) and one submitted for a NDA (GC4419 by Galera Therapeutics, Inc.). There are various natural products in small and/or open label studies (including sage, turmeric, honey and olive oil). In addition, there are medical devices approved for the treatment of oral mucositis including MuGard®, GelClair®, Episil®, and Caphosol®. These devices attempt to create a protective barrier around the oral ulceration with no biologic activity in treating the underlying disease.
Oral BDP Competition
There are a number of approved treatments for Crohn’s disease and additional compounds are in late-stage development.
Enbrel® (etanercept), Remicade® (infliximab) and Humira® (adalimumab) are currently approved for the treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease; however, all carry significant Black Box warnings in their labeling for increased risk of serious infection and malignancy, and therefore are approved for treatment of moderate to severe patients. Entocort® (enteric-coated budesonide) is currently approved for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the lower GI tract (ileum and/or the ascending colon) in patients eight years of age and older who weigh more than 25 kilograms. There is one other marketed biologic, Tysabri® (natalizumab), in a Phase 2 study for pediatric Crohn’s.
ThermoVax® Competition
Multiple groups and companies are working to address the unmet need of vaccine thermostability using a variety of technologies. In addition, other organizations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and PATH, have programs designed to advance technologies to address this need.
Several stabilization technologies currently being developed involve mixing vaccine antigen +/- adjuvant with various proprietary excipients or co-factors that either serve to stabilize the vaccine or biological product in a liquid or dried (lyophilized) form. Examples of these approaches include the use of various plant-derived sugars and macromolecules being developed by companies such as iosBio. Variation Biotechnologies, Inc. (“VBI”) is developing a lipid system (resembling liposomes) to stabilize viral antigens, including virus-like particles (“VLPs”), and for potential application to a conventional influenza vaccine among others.
Additionally, companies like Altimmune, Inc., and Panacea Biotec Ltd., and Compass Biotech Inc. are developing proprietary vaccines with the application of some form of stabilization technology.
Public Health Solutions Competition
We face competition in the area of biodefense product development from various public and private companies, universities and governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Army, some of whom may have their own proprietary technologies which may directly compete with our technologies.
The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the DoD’s lead laboratory for medical research to counter biological threats is also developing a ricin vaccine candidate, RVEc™. RVEc™ has been shown to be fully protective in mice exposed to lethal doses of ricin toxin by the aerosol route. Further studies, in both rabbits and nonhuman primates, were conducted to evaluate RVEc™’s safety as well as its immunogenicity, with positive results observed. No further data

has been released in recent years. A monoclonal antibody is also being developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. as a ricin therapeutic, with administration 4 hours after exposure demonstrating efficacy while administration 12 hours after ricin exposure was not protective in animal models.
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary knowledge and experience that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
In 2014, we acquired a novel PDT that utilizes safe visible light for activation, which we refer to as HyBryte™. The active ingredient in HyBryte™ is synthetic hypericin, a photosensitizer which is topically applied to skin lesions and then activated by fluorescent light 16 to 24 hours later. As part of the acquisition, we acquired a license agreement relating to the use of photo-activated hypericin, composition of matter patent for HyBryte™ (U.S. patent 8,629,302) and additional issued and pending applications, both in the U.S. and abroad. U.S. patent 8,629,302 is expected to expire in September 2030. In August 2018, we were granted a U.S. patent (No. 10,053,513) titled “Systems and Methods for Producing Synthetic Hypericin.” This newly issued patent, expected to expire in 2036, broadens the production around synthetic hypericin. Our proprietary formulation of synthetic hypericin also has been granted a European patent for the treatment of psoriasis, EP 2571507, and complements the method of treatment claims covered by the previously issued U.S. patent 6001882, Photoactivated hypericin and the use thereof. Further, on January 7, 2020, we also were granted a U.S. patent (No. 10,526,268) titled “Systems and Methods for Producing Synthetic Hypericin”, which further expanded protection for the composition of purified synthetic hypericin. This patent is also expected to expire in 2036. Patent protection is also pursued worldwide with similar patents and expiry dates.
In addition to issued and pending patents, we also have “Orphan Drug” designations for HyBryte™ in the U.S. and the EU for CTCL, SGX203 in the U.S. for pediatric Crohn’s disease, as well as for RiVax® in the U.S. and EU. Our Orphan Drug designations provide for seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and ten years exclusivity in Europe. We have pending patent applications for this indication that, if granted, may extend our anticipated marketing exclusivity beyond the U.S. seven year or EU ten year post-approval exclusivity provided by Orphan Drug legislation.
In 2013, we expanded our patent portfolio to include innate defense regulation through the acquisition of the novel drug technology, known as SGX94. By binding to the pivotal regulatory protein p62, also known as sequestosome-1, SGX94 regulates the innate immune system to reduce inflammation, eliminate infection and enhance healing. As part of the acquisition, we acquired all rights, including composition of matter patents for SGX94 as well as other analogs and crystal structures of SGX94 with its protein target p62, including U.S. patent 8,124,721 (expiring 2028), 9,416,157 (expiring 2028) and 8,791,061 (expiring 2029), both in the U.S. and abroad. SGX94 was developed pursuant to discoveries made by Professors B. Brett Finlay and Robert Hancock of University of British Columbia (“UBC”). We also have rights to the background technology patents (U.S. patent numbers 7,507,787 [expiring 2024], 7,687,454 [expiring 2026] and 11,311,598 [expiring 2034]). The U.S. Patent Office has also granted patents titled “Novel Peptides and Analogs for Use in the Treatment of Oral Mucositis.” The issued patents (U.S. patent numbers 9,850.279 and 10,253,068, both expiring in 2034) claim therapeutic use of dusquetide and related IDR analogs, and adds to composition of matter claims for dusquetide and related analogs that have been granted in the U.S. and worldwide.
We have issued U.S. patent 8,263,582 that covers the use of BDP for treating inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, which patent expired on March 15, 2022. We also have European patent EP 1392321 claiming the use of topically active corticosteroids in orally administered dosage forms that act concurrently to treat inflammation in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, as well as European patent EP 2242477 claiming the use of orally ingested BDP for treatment of 

24



interstitial lung disease. European patents EP 1392321 and EP 2242477 expired in March 2022 and expire on January 2029, respectively.
The subject of U.S. patent application number 12/633,631 filed December 8, 2009 and continued into patent application 15/495,798 filed April 24, 2017 and corresponding European patent application number 09836727.9, which was granted a patent 2373160 in October 2017 and pursued in multiple European countries, is the use of topically active BDP in radiation and chemotherapeutics injury. Additionally, we have numerous patent filings currently issued or pending in foreign jurisdictions covering this subject matter, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.
ThermoVax® is the subject of U.S. patents 8,444,991 (expiring February 2030) and 8,808,710 (expiring March 2028) both issued on May 21, 2013 titled “Method of Preparing an Immunologically-Active Adjuvant-Bound Dried Vaccine Composition” and licensed to us by VitriVax, Inc. ThermoVax® is also U.S. patent application number 15/694.023 filed September 17, 2017 titled “Thermostable Vaccine Compositions and Methods of Preparing Same” and jointly invented by the UC and the Company. The patent application and the corresponding foreign filings are pending or granted and they address the use of adjuvants in conjunction with vaccines that are formulated to resist thermal inactivation. The license agreement covers thermostable alum-adjuvanted vaccines for ricin toxin and Ebola virus. An additional patent, covering vaccine combinations such as ricin toxin and anthrax, was filed in 2015 and granted on May 21, 2019 in the U.S. (No. 10,293,041, titled “Multivalent Stable Vaccine Composition and Methods of Making Same”) and is expected to expire in 2035. A patent for unique, proprietary compositions and methods directed to combinations of glycoprotein antigens with nanoemulsion adjuvants comprising sucrose fatty acid esters prior to lyophilization was filed in 2020, granted in 2022 and expiring in 2040 (No. 11,433,129 titled “Compositions and Methods of Manufacturing Trivalent Filovirus Vaccines.”) Patent protection is also pursued worldwide with similar patents and expiry dates.
Additional vaccine thermostabilization patents specific for anti-viral vaccines, including filovirus and coronavirus have been filed but are not yet granted. If granted, expiry dates would range from 2040 to 2041. Patent protection is also pursued worldwide with similar patents and expiry dates.
HyBryte™ License Agreement
In September 2014, we acquired a worldwide exclusive license agreement with New York University and Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd. for the rights to a novel PDT that utilizes safe visible light for activation, which we refer to as HyBryte™. To maintain this license, we are obligated to pay $25,000 in annual license fees. In addition, we will pay the licensors: (a) a royalty amount equal to 3% of all net sales of HyBryte™ made directly by us and/or any affiliates; (b) a royalty amount equal to 2.5% of all net sales of HyBryte™ made by our sublicensees, subject to stated maximums and (c) 20% of all payments, not based on net sales, received by us from our sublicensees. This license may be terminated by either party upon notice of a material breach by the other party that is not cured within the applicable cure period. The exclusive license includes rights to several issued U.S. patents, including U.S. patent numbers 6,867,235 and 7,122,518, among other domestic and foreign patent applications. U.S. Patent numbers 6,867,235 and 7,122,518 expired in January 2020 and is expected to expire in November 2023, respectively.
We acquired the license agreement for HyBryte™ and related intangible assets, including U.S. patent 8,629,302, properties and rights pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Hy Biopharma Inc. (“Hy Biopharma”). As consideration for the assets acquired, we initially paid $275,000 in cash and issued 12,328 shares of common stock with a market value of $3,750,000, and in March 2020 we issued 130,413 shares of common stock at a value of $5,000,000 (based upon an effective per share price of $38.40) as a result of HyBryte™ demonstrating statistical significant treatment response in the Phase 3 clinical trial. Provided the final success-orientated milestone is attained, we will be required to make a payment of up to $5 million, if and when achieved, payable in our common stock.
SGX94 License Agreements
On December 18, 2012, we acquired a first in class drug technology, known as SGX94 (dusquetide), representing a novel approach to modulation of the innate immune system. SGX94 is an IDR that regulates the innate immune system to reduce inflammation, eliminate infection and enhance tissue healing by binding to the pivotal regulatory protein p62, also known as sequestosome-1. As part of the acquisition, we acquired all rights, including composition of matter patents, preclinical and Phase 1 clinical study datasets for SGX94. We also assumed a license agreement with UBC to advance the research and 

25



development of the SGX94 technology. The license agreement with UBC provides us with exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, distribute, market sell and/or license or sublicense products derived or developed from this technology. Under the license agreement we are obligated to pay UBC (i) an annual license maintenance fee of CAD $1,000, and (ii) milestone payments which could reach up to CAD $1.2 million. This license agreement (a) will automatically terminate if we file, or become subject to an involuntary filing, for bankruptcy, and (b) may be terminated by UBC in the event of, among other things, our insolvency, dissolution, grant of a security interest in the technology licensed to us pursuant to the license agreement, or material breach of or failure to perform material obligations under the license agreement or other research agreements between us and UBC.
Oral BDP License Agreement
On November 24, 1998, the Company, known at the time as Enteron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Enteron”) and George B. McDonald (“Dr. McDonald”) entered into an exclusive license agreement for the rights to intellectual property, including know-how, relating to BDP. We have an exclusive license to commercially exploit the covered products worldwide, subject to Dr. McDonald’s right to make and use the technology for research purposes and the U.S. Government’s right to use the technology for government purposes. Pursuant to the license agreement, as amended, we are required to (i) reimburse Dr. McDonald for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Dr. McDonald in connection with the patent applications and issued patents, (ii) pay Dr. McDonald $300,000 upon approval by the FDA of our first NDA incorporating BDP; (iii) pay Dr. McDonald royalty payments equal to 3% of net sales of the covered products and (iv) pay Dr. McDonald $400,000 in cash upon an approval of BDP by the European Medicines Agency.
Additionally, in the event that we sublicense our rights under the license agreement, we will be required to pay Dr. McDonald 10% of any sublicense fees and royalty payments paid by the sublicense to us.
The term of the license agreement expires upon the expiration of the licensed patent applications or patents. Dr. McDonald has the right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety or to terminate exclusivity under the agreement if we or its sublicenses have not commercialized or are not actively attempting to commercialize a covered product.
Additionally, the agreement terminates: (i) automatically upon us becoming insolvent; (ii) upon 30 days’ notice, if we breach any obligation under the agreement without curing such breach during the notice period; and (iii) upon 90 days’ notice by us. After any termination, we will have the right to sell our inventory for a period not to exceed three months following the date of termination, subject to the payment of the amounts owed under the agreement.
ThermoVax® License Agreement
On December 21, 2010, we executed a worldwide exclusive license agreement with the UC for ThermoVax®, which is the subject of U.S. patent number 8,444,991 issued on May 21, 2013 titled “Method of Preparing an Immunologically-Active Adjuvant-Bound Dried Vaccine Composition.” This patent and its corresponding foreign filings are licensed to us by the UC and they address the use of adjuvants in conjunction with vaccines that are formulated to resist thermal inactivation. U.S. Patent 8,444,991 is expected to expire in December 2031. The license agreement also covers thermostable vaccines for biodefense as well as other potential vaccine indications. In addition, we, in conjunction with UC, filed domestic and foreign patent applications claiming priority back to a provisional application filed on May 17, 2011 titled: “Thermostable Vaccine Compositions and Methods of Preparing Same.” In April 2018, the UC delivered a notice of termination of our license agreement based upon our failure to achieve one of the development milestones: initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial of the heat stabilization technology by March 31, 2018. After negotiating with the UC, we and the UC agreed to extend the termination date to October 31, 2018 in order to allow us time to agree upon a potential agreement that would allow us to keep the rights to, and to continue to develop, the heat stabilization technology or a product candidate containing the heat stabilization technology in our field of use.
On October 31, 2018, in a series of related transactions, (a) we and the UC agreed to terminate the original license agreement, (b) the UC and VitriVax executed a worldwide exclusive license agreement for the heat stabilization technology for all fields of use, and (c) we and VitriVax executed a worldwide exclusive sublicense agreement, which was amended and restated in October 2020, for the heat stabilization technology for use in the fields of ricin and Ebola vaccines. We paid a $100,000 sublicense fee on the effective date of the sublicense agreement. Under the amended sublicense agreement to maintain the sublicense we are obliged to pay a minimum annual royalty of $20,000 until first commercial sale of a sublicensed product, upon which point, we will be required to pay an earned royalty of 2% of net sales subject to a minimum 

26



royalty of $50,000 each year. We are also required to pay royalties on any sub-sublicense income based on a declining percentage of all sub-sublicense income calculated within the contractual period until reaching a minimum of 15% after two years. In addition, we are required to pay VitriVax milestone fees of: (a) $25,000 upon initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of the sublicensed product, (b) $100,000 upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the sublicensed product, (c) $100,000 upon regulatory approval of a sublicensed product, and (d) $1 million upon achieving $10 million in aggregate net sales of a sublicensed product in the U.S. or equivalent. To date none of these milestones have been met.
RiVax® License Agreement
In June 2003, we executed a worldwide exclusive option to license patent applications with UTSW for the nasal, pulmonary and oral uses of a non-toxic ricin vaccine. In June 2004, we entered into a license agreement with UTSW for the injectable rights to the ricin vaccine and, in October 2004, we negotiated the remaining oral rights to the ricin vaccine. To maintain this license, we are obligated to pay $50,000 in annual license fees. Through this license, we have rights to the issued patent number 7,175,848 titled “Ricin A chain mutants lacking enzymatic activity as vaccines to protect against aerosolized ricin.” This patent includes methods of use and composition claims for RiVax®.
CoVaccine HT™ License Agreement
In April 2020, we executed an agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of CoVaccine HT™, a novel vaccine adjuvant, from BTG, a division of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX), for the fields of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19 and pandemic flu. The agreement was executed with Protherics Medicines Development, one of the companies that make up the BTG specialty pharmaceuticals business, which owns the CoVaccine HT™ intellectual property.
Research and Development Expenditures
We spent approximately $7.9 million and $8.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on research and development. The amounts we spent on research and development per product during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
