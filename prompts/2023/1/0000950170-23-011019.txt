 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a producer and marketer of innovative, plant-based food and beverage products. Our history as a leader in science-based approaches to developing high value crop improvements, primarily in wheat, designed to enhance farm economics by improving the performance of crops in the field, as well as their value as food ingredients, has laid the foundation for our path forward. We have used non-genetically modified (“non-GMO”) advanced breeding techniques to develop these proprietary innovations which we are now commercializing through the sales of seed and grain, food ingredients and products, trait licensing and royalty agreements. The acquisition of the assets of Live Zola, LLC (“Zola”) added coconut water to our portfolio of products.
 Our commercial strategy is to satisfy consumer nutrition demands with the superior functional benefits our crops deliver directly from the farm, enabling us to share premium economics throughout the ag-food supply chain and to build a world-class estate of high value traits and varieties. The acquisition of the Zola brand allows us to broaden our reach within the beverage sector.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
 •Accelerate the monetization of our GoodWheat wheat trait portfolio. Our proprietary intellectual property ("IP") with multiple non-GMO wheat traits have clear functional benefits, and we will continue to build partnerships across the wheat value chain. This will include launching GoodWheat into multiple categories where our wheat can provide a compelling point-of-difference at attractive margins. We will continue to acquire, develop and retain the requisite management and industry experience to fully participate in, and control, the route to market for our high value food ingredients.
 •Evaluate acquisitive growth opportunities. We intend to evaluate potential acquisitions that will allow us to bring the GoodWheat value proposition to an existing business. We believe there is a significant opportunity to scale our business faster by purchasing an existing business in a new wheat-based category outside of pasta.
 •Scale Zola through retail expansion. We plan to expand distribution of our Zola coconut water brand through mass market retailers and grocery store chains. Based on our research, consumers prefer the clean, crisp taste of Zola to that of other leading coconut water brands. As a result, we plan to refresh our packaging, launch new innovation and continue to invest in effective brand-building activities.
Arcadia Wellness, LLC
 In May 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary Arcadia Wellness, LLC (“Arcadia Wellness” or “AW”), acquired the businesses of Eko, Lief, and Zola. The acquisition included consumer CBD brands like Soul Spring, a CBD-infused botanical therapy brand in the natural category, Saavy Naturals, a line of natural body care products and ProVault, a CBD-infused sports performance formula made with natural ingredients, providing effective support and recovery for athletes. Also included in the purchase is Zola, a coconut water sourced exclusively with sustainably grown coconuts from Thailand. On July 8, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to license Saavy Naturals to Radiance Beauty and Wellness, Inc. ("Radiance Beauty").
Our Product Portfolio
 GoodWheat Consumer Products
 In June 2022, we launched our GoodWheat pasta in five varieties – penne, spaghetti, fettuccine, elbows and rotini – in select retailers nationwide and on Amazon. Our pasta delivers 4 times the fiber of traditional wheat pasta with 9g

of protein per serving and no sacrifice on taste. In fact, our research shows that GoodWheat pasta scores at parity on taste with leading wheat pasta competitors and significantly outscores market leading vegetable-based pastas. Made with only our USA farm grown wheat, GoodWheat pasta meets consumers’ preference for clean labels and transparent sourcing. And, in December of 2022, GoodWheat received the American Heart Association’s Heart-Check mark on all of our pasta products. With its high fiber, lower sodium and zero saturated fat, GoodWheat meets the criteria for a heart-healthy pasta and provides consumers with a better-for-you option that delivers superior nutrition with the taste and texture of traditional pasta.
Most Americans suffer from a significant fiber deficiency. Less than 10 percent of women and less than 3 percent of men get enough fiber in their daily diets. The recommended daily value of fiber is 25g for women and children, and 38g for men according to the May 2021 Food and Health Survey by the International Food Information Council. One serving of GoodWheat Pasta gets your fiber closer to your daily need, delivering 8g of fiber, which accounts for 32 percent of the daily value of fiber needs for women and children, and 20 percent for men. 
In 2023, we plan to expand the GoodWheat portfolio with the launch of innovative, new wheat-based products in additional categories, offering consumers more options to improve their fiber intake at multiple mealtimes throughout the day.
 Zola Coconut Water
 Zola is a pure, natural, 100% coconut water with a crisp, clean taste that’s lightly sweet and refreshing. Naturally hydrating and never from concentrate, Zola is Non-GMO Project Verified and only contains 60 calories per serving. In taste tests, Zola beats competitors 2 to 1 and is the best-tasting way to rehydrate, reset and reenergize.
CBD Body Care ProVault Topical Pain Relief
 Our portfolio currently consists of two body care brands that both contain CBD. The first brand is ProVault, a muscle and joint pain relief product that is formulated with THC-free CBD isolate along with a proprietary blend of natural ingredients and fast-acting cooling agents. The second brand is SoulSpring, a CBD-infused line of bath and body products that includes nourishing botanicals and minerals.
The market for CBD products has been under pressure primarily due to regulatory uncertainty. Given our strategic focus on food and beverage products, we are currently in the process of exploring strategic alternatives for our body care brands.
GoodWheat Wheat Traits
 Enhanced Quality Grains
 The GoodWheat brand also encompasses our current and future non-GMO wheat portfolio of high fiber Resistant Starch ("RS"), Reduced Gluten ("RG") wheat varieties, and extended shelf life wheat, as well as future wheat innovations. We now hold more than 15 global patents on our high fiber RS wheat, protecting both bread wheat and durum (pasta) wheat. Claims granted recently strengthen our IP for our RS portfolio of products.
 Our GoodWheat wheat traits redesign wheat as a functional food adding value to the wheat supply chain by enabling a wider range of choices to meet consumer demands. One such program generated multiple bread wheat and pasta wheat lines with very high levels of amylose, leading to increased levels of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. High fiber resistant starch wheat can deliver fiber and other benefits to refined white flour products and also whole grain food products. We believe improving the fiber content of wheat can deliver improved health benefits to a wide population.


High Fiber RS Wheat
 Our high fiber RS wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources. Currently, corn resistant starch is a product in two market segments: dietary fiber additives and modified starch additives. Major growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our RS wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more than eight times higher than the control. RS wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company.
 RS wheat bread flour is currently being introduced to North American bakery and consumer packaged goods ("CPG") companies by our partners, Bay State Milling. In markets outside North America, RS wheat is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery, ready-to-eat cereals and pasta products with industrial partners. We have many RS wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.
 RG Wheat
 Many consumers are interested in reducing levels of gluten in their diet. Critically, for some, this is due to having Celiac disease ("CD"), an autoimmune disease that impacts many people worldwide with estimates from 1% of the population in Europe to 3.5% in Mexico. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity ("NCGS") impacts an estimated additional 6% of the population. Both CD and NCGS are characterized by sensitivity to dietary gluten. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to accomplish for average consumers, efforts to develop alternative approaches are needed.
 Arcadia is continuing to advance a new wheat variety with reduced gluten levels. Our proprietary, non-GMO wheat variety developed using advanced screening and plant breeding techniques have reduced allergenic glutens and increased essential amino acids such as lysine, along with all the other health benefits of high protein wheat. Importantly, this variety also delivers impressively high fiber content at approximately 14 grams per serving compared to 2-3 grams per serving of traditional wheat, providing additional value to health-conscious consumers as well as optionality as we advance the commercialization of this project. We are breeding the trait into additional commercial wheat varieties and working with food processors to give people a choice to enjoy higher quality wheat in the products they love while reducing gluten in their diet.
 Improved Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour
 The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that “at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich” due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in milled whole grain flour as it progresses through the supply chain. Whole wheat flour from these lines is being tested further for sensory characteristics and improved shelf-life stability. This new trait could help improve the shelf life and flavor profile of whole grain products, thus reducing formulation costs and increasing consumer preference and palatability for whole grains.
Product Development
 With our food, beverage and wellness products now entering the market, we are firmly in the commercialization phase of our corporate lifecycle. We are de-emphasizing new trait discovery research and development (“R&D”) and are increasing our focus on food-science innovation to fully leverage the value in our existing superior wheat genetics. We are evolving our organizational capabilities to match this strategy progression to include in-house food formulation and CPG supply chain expertise.


Food Formulation Innovation. We will expand the application of our innovation platform to build on our pipeline of products focused on health and wellness. Our innovation team is focused on using science-based solutions to leverage our wheat and hemp varieties to develop an array of food products and wellness ingredients. Because we are innovating directly from our own well-established plant technology traits, we expect this extension of our involvement will provide more meaningful improvements.
 Field Trials and Breeder & Foundation Seed Production. Our trait evaluation and development staff conducts field operations for both trials and production in American Falls, Idaho, and oversee production in other areas of the country, as needed. Similarly, regulatory trials may be needed to develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.
 Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic and location information for all our plant materials. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. We ensure all of our plant materials are accounted for, tracked and inventoried, which enables us to maintain direct control and proper documentation.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned or exclusively controlled 70 issued patents, 38 pending patent applications worldwide, and 6 plant variety protection certificates. These totals reflect the following: (i) with respect to the U.S. territory, we owned 23 and exclusively in-licensed 2 U.S. issued patents, and we owned 6 U.S. patent applications and 6 plant variety protection certificates relating to our plants, trait technologies, and business methods; and (ii) in connection with foreign territories, we owned 26 and exclusively in-licensed 19 foreign issued patents, and owned 32 pending foreign patent applications. As of December 31, 2022, our GoodWheat® portfolio included 12 U.S. issued patents, 6 U.S. patent applications, 1 plant variety certificate, 23 foreign issued patents and 25 foreign patent applications. With respect to all of the foregoing patent and plant protection assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.
As of December 31, 2022, Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. and Arcadia Wellness, LLC had nine and eight registered trademarks in the United States, respectively. We also have eleven registered trademarks in various other countries.
Key Collaborations
 We have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed close relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. We believe that the expertise and opportunities created by these collaborations represent important assets to our business. Below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.
Corteva Agriscience
 In 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Corteva Agriscience to jointly develop and commercialize a breakthrough improved wheat quality trait in North America. The collaboration leverages our TILLING platform

with Corteva Agriscience’s enabling technology platforms, high-quality elite germplasm and global commercial channels.
 Under the collaboration, the companies will further develop and commercialize an improved wheat quality trait, which has completed initial field trials and is advancing to next-stage field trials. Corteva Agriscience will introgress Arcadia’s trait into its proprietary elite germplasm lines and manage all aspects related to the trait commercialization. Certain development costs will be co-funded, and we will share in the commercial value resulting from products produced.
 Arista Cereal Seeds Pty Ltd and Bay State Milling Company
 In 2019, we entered into an agreement with Arista and Bay State Milling ("BSM"). Under the agreement, BSM is the exclusive commercial partner for our high fiber resistant starch bread wheat in North America under its HealthSense brand portfolio, while Arista has exclusive rights under our high fiber resistant starch bread wheat intellectual property in certain geographies, including Australia and Europe. We will continue to market our high fiber wheat under our GoodWheat portfolio of specialty wheat ingredients in other international markets.
Competition
 The markets for consumer goods are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. We compete with both large, established manufacturers, as well as small, innovative producers of pasta and beverage products. There are several companies working to improve genetics in crops, such as wheat, that may compete with the trait used in our GoodWheat products.
 In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:
 •Companies Selling Pasta Products: As we enter the direct to consumer and retail markets with our GoodWheat products, we believe we face significant competition from a variety of consumer-packaged goods companies. Our competitors in the pasta market range from companies like Banza and Ancient Harvest who offer high-nutrition pasta alternatives to large, traditional pasta producers including Barilla and De Cecco.
 •Specialty health and nutrition ingredient companies: In response to the growing consumer demand for healthier food alternatives, a number of agricultural and food-based companies are augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality food ingredients to market. Calyxt is an agriculture biotechnology company that has a similar strategy to ours to create healthier specialty food ingredients and agriculturally advantageous food crops.


•Coconut water: The beverage industry is competitive. Competitors in this market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, product shelf space, and e-commerce page rankings. Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and sell their products. Competitors in this space include Vita Coco, ZICO, C20 and Harmless Harvest.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 30 employees with 17 in management, operations, commercial production, accounting/finance, legal and administration. We believe our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.
Diversity and Inclusion
 At Arcadia, we recognize the immense benefits that a diverse team brings to our organization, including delivering better business outcomes. Our talented people leverage their diverse backgrounds and skills toward a common goal: meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same. This spirit of inclusive collaboration can be felt throughout our Company. Our commitment to diversity begins at the highest levels of our organization, as evidenced by the fact that 43% of our Board of Directors are women. From a management perspective, 63% of our CEO's direct reports are women, racially or ethnically diverse, which we believe sets the right tone and expectation for diversity and inclusion within the Company. More broadly, 59% of our employees are women.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Dallas, Texas with additional office space in Davis, California and additional facilities in American Falls, Idaho. We believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, if needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.
