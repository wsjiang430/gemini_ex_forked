DIGITAL DISPLAY PRODUCTS
 
The Company’s LED display systems include the latest features and functionality. The Company’s product line of high-performance state-of-the-art digital display products and controllers are used to show full-color video and messages in virtually any configuration and application. The products are used by sports arenas and stadiums; financial institutions, including brokerage firms, banks, energy companies, insurance companies and mutual fund companies; educational institutions; outdoor advertising companies; corporate and government communication centers; retail outlets; casinos, racetracks and other gaming establishments; airports, train stations, bus terminals and other transportation facilities; movie theatres; health maintenance organizations and in various other applications.  All sales and service, including fixed digit scoreboards, related to sports are sold through our wholly owned subsidiary, FairPlay Corporation, capitalizing on a well-recognized brand name that has been servicing this segment for over 85 years.
 
For its fixed digit scoreboards, the Company has an industry leading unibody design that allows for seamless appearance and facilitates field installation.
 
For its digital displays, the Company employs a modular engineering design strategy, allowing basic “building blocks” of modules to be easily combined and configured in order to meet the broad application requirements of the various industries it serves.  This approach ensures product flexibility, reliability, ease of service and reduced spare parts requirements.
 
The Company’s display product line is comprised of two distinct segments: the Digital product sales division and the Digital product lease and maintenance division.
 
Digital Product Sales Division:  The Digital product sales division is segmented into five categories: Out-of-Home, Sports, Transportation, Live Entertainment and Retail & Hospitality. 
 
Digital product Lease and Maintenance Division:  The Digital product lease and maintenance division leases and performs maintenance on digital products across all the sectors under agreement terms ranging from 30 days to 10 years.
 
Sales Order Backlog (excluding leases):  The amount of sales order backlog at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $6.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively.  The December 31, 2022 backlog is expected to be recognized as sales in 2023, although there can be no assurance thereof.  These amounts include only the sale of products; they do not include new lease orders or renewals of existing lease agreements that may be presently in-house.
 
ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company’s ability to compete and operate successfully depends on its capacity to anticipate and respond to the changing technological and product needs of its customers, among other factors.  For this reason, the Company continually develops enhancements to its existing product lines and examines and tests new display technologies.
 
The Company’s TLVisionTM line includes our latest LED Large Screen Systems that feature the most recent digital product technologies and capabilities, available in various pitch design. TLVisionTM consists of full-color video products that can be used in a multitude of applications.  These applications range from posting alphanumeric data to the displaying of full HD video.  The pixel pitches of the products range from 1.5mm for close distance viewing and up to 50mm for long-distance viewing.  The Company also continues to expand its line of scoreboard solutions using its TLVisionTM technology and improved hand-held, simple to operate remotes and wireless control devices.
 




As part of its ongoing development efforts, the Company seeks to package certain products for specific market segments and continually tracks emerging technologies that can enhance its products. Full color, live video and digital input technologies continue to be enhanced.
 
The Company maintains a staff responsible for product development and support.  The engineering, product enhancement and development efforts are supplemented by outside independent engineering consulting organizations, as required.
 
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
 
In North America, the Company markets its digital display products in the United States and Canada using a combination of distribution channels, including direct sales representatives and a network of independent dealers and distributors.  By working with software vendors and using the internet to expand the quality and quantity of multimedia content that can be delivered to our digital products, we offer customers relevant, timely information, content management software and display hardware in the form of turnkey display communications packages.
 
The Company employs a number of different marketing techniques to attract new customers, including direct marketing efforts by its sales force to known and potential users of information displays; internet marketing; advertising in industry publications; and exhibiting at domestic and international trade shows.

In 2022, one customer accounted for 13.3% of the Company’s total revenues. In 2021, no customers accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s total revenues.
 
MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONS
 
The Company’s production facilities are located in Hazelwood, Missouri, and Des Moines, Iowa.  The production facilities consist principally of the manufacturing, assembly and testing of digital product units and related components. The Company performs most subassembly and final assembly of its digital display products.
 
All product lines are design engineered by the Company and controlled throughout the manufacturing process.  The Company has the ability to produce very large sheet metal fabrications, cable assemblies and surface mount and through-hole designed assemblies.  Some of the subassembly and final assembly processes are outsourced.  The Company’s production of many of the subassemblies and final assemblies gives the Company the control opportunity needed for on-time delivery to its customers.
 
The Company has the ability to modify its product lines.  The Company’s displays are designed with flexibility in mind, enabling the Company to customize its displays to meet different applications with a minimum amount of lead-time.  The Company designs certain of its materials to match components furnished by suppliers.  If such suppliers are unable to provide the Company with those components, the Company would have to contract with other suppliers to obtain replacement sources.  Such replacement might result in engineering design changes, and delays in obtaining such replacement components.  The Company believes it maintains suitable inventory and has contracts providing for delivery of sufficient quantities of such components to meet its needs.  The Company also believes that there are presently other qualified vendors of these components.  Other than the LEDs and LED modules which are manufactured by foreign sources, the Company does not acquire significant amounts of components directly from foreign suppliers.  The Company’s products are third-party certified for compliance with applicable safety, electromagnetic emissions and susceptibility requirements worldwide.
 




SERVICE AND SUPPORT
 
The Company emphasizes the quality and reliability of its products and the ability of its field service personnel and third-party agents to provide timely and expert service to the Company’s equipment on lease and maintenance bases and other types of customer-owned equipment. The Company believes that the quality and timeliness of its on-site service personnel are essential components for the Company’s ongoing and future success.  The Company provides turnkey installation and support for the products it leases and sells in the United States and Canada.  The Company provides training to end-users and ongoing support to users who have questions regarding operating procedures, equipment problems or other issues.  The Company provides installation and service to those who purchase and lease equipment.  Additionally, the Company’s dealers and distributors offer support for the products they sell in the market segments they cover.
 
Personnel based in regional and satellite service locations throughout the United States provide high quality and timely on-site service for the installed equipment on lease and maintenance bases and other types of customer-owned equipment.  Purchasers or lessees of the Company’s larger products, such as financial exchanges, casinos and sports stadiums, often retain the Company to provide on-site service through the deployment of a service technician who is on-site daily for scheduled events.
 
The Company operates its National Technical Services and Repair Centers from its facility in Hazelwood, Missouri.  Equipment repairs are performed and service technicians are dispatched nationwide from our Hazelwood location.  The Company’s field service division is augmented by various service companies in the United States, Canada and overseas.  From time to time, the Company uses various third-party service agents to install, service and/or assist in the service of certain displays for reasons that include geographic area, size and height of displays.
 
COMPETITION
 
The Company’s availability of short and long-term leases to customers and its nationwide sales, service and installation capabilities are major competitive advantages in the digital product business. The Company believes that it is the largest supplier of large-scale stock, commodity, sports and race book gaming digital products in the United States, as well as one of the larger digital product and service organizations in the country.
 
The Company competes with a number of competitors, both larger and smaller than itself, with products based on different forms of technology.  There are several competitors whose current products utilize similar technology to the Company’s and who possess the resources necessary to develop competitive and more sophisticated products in the future.
