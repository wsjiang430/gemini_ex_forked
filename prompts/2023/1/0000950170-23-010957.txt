ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 Astra’s mission is to improve life on Earth from space by launching a new generation of space products and services. These products and services are enabled by new constellations of small satellites in Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”), which have rapidly become smaller, cheaper, and many times more numerous than traditional satellites. We believe that frequent, reliable, dedicated launches and space products enabled by scaled manufacturing are the keys to accelerating the growth of the space economy.
 Astra aims to develop and operate a mass-producible dedicated mobile orbital launch system. Our system consists of a small launch vehicle that can be transported inside standard shipping containers and mobile ground launch infrastructure that we designed to be rapidly deployed anywhere in the world we are licensed to operate and where our spaceports are located. This system is designed by Astra and manufactured in Astra’s vertically-integrated rocket factory in Alameda, California, which we have designed to manufacture and integrate the majority of the components. Our launch system requires a launch site with little more than a concrete pad and only six Astra employees on-site. Our system is designed to meet the needs of modern LEO satellite constellations, allowing precise and rapid placement of individual satellites into their required orbits. We believe this makes Astra’s system more responsive and affordable than other launch alternatives for the thousands of LEO satellites which commercial companies and governments plan to launch in the coming decade.
 We have made significant progress in the development of our launch capabilities to date. On November 20, 2021, we successfully launched launch vehicle LV0007 into orbit at an inclination of 86.0 degrees, an altitude of 500 km and velocity of 7.61 km/s, making Astra one of the fastest U.S. companies to have successfully demonstrated the orbital placement of a test payload. We commenced paid commercial launch services in 2022. To date, we have had three commercial launches and have delivered 23 satellites into low earth orbit.
 During the third quarter of 2022, we decided to focus on the development and production of the next version of our launch system, which we unveiled at our inaugural Spacetech Day on May 12, 2022. As a result, we have discontinued the production of launch vehicles supported by our previous launch system, Launch System 1, and commenced development of our new launch system, Launch System 2. We anticipate conducting our first test launch of Launch System 2 by the end of 2023 and commencing commercial launches beginning in 2024.
 In addition to Launch Services, we also offer Space Products to LEO operators. Currently, under our Space Products segment, we offer an industry leading spacecraft engine platform consisting of two in-space electric propulsion systems. In 2022, we began delivery of our Astra Spacecraft EnginesTM to our customers. Currently, our spacecraft engines have more than 600 on-orbit burns making it one of the most proven spacecraft engine products in the market.
 We believe that these two operating segments will create an integrated space services platform that will allow our customers to focus on innovative applications rather than investing in bespoke satellite development and separately contracting Launch Services. Further details of our current and expected future service offerings are provided below.
 •Launch Services — To provide rapid, global, and affordable Launch Services to satellite operators and governments. We have conducted launch operations from Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida. We plan to add additional launch sites in diverse locations based on our customers' inclination requirements and as we increase the frequency of launches.
 •Space Products — To design and provide space products based on the customers' needs for a successful satellite launch. Currently we offer two in space electric propulsion systems. Our offering consists of the design and delivery of a propulsion module comprised of a thruster, a power processing unit, a tank and a feed system.
 2022 Highlights and Recent Developments
 On February 10, 2022, we conducted a commercial orbital launch for National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) pursuant to which we were to deliver four CubeSats to low-earth orbit on our launch vehicle LV0008. After a nominal first stage flight, there were electrical and software issues prior to the upper stage launch which resulted in a failure of deployment, ending the mission. Through our investigation process, we identified and corrected the electrical and software issues which caused the failure. This was our first launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station as well as the first launch under the Federal Aviation Administration FAA new Part 450 launch license. Part 450 consolidates Parts 415, 417, 431 and 435 under a single licensing regime and is expected to make it easier for us to obtain regulatory approval from the FAA for future launches.
 On March 15, 2022, we conducted an orbital launch for three customers of Spaceflight, Inc. and confirmed our first delivery of customer payloads into lower Earth orbit. Launch vehicle LV0009 (aka Rocket 3) took flight from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska.


On May 12, 2022, we announced Launch System 2, which would enable an upgraded launch vehicle, termed Rocket 4, capable of delivering 600 kg to mid-inclination orbits over its product lifecycle.
 On June 12, 2022, we conducted a commercial orbital launch for the NASA from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, in which we were to deliver two cubesats to low-earth orbit on our launch vehicle LV0010 in the first of what was to be a series of three launches to deploy the TROPICS constellation. After a nominal first stage flight, there was an upper stage engine anomaly which led to early depletion of fuel and engine shutdown prior to reaching its intended orbit. We began a mishap investigation in partnership with the FAA to understand the causes of the mishap and determine corrective actions.
 On August 4, 2022, we announced that we had decided to discontinue Launch System 1, including the second and third planned TROPICS launches, and focus our Launch Services business on completing the development of Launch System 2, with an additional focus on reliability and scale.
On November 8, 2022, we announced 237 cumulative committed orders of the Astra Spacecraft EngineTM. We also announced that our spacecraft engine business had completed its second customer program.
 On December 6, 2022, we executed a long-term lease on our 179,070 sq-ft manufacturing rocket facility in Alameda.
 On December 20, 2022, we announced that our Space Products business shipped our first multi-string Astra Spacecraft EngineTM integrated propulsion system.
 On March 1, 2023, the FAA certified the mishap investigation into the LV0010 flight closed, and we released a summary of our findings. In particular, we found that the anomalous fuel consumption during the upper stage flight was due to a combustion chamber wall burn-through that occurred 18 seconds into upper stage flight. Flight data showed that the burn-through was precipitated by a substantial blockage of the fuel injector. The mechanics of combustion and regenerative cooling are complex and this failure did not have an immediately apparent root cause, so extensive testing and analysis was required to recreate the failure mode and to understand both how the injector blockage was created and how it led to a burn-through.
 Strategy Overview
 Since its inception, Astra has taken a long-term view on the growth of the commercial space industry. In 2022, we saw global launch rate increase by 27%, the number of satellites launched increased by 31%, and the overall space economy grew by 8% to $464 billion. This long-term focus has guided our strategy, product roadmaps and investments. Our strategy to be the leading provider of launch services and space products required long-term investments in our rocket and space products production facilities in 2022, which guided our decision to raise capital through our business combination in 2021. In 2022, we completed the build out of our new Rocket 4 and Astra Spacecraft EngineTM production lines, and invested in the people and equipment needed to increase the quality and reliability of our products and services.
 •Increase launch capability. Astra is one of five privately funded companies that has conducted successful orbital launches and successfully delivered satellites into Earth orbit, and we have accomplished this faster than any other privately funded US company. Based on the data and experience gathered from our successful and unsuccessful missions in 2022, by investing in mass-produced rockets, and automation of key manufacturing and launch operations processes, we plan to lead the market in lowest cost launch. We have designed our Launch System 2, with the expectation that it could service 80% of the addressable satellite market.
 •Scale Space Products production. We moved into our new 60,000 square feet Astra Spacecraft EngineTM production facility in Sunnyvale, California at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. With an expected annual capacity of almost 500 units, this facility is designed to service our customers’ current needs as well as future demand.
 Our ability to achieve these goals and objectives by our planned timelines are conditional upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully and timely develop our Launch System 2, manufacture launch vehicles and effectively market and sell our space products and services. Please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors that could affect our ability to achieve these goals and our results of operations.
 Customer Overview
 As of December 31, 2022, we have signed contracts for Launch Services. Our customers primarily include satellite operators, satellite manufacturers and government agencies. We expect to commence commercial launches with our new launch system in 2024.
 On March 30, 2023, we announced that we had 278 cumulative orders for the Astra Spacecraft EngineTM including new orders for 264 units since the closing of our acquisition of Apollo Fusion on July 1, 2021. We began fulfilling those orders in 2022. By the end of 2022, we had delivered on three customer programs.
 We expect a portion of our pipeline to continue to convert into new contracts for Launch Services and Space Products throughout 2023. We believe that our traction to date is driven by our value proposition and direct marketing to potential customers. We note that a portion of this pipeline may not convert if we do not achieve certain milestones or if we are unable to keep up with the demand for our products and services from a production and delivery perspective.


Sales and Marketing
 We plan to grow our customer base for both Launch Services and Space Products. Additionally, as we execute on Space Product deliveries and the first launch of Rocket 4, we expect existing customers to expand their contracts with us for Launch Services and Space Products.
Unit Economics of Our Business Models
 •Launch Services. Launch Services are fixed priced either on a dedicated or ride-share basis. We may offer certain customers bulk discounts, and other customers may elect to purchase add-on services which are priced separately. Costs for Launch Services are largely fixed in nature and include the cost to manufacture the launch vehicle, testing, logistics, and launch operations. The difference represents our unit margins.
 •Space Products. Space Products include design and delivery of a propulsion module which consists of a thruster, a power processing unit, tank and a feed system. Space products are priced considering the design and engineering requirements of the propulsion module. The propulsion module pricing is fixed, and we typically charge separately for engineering services related to customizing the propulsion module. Costs for space products are generally fixed for the manufacturing and testing of the propulsion module and variable to include the time spent on design and engineering requirements. The difference represents our unit margins.
Research and Development
 Research and development (“R&D”) is and will continue to be an important part of our business as we invest in improving our existing products and services, as well as potentially in developing new products or services. We make choices on where to invest resources into R&D based on our view of the market and how it will evolve, and by identifying those opportunities for new or improved products and services where we believe Astra is well positioned to be successful. We apply an iterative approach to product development, emphasizing testing and learning as quickly as possible through rapid iteration, co-located design, build, and test facilities, and frequent launches, which we believe is unique.
 Currently, our Launch Services business is investing in the R&D activities necessary to complete the design, build, and qualification of Launch System 2, which we expect will bring significantly more capability to the market as compared to the prior version of our Launch System.
Our space products business is more focused on scaling up of our new production facility, though some R&D activities will continue, to further improve the current products, develop and potentially introduce other versions of the Astra Spacecraft EngineTM, and potentially develop and introduce other space products to the marketplace.
 We have historically invested some resources in Research and Development activities to support a future Space Services business, and we may do so again in the future.
 General and Administrative
 We manufacture and assemble nearly all of our products in house, and as a result rely on a number of supplier partnerships for components and raw materials for the launch system and spacecraft engine. We obtain these components in accordance with internal quality and traceability policies to ensure that our products can meet our and our customers' rigorous reliability requirements. Our design team goes to great effort to ensure that our components and assemblies are designed with simple, short lead time and commodity-based supply chains whenever possible. We engage into long-term supplier contracts for those components that are critical to function or have a limited supply base in order to protect our ability to scale production. Astra has two manufacturing facilities and two test facilities, totaling over 300,000 square feet where engineering and manufacturing are co-located with their respective products. Each facility is maintained under a long-term lease and is designed with scaled operations in mind. Please refer to Item 2. Properties below for more details.
 Our headquarters is located in Alameda, CA and is where we conduct rocket and launcher assembly and tests, as well as machining and metal forming operations for all products. In 2022, Astra began work on its second factory in Sunnyvale, CA for spacecraft components that will first be utilized to produce Astra Spacecraft EnginesTM in 2023. Additionally, we maintain two primary launch spaceports with the unique ability to expand and bring up new spaceports with little infrastructure required.
Human Capital
 Our employees are the cornerstone to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had 359 employees, all of whom were full-time. Our workforce is primarily based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Prior to joining our company, many of our employees had prior experience working for a wide variety of highly reputed commercial aviation, aerospace, high-technology and world-recognized organizations.
 Our human capital management strategy includes identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our cash and equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of cash-based and stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.


Our management team is comprised of our chief executive officer and nine direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets, particularly our diversity, capability development and succession planning. Accordingly, we regularly review employee development and succession plans for each of our functions to identify and develop our pipeline of talent. Across our broader population, approximately 22% of full-time employees are women and 34% belong to historically underrepresented groups. As we build out the team, we are also investing in the infrastructure needed for continuous professional development, feedback, performance management, and other aspects of a healthy, growth-oriented and high-performing work culture.

 Regulatory
 Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”)
 In order to conduct a launch, we must obtain a commercial space transportation license from the FAA. On August 18, 2021, the FAA granted a commercial space transportation license to us, allowing us to conduct flights of our launch vehicle (Rocket v3.0) from Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska to deliver customer payloads to LEO. This license is effective for launches on Rocket v3.0 through March 9, 2026. In addition, on February 4, 2022, the FAA granted us the first commercial space transportation license under Part 450, allowing for flights of our launch vehicle (Rocket v3.3) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to deliver customer payloads into LEO. The Company plans to seek similar licenses prior to the launch of Rocket 4.
 If there is a mishap during a launch, the FAA will require us to open an investigation into the mishap and we will not be able to launch until the investigation is closed, or the FAA has made a favorable public safety determination. For example, the FAA has recently concluded its mishap investigation into our LV0010 flight.
 Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
 The regulations, policies, and guidance issued by the FCC apply to the radio frequencies utilized during operation of our launch vehicles. When we communicate with our launch vehicles using any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we are operating a space station to which FCC regulations apply. Operators of regulated space stations are required to hold and maintain compliance with proper licenses throughout the duration of any given mission.
 The FCC recently enacted a new set of licensing guidelines for small satellites and related systems that may apply to future Astra launch vehicles or satellites manufactured by Astra. As a result, we may face a transition in license types from Special Temporary Authorization (“STA”) to the small satellite licensing guidelines. Additionally, the FCC is currently considering additional rules which could change the operational, technical and financial requirements for commercial space operators subject to U.S. jurisdiction. If these, proposed rules become final, they could change system design, and we may incur additional financial costs in order to comply with or secure new Astra spectrum licensure.
 As a U.S. licensee, the regulations, policies, and guidance issued by the FCC apply to the operation of Astra’s future satellite constellation and satellite services. Radio frequency communications between Astra satellites, gateways and user terminals for operations within the U.S. market are regulated by the FCC, including both space stations (satellites) and earth stations (gateways and user terminals). Operators of regulated space stations and earth stations are required to hold and maintain compliance with proper licenses throughout the duration of operations. Additionally, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) defines international radio regulations, recommendations, and technical standards which all apply to Astra’s constellation and satellite services globally.
 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export Controls
 Our business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the ITAR and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S.
 The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime concerning the spaceflight business.
 Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software, and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance by foreign persons, related to and who support our spaceflight business. Under the ITAR, we must receive permission from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" — "We are subject to stringent U.S. export and import control laws and regulations."
 The inability to secure and maintain other necessary export authorizations could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully or to operate our spaceflight business as planned. For example, if we were unable to obtain or maintain our licenses to export certain spacecraft hardware, we would be effectively prohibited from launching our vehicles from certain non-U.S. locations, which would limit the number of launch providers we could use. In addition, if we were unable to obtain a Department of State Technical Assistance Agreement to export certain launch provider related services, we would experience difficulties or even be unable to perform integration activities necessary to safely our transfer vehicles to non-U.S. launch vehicles. In both cases, these restrictions could lead to higher

launch costs which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, if we were unable to secure effective export licensure to authorize the full scope of activity with a foreign partner or supplier, we may need to implement design changes to spacecraft or updates to our supplier chain, which may increase costs or result in delays in vehicle launch schedules.
 Failure to comply with export control laws and regulations could expose us to civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges, debarment from government contracts, or limitations on our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, any changes in export control regulations or U.S. government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement U.S. government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations.
 Environmental Law Compliance
 We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, greenhouse gases and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at or from the property which could result in operational disruptions. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions.
