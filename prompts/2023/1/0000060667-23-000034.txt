General Information
Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Lowe’s) is a Fortune® 50 company and the world’s second largest home improvement retailer. As of February 3, 2023, Lowe’s operated 1,738 home improvement stores in the United States, representing approximately 195 million square feet of retail selling space. On February 3, 2023, Lowe’s completed the sale of its Canadian retail business, which operated 232 stores in Canada, as well as serviced 210 dealer-owned stores. The Canadian retail business included a number of complementary formats under the banners of RONA, Lowe’s Canada, Réno-Dépôt, and Dick’s Lumber. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report for information on this divestiture.
Lowe’s was founded in 1921 with the opening of its first hardware store in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The Company was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been publicly held since 1961. The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol “LOW”.
For additional information about the Company’s performance and financial condition, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report. 
Our Strategy
Lowe’s is an omnichannel retailer whose core priorities are to provide an excellent customer experience, create a great place to work for our associates, and improve our communities, which we believe will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. In 2020, we implemented our Total Home strategy, which reflects our commitment to provide a full complement of products and services for professional customers (Pro customers) and consumers alike, enabling a Total Home solution for every project across the home. Our Total Home strategy has the following five pillars:

Drive Pro penetration | Accelerateonline business | Expandinstallationservices | Drivelocalization | Elevateassortment

We continue to transform our Pro offerings to drive Pro penetration by expanding our Pro brands and product assortments, resetting the footprint of our stores to better serve Pro customers, and introducing our new MVPs Pro Rewards & Partnership ProgramTM this year, which further enhances our relationship with our Pro customers. We are investing in our omnichannel retail capabilities to expand our online business. We are increasing visibility to our installation services through improved signage throughout our stores and continuing to improve the customer experience for our services, which are provided by our network of independent installers or outsourced to our third-party model that sells, furnishes, and installs more complex projects. Our expanding localization efforts better serve the product needs of the unique communities across the country. Finally, we continue to elevate our product assortment to provide the right products at the right price to meet our customers’ needs. 
Our Customers and Market
The home improvement market in which we operate is highly fragmented, serving Pro customers, individual homeowners, and renters completing a wide array of projects that vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of three broad categories: tradespeople, repair and remodelers, and property managers. The U.S. market is our predominant market, accounting for approximately 95% of consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023. As of February 3, 2023, we completed the sale of our Canadian retail business and no longer operate in the Canada market, which accounted for approximately 5% of consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023. 
There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe’s offers.  Key indicators we monitor include home price appreciation, age of the housing stock, real disposable personal income, and housing turnover.  We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth, notably strong millennial household formation, consumer mobility, and the widespread adoption of remote work.
Our Competition
The home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape that continues to evolve.  Lowe’s competes with national and regional home improvement warehouse chains and lumber yards in most of the markets we serve.  We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical, home supply retailers, paint stores, lumber yards and garden centers, as well as maintenance and repair organizations.  In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, home goods specialty stores, warehouse clubs, online retailers, other specialty retailers, providers of equipment and tool rental, service providers that install home improvement products, and wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, renters, business, and the government.  
Location of stores, product assortment, product pricing, and customer service continue to be key competitive factors in our industry, while the evolution of technology and customer expectations also underscores the importance of omnichannel capabilities as a competitive factor.  To ensure ongoing competitiveness, Lowe’s focuses on delivering the right home improvement products, with the best service and value, across every channel and community we serve.  See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report.
Our Omnichannel Capabilities
We are committed to meeting customer demand to shop however, whenever, and wherever they choose. Our omnichannel capabilities allow our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store at the customer service desk, curbside, or from touchless lockers, or have their purchase delivered to their home or business. In addition, flexible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our leverage of our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we continue to introduce.
In-Store
Our 1,738 Lowe’s-branded home improvement stores in the United States are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space.  Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on localization, along with a dedicated team of knowledgeable and friendly front-line associates available to assist our customers. We continue to develop and implement productivity tools to enhance the efficiency of our sales associates and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes.  Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with Internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. 
Online
Through our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, product information, customer ratings and reviews, buying guides, how-to videos, and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store, curbside pick-up, truck delivery, and parcel shipment to their homes or businesses. We also offer new virtual design services for paints, blinds, and flooring for our customers. 
On-Site
We have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects.  Our Pro sales managers meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage nearby stores and our distribution network to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources.  In addition, our In-Home Sales program is available in the majority of our stores to discuss various exterior projects such as windows, doors, roofing, siding, and deck projects, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. 
Contact Centers
Lowe’s operates contact centers in a virtual workplace. These contact centers help Lowe’s enable an omnichannel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, assist with order management, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, and answer general customer questions via phone, mail, e-mail, live chat, and social media.
Our Products
Product Selection
To meet customers’ varying needs, we offer a complete line of products for construction, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating.  We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Appliances, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, Lawn & Garden, Lumber, Kitchens & Bath, Tools, Paint, Millwork, Hardware, Flooring, Rough Plumbing, Building Materials, Décor, and Electrical.  A typical Lowe’s-branded home improvement store stocks approximately 40,000 items, with over two million additional items available through our online selling channels. Our product assortments offered in-store are tailored to meet the needs of the local market. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years. 
We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of high-value private brands.  In fiscal 2022, we extended our STAINMASTER® brand to include additional flooring categories outside of carpet like laminate, vinyl, and tile. At the end of the fiscal year, we introduced STAINMASTER® paint as our first private paint brand. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost-effective manner.
Supply Chain
We source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.
To efficiently serve our stores and meet our customers’ expectations for fast fulfillment and delivery, we own and operate more than 100 supply chain facilities in our network. These facilities include regional distribution centers (RDCs), flatbed distribution centers (FDCs), import distribution centers (IDCs), bulk distribution centers (BDCs), and cross-dock terminals (XDTs). We also operate standalone fulfillment centers, which along with many of our stores, ship product directly to our customers. In addition, we are establishing a Pro fulfillment network across the country which will leverage a combination of our existing supply chain as well as new facilities, including our first Pro fulfillment center that opened this year. Each one of these distribution nodes plays a critical role in our Total Home strategy, and collectively, enable our products to get to their destination as efficiently as possible.
The FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. On average, each RDC and FDC serves approximately 115 stores. Our Pro fulfillment network stocks deeper quantities of our top Pro assortments and has expanded capabilities to handle large orders on multiple flat beds. Our IDCs were expanded to create more capacity to hold import product at the coast, which improves our network’s agility to move inventory where and when it is needed. Our BDCs handle appliances and other big and bulky product, and our XDTs fulfill final mile box truck deliveries of these products. 
Our supply chain supports every pillar of our Total Home strategy, and as such, we continue to invest and transform our network to unlock our omnichannel capabilities while keeping our organization’s sustainability goals top of mind. As part of the continued rollout of our market-based delivery model, we expanded to additional geographic areas and enhanced our distribution capacity for big and bulky product. To date, we have 11 geographic areas converted to our market-based delivery model.
We have also been focused on improving the speed of our delivery capabilities for our customers. As of fiscal year 2022, most parcel-eligible items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates. Also, the nationwide expansion of our gig networks provides same-day delivery of certain products from our stores. Customer needs and buying patterns are constantly changing, and our supply chain will continue to evolve to meet their needs. We are building an omnichannel supply chain that operates with greater network capacity, better flow management and optimization. 
Our Services
Installed Sales
We offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Flooring, Kitchens & Bath, Millwork, Appliances, and Lumber accounting for the majority of installed sales.  Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed.  Installed sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2022.
Lowe’s Protection Plans and Repair Services
We offer extended protection plans for certain products within the Appliances, Kitchens & Bath, Décor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances the coverage offered by the manufacturer’s warranty and provide additional benefits and repair services that extend beyond the manufacturer’s warranty. 
Seasonality and Working Capital
The retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal.  Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June, and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December, and January).  Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes.  We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report.
Intellectual Property
The name “Lowe’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and logo and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary owns and maintains various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and trade names, including private brand product names, such as, “Kobalt”, “STAINMASTER” and “allen+roth.” This subsidiary also maintains various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.
Human Capital
When it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Lowe’s strives to be the employer of choice in retail. At Lowe’s we are committed to creating valuable career opportunities for our associates, supporting them and the communities where they live, and cultivating a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas. We are focused on ensuring our associates see Lowe’s as a “Home to Possibility” with good jobs, a sense of belonging, and a promising future. 
As a testament to our commitments, in 2022 we received more than 15 notable employer of choice awards including being named: a Disability:IN National Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, a Forbes America’s Best Large Employers, a Best of the Best 2022 Top Employer by Black EOE Journal, HISPANIC Network Magazine, and Professional Woman’s Magazine, and a Best Corporation for Veteran’s Business Enterprises of the Year.
Our People
As of February 3, 2023, Lowe’s employed approximately 182,000 full-time associates and 125,000 part-time associates, primarily in the United States and India. During the spring season, we temporarily expand our workforce by hiring associates in part-time and full-time positions to meet the elevated levels of demand. 
At Lowe’s, we continue to listen carefully to our associates, most notably through our annual engagement survey. In 2022, more than 90% of our associates participated in our survey and that data is used to improve our associate experience.
Creating Good Jobs
We have a strong track record of investing in our workforce by offering locally competitive salaries and wages. Since 2018, we have invested more than $3 billion in incremental wages and share-based compensation for our front-line associates, which included creating many new roles for our associates to grow into, inclusive of 1,600 new assistant manager positions and 10,000 department supervisor positions. 
This fiscal year, we implemented $170 million in annual wage increases, effective December 2022, in addition to the profit-sharing and discretionary bonuses we awarded throughout the year. In addition, we offer an array of health, welfare, and financial benefits to our full-time and part-time associates, including health care and insurance benefits, retirement plans, an employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, and leave programs, among many others. We have implemented workforce management tools that enable us to offer various scheduling options to our full-time associates to foster an improved experience in balancing their work and life responsibilities. This includes such options for a shortened workweek, consistent shifts, or consecutive days off. 
Our focus on the associate experience begins at initial application. The implementation of improved technology in the hiring process has simplified the experience for those looking to join Lowe’s and helped to drive the experience overall. Once hired, associates now experience an improved onboarding to help them quickly learn the knowledge and skills required to be successful in their new roles. This onboarding includes assigning dedicated mentors to help new hires through the learning process. 
Providing a safe environment for both working and shopping is our highest priority at Lowe’s. We strive to maintain a culture of safety, which begins with our leaders modeling the behaviors we want our associates to adopt. We embed safety into associate onboarding, developmental e-learning and on-the-job training.
Sense of Belonging
We believe that, by building diverse and inclusive teams, we drive better ideas, positive business results, and improve service through a deeper connection with our customers. We continue to execute on our multi-year program to integrate diversity and inclusion initiatives into our corporate strategy across three areas: talent, culture, and business. We continue to strive to attract diverse talent for leadership positions across our company. In 2022, we held our tenth annual Women’s Leadership Summit, focused on developing women leaders across our corporate and field locations. In our efforts to foster an inclusive culture, we have eight business resource groups that are sponsored by our executive team. These groups provide our associates with opportunities to collaborate, network, and learn together, and offer additional spaces where associates feel heard and can engage with other colleagues across the organization. We also recognize the importance of strengthening our bonds with the diverse communities we serve. We are one of the founding partners of the OneTen coalition, which committed to hiring one million Black Americans in the next ten years. 
Promising Future
We are committed to securing top talent and providing ongoing training and other developmental opportunities to facilitate meaningful careers at Lowe’s. We offer a variety of role-specific leadership and development programs that build and reinforce functional-technical/professional skills, business acumen, and leadership skills to prepare high-performing leaders for their next role. Our focus on leadership development enables us to grow talent internally and has resulted in more than 80% of leadership positions being filled internally in the last year. Additionally, nearly 90% of our store leaders have advanced to their current positions from hourly roles.
This year we expanded Lowe's University offerings to include the District Manager and Store Manager immersive week-long leadership experience programs, delivered from the Lowe’s University training center; the virtual-delivered store department supervisor fundamentals series; the virtual-delivered field supply chain leadership director, manager, and supervisor experience programs; and the certification programs for store and technology associates that further develop their skills and knowledge base. 
Additionally, through Lowe’s Track to the Trades program, we offer all Lowe’s associates the opportunity to enroll in programs to complete apprentice certifications in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, appliance repair, or multi-family maintenance. The program also connects them with Pros to help them start a career in their area of interest. The Track to the Trades program demonstrates Lowe’s commitment to our industry and the communities we serve. This combined with our tuition-free education program are further examples of how we are investing in the future of our associates.
Corporate Responsibility
We take our role as a Fortune® 50 retailer seriously by managing our business responsibly and focusing on serving our associates and the communities where we live and work. We strive to integrate sustainability objectives into our business, particularly by focusing on the three pillars of our sustainability strategy: our people and communities, product sustainability, and reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, which we believe will help drive long-term shareholder value. 

In addition to oversight by the full Board of Directors, the Board has also delegated primary responsibility for more frequent and in-depth oversight of Lowe’s sustainability strategies and initiatives and reviewing our position on significant environmental and social issues to the sustainability committee of the Board of Directors. In fiscal 2022, for the fourth consecutive year, Lowe’s was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index based on our ESG practices. 
Investing in our Communities
We understand the important role Lowe’s plays in providing products, services, and support to our communities. Through our community engagement initiatives and our continued partnerships with nonprofits across the nation, we are mending neighborhoods, revitalizing community spaces, supporting communities when disaster strikes, and preparing the next generation of skilled tradespeople to continue those efforts for years to come. We carry out these initiatives with a special focus on our nation’s veterans and active military community, first-responders, and under-resourced communities. 
In fiscal 2022, Lowe's announced a five-year, $100 million investment in the communities we serve through a new program called Lowe's Hometowns. Each year from 2022 through 2026, Lowe's Hometowns will complete nearly 1,800 community impact projects, including 100 signature projects chosen from consumer nominations, and nearly 1,700 projects selected through Lowe's stores, supply chain facilities, and store support centers across the country. Through this effort, Lowe’s is helping restore and revitalize spaces that serve as the hubs and heartbeats of communities, including neighborhood services, parks, and community centers. 
In addition, throughout the year we partnered with dozens of nonprofit organizations to identify and respond to critical needs in local communities, including Building Homes for Heroes, Rebuilding Together, and Local Initiatives Support Corporation. Lowe’s also continues to support our communities as they respond to and recover from natural disasters by providing tools and supplies, access to tool rental trailers, and volunteering with clean-up efforts.
In fiscal 2022, our associates across the U.S. contributed nearly 170,000 volunteer hours through Lowe’s-sponsored community engagement activities as well as in their personal time. In addition, through funding from our own associate donations and Company matching, we are able to support associates in times of significant, unforeseen financial hardship through the Lowe’s Employee Relief Fund. 
Product Sustainability
We are committed to promoting sustainable practices throughout our supply chain and providing customers with eco-friendly, high quality, and safe products. Our products undergo a thorough selection process, beginning with our sourcing decisions. Through collaboration and established management systems, we monitor our suppliers’ practices to secure high-quality products from suppliers who support worker rights and protect the environment. Lowe’s human rights policy supports the fundamental principles of human rights, as defined by the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” We continue to hold all suppliers to our rigorous standards through our human rights policy, our conflict minerals policy, and our Vendor Code of Conduct which includes enhanced environmental standards for all suppliers. In addition, we have a wood sourcing policy that specifies that all wood products sold in our stores originate from well-managed, non-endangered forests.

As part of our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our products, we continue to increase our offering of independently certified products that have validated environmental claims, reduce the usage of natural resources, and help customers decrease energy and water consumption. We work with local and regional utilities to offer customers assorted rebates for a variety of environmentally efficient products including ENERGY STAR® and WaterSense®. 
Reducing our Environmental Footprint
We are committed to mitigating climate change by reducing the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain through reducing carbon emissions with investments in energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, environmentally friendly transportation practices, and innovative water and waste management systems. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In December 2022, we announced our goal to reach net-zero emissions across the Company’s scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in accordance with guidelines from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the global body enabling businesses to set emissions reduction targets in line with climate science. To meet interim SBTi targets, Lowe’s has also committed to decreasing its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 40% and reducing scope 3 emissions by 22.5% below 2021 levels by 2030.
To reach these targets, Lowe’s will focus on increasing operational efficiency and working to reduce emissions across Lowe's entire value chain. We are making further investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy within our operations, while exploring emerging technologies to reduce emissions associated with our vehicle fleet and facilities. Over the past three years, we have spent nearly $500 million across multiple projects including indoor LED lighting upgrades, replacing stores’ aging HVAC units with high efficiency models, installing and updating building management systems, and installing pallet grinders. Lowe’s is also focused on partnering with suppliers to help reduce upstream emissions. We are working closely with suppliers to increase their operational efficiency and reduce their emissions through the use of renewable energy and low-carbon innovations.
Continuing to procure renewable energy is one way Lowe’s is working to reduce our emissions footprint. In 2020, we secured our first renewable power purchase agreement, the Mesquite Star wind farm in Texas, now in its third year of operation. That same year, we partnered with Swift Current Energy to source additional renewable energy from the Black Diamond Solar Project in Illinois, which is expected to become operational in the next few years. We continue to establish a pipeline of other offsite renewable projects planned to become active over several years. Lowe’s continues to be a member of the Clean Energy Buyers Association to evaluate and explore new opportunities and technologies across renewable energy markets (e.g., community solar, power purchase agreements), as well as implementing on-site solar generation in multiple states.
We are dedicated to promoting sustainable practices in the transportation industry, and we collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions by managing and reducing fuel usage by creating incentives for freight contractors to improve efficiency. We are an EPA SmartWay program partner and aim for 100% SmartWay certification for our transportation providers. This program provides access to comprehensive data and oversight of Scope 3 emissions associated with our U.S. transportation footprint. 
Waste
We partner with suppliers to improve recycling and waste diversion, develop regional management processes, measure waste streams, and conduct waste audits. At a local level, store waste, including cardboard, broken appliances, and wood pallets, is recycled through national and regional partners, and we provide in-store recycling and reuse centers for our customers to bring in plastic planter pots, compact fluorescent lamp bulbs, plastic bags, and rechargeable batteries. In our second year collaborating with How2Recycle, we continue to educate customers and encourage proper recycling of our product packaging. As technology and innovative practices improve, we will continue to explore opportunities to participate in the circular economy. 
Water
While our water consumption is modest compared with other industries, we continue to focus on reducing water consumption within our operations. We use smart irrigation controllers for efficient watering at most stores and have been exploring other water-efficient technologies to increase water savings in our stores and garden centers. Additionally, we use leak detection technology to catch leaks as they occur to prevent unnecessary water use. We also have protocols in place to manage the disposal of chemicals to prevent release into waterways of the communities we serve. 
Corporate Responsibility Reporting
Lowe’s participates in the CDP’s climate change, forests, and water security questionnaires to benchmark and quantify our environmental practices, provide transparency on our progress, and assist in the reduction of our contributions to climate change. Lowe’s continues to externally verify our scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions and water usage data to increase confidence in our reporting. Additionally, we align our sustainability reporting with the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board, the Global Reporting Initiative, and the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. We publish our annual Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report to assess our climate-related risks and opportunities and better understand the potential impacts on our value chain.
