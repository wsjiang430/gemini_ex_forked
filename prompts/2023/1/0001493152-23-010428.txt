Item 1. Business.
Organization
 
Indoor Harvest Corp (the “Company”) is a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Our principal executive office was located at 7401 W. Slaughter Lane #5078, Austin, Texas 78739 for the year ended 2019. From inception until about August 4, 2017, in summary, the Company pursued a business of certain engineering, procurement and construction related services as to the indoor and vertical farming industry and production platforms, mechanical systems and custom designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) and Building Integrated Agriculture (“BIA”), for two unique industries, produce and cannabis.
 
In mid-2016, the Company began efforts to separate its produce and cannabis related pursuits due to ongoing feedback from both clients and potential institutional investors. It was determined that the Company’s involvement in the cannabis industry was creating conflicts for clients and potential institutional investors wishing to work with the Company from the produce industry due to the public perception and political issues surrounding the cannabis industry. By late-2016, the Company had decided to cease actively selling its products and services to the vertical farming industry and to focus on utilizing the Company’s developed technology and methods for the cannabis industry.
 
On August 3, 2017, we formed Alamo Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned Texas limited liability company (“Alamo Acquisition Sub”). On August 4, 2017, the Company ceased actively supporting business development of vertical farms for produce production and consummated a business acquisition (the “Alamo Acquisition”) pursuant to which Alamo Acquisition Sub acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Alamo CBD, LLC (“Alamo CBD”), a Texas limited liability company. Upon closing of the Alamo Acquisition, the membership interests of Alamo CBD were exchanged for 7,584,008 shares of Indoor Harvest’s common stock, the parent company of Alamo Acquisition Sub. Alamo CBD continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist.
 
On August 14, 2019, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, IHC Consulting, Inc. (“IHC”), in the State of New York of the United States of America. IHC Consulting will provide consulting and other services to the Company and others on a contracted basis.
 
Description of Business
 
Indoor Harvest, through its brand name Indoor Harvest®, was focused on leveraging technology and planning on Vertical Farming, Building Integrated Agriculture, Controlled Environment Agriculture and Aeroponic Cultivation technology with other synergistic enterprises in the Cannabis industry prior to 2020..
 
The 2022 business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors.
 
Our operational expenditures will be focused on our plans to create shareholder value through an M&A and strategic partnership strategy, while managing the necessary costs related to being a fully reporting company with the SEC.
 
COVID-19
 
A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019, and subsequently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. The Company has instituted some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures intended to help ensure the well-being of its managers and minimize business disruption. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations and financial position at September30, 2020. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on financial results and business operations of the Company, including the timing and ability of the Company to develop its business plan.

Industry and Regulatory Overview
 
The United States federal government regulates drugs through the CSA (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as highly addictive and having no medical value. The United States Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) has not approved the sale of cannabis for any medical application. Doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical use under federal law, however, they can recommend its use under the First Amendment. In 2010, the United States Veterans Affairs Department clarified that veterans using medicinal cannabis will not be denied services or other medications that are denied to those using illegal drugs.
 
State legalization efforts conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) providing that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing cannabis-related use, and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems, the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics laws.
 
On January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended the Cole Memo and replaced it with a new Memorandum titled with the subject “Marijuana Enforcement” from Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo.
 
In November 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned and left the DOJ. As a nominee, Attorney General William Barr testified before the U.S. Senate and wrote to Congress that, as Attorney General, he would not seek to prosecute cannabis companies that relied on the Cole Memo and are complying with state law.
 
As of April 25, 2019, 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through de-criminalization. Within this list of jurisdictions, voters in the States of Alaska, California, Colorado, D.C., Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use.
 
The Company continues to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress’ positions on federal law and cannabis policy. As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell in the U.S. and directly violating federal law if we should begin producing cannabis under State law. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis.
 
As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited to, a claim of aiding and abetting another’s criminal activities or directly violating the CSA. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who “commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal” (18 U.S.C. §2(a).) Enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in the Company being unable to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture which could lead to an entire loss of any investment in the Company. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 
Although the Company, from 2020 and going forward, intends to focus on plant-based opportunities, hemp businesses, and other ancillary industry companies, changes in the regulatory and legal environment could impact banking, financial, and other business services crucial to the operations of the business.
 
Nothing herein is a legal opinion or a complete or up to date statement on laws, regulations, or policies, especially given the shifting legal and regulatory landscape.
 
Changes in Business Operations
 
2022 was a continuation of our 2020 restructuring, reorganizing, and repositioning of the business. The Company believes it is positioned to start executing its business strategy and leveraging the public company to create shareholder value. The recent long-term commitments of the new management team coupled with a robust business network to support our business initiatives have laid the foundation for the future. We will be working on branding and continuing to build our team in 2022, once we have our new plans funded.
 
The current business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors.
 
On February 14, 2022, the Company announced a non-binding letter of intent with Electrum Partners, LLC (EP) to acquire certain assets of EP for an aggregate payment at closing and of a purchase price that will be mutually agreed by the parties based on an independent valuation of the purchased assets.
 
On March 1, 2023, the Company announced an Asset Purchase agreement to acquire certain business assets, including the rights to further develop business opportunities in various stages of due diligence from EP.
 
The Company is subject to risks, no assurance exists of ability to raise sufficient capital on good terms or our ability to become profitable.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company relies on a strategy of a combination of patent law, trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. This does not mean these efforts are up to date or fully effective. The following summarizes certain filings. The Company is currently studying the legal aspects of these, including recent and past communications from counsel and the patent office, and makes no promise or representation as to this information which is subject to correction and update.
 
The Company’s primary trademark is “Indoor Harvest.” This trademark was registered (Registration Number 4,795,471) in the United States on August 18, 2015.
 
The Company filed a patent application (Serial Number 14/120,275) with the United States patent office related to an invention titled: “modular aeroponic system and related methods.” The inventor is Chad Sykes, who assigned the patent application to the Company.
 
We will research the status of our filings and restructure or update as needed this year.
 
Plan of Expanded Operations
 
The current business strategy is to position the Company as an integrated consolidation platform for plant-based industry companies focused on hemp, other hemp-related products, CBD, and other plant-based companies with the potential to be part of a bigger opportunity while sharing intellectual capital, technology, expanded business networks, along with access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors.

As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell, lease and license in the U.S. to grow cannabis. Additionally, we would be violating federal law should we begin to manufacture and dispense cannabis under the TCUP. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis. As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited, to a claim of aiding and abetting another’s criminal activities or directly violating federal law by manufacturing or distributing cannabis. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who “commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.” However, we do not believe that our plans to license and sell technology as described herein violates federal law and we believe that we would prevail if any such action were brought against us although there can be no assurance of this.
 
Cannabis is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in such states that have legalized the use of cannabis, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan, notably with respect to our plans for cannabis cultivation, production and research. In addition, our assets, including real property, cash, equipment and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because cannabis is still illegal at the federal level should we begin to manufacture and distribute cannabis under the TCUP.
 
In February 2017, the Trump administration made announcements that there could be “greater enforcement” of federal laws regarding cannabis. To this end, on January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended certain Obama era protections set forth previously in the Cole Memo, as such term is defined above, which was replaced with a new Memorandum titled with the subject “Marijuana Enforcement” from Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo. Any such enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In November 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned and left the DOJ. As a nominee, Attorney General William Barr testified before the U.S. Senate and wrote to Congress that, as Attorney General, he would not seek to prosecute cannabis companies that relied on the Cole Memo and are complying with state law. The Company plans to continue to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress’ positions on federal law and cannabis policy.
 
The regulatory environment on a Federal, State, and Local level remains opaque and ever changing. This aspect of business risk is in flux and our disclosure should not be deemed a legal opinion or interpreted as fully addressing the myriad regulatory challenges inherent in the industry.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
