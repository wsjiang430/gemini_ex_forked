Item 1. Business 
Overview 
Our mission is to help humanity thrive by enabling the world’s teams to work together effortlessly. 
Asana is a work management platform that helps organizations orchestrate work, from daily tasks to cross-functional strategic initiatives. Over 139,000 paying customers use Asana to manage everything from product launches to marketing campaigns to organization-wide goal setting. Our platform adds structure to unstructured work, creating clarity, transparency, and accountability to everyone within an organization—individuals, team leads, and executives—so they understand exactly who is doing what, by when. 
History 
We started Asana because our co-founders experienced firsthand the growing problem of work about work. While at Facebook, they saw the coordination challenges the company faced as it scaled. Instead of spending time on work that generated results, they were spending time in status meetings and long email threads trying to figure out who was responsible for what. They recognized the pain of work about work was universal to organizations that need to coordinate their work effectively to achieve their objectives. Yet there were no products in the market that adequately addressed this pain. As a result of that frustration, they were inspired to create Asana to solve this problem for the world’s teams. 
Since our inception, over 42 million users have registered on Asana and millions of teams in virtually every country around the world have used Asana. With Asana, users experience higher productivity and engagement, which has led to rapid adoption across teams, departments, and organizations. As of January 31, 2023, we had over 2.5 million paid users. 
Teams Spend Too Much Time on Work About Work 
Work continues to get harder to manage as organizations try to move faster to accomplish ambitious goals and respond to changing market demands. According to Asana’s most recent Anatomy of Work Index report, 58% of knowledge workers’ time is spent on work about work. Most important work requires coordination across teams and geographies, for example, a product launch with product, marketing and sales all working together. Without a system of record, organizations move slowly, miss deadlines, and fail to live up to their full potential. At work, people face an overwhelming volume of communications from email and messaging applications, many of which are asking for status updates. These messages often provide limited clarity around what steps need to be taken, and by when, and limited accountability around who owns the action. As a result, requests go unanswered, and employees spend more time searching and responding to messages in an attempt to provide clarity and accountability to their teams. These emails and messages only give teams momentary clarity about specific deliverables or actions, and as such they do not provide a holistic, persistent, and referenceable plan of record that can be easily or quickly accessed, shared, and updated. 
To minimize work about work, reduce chaos, and give individuals time back to focus on the work that matters, teams need a purpose-built solution for coordination. Despite the growth in collaboration technology such as content tools and messaging apps, there has been little innovation in work management—systems that help teams to plan, manage, and execute their work.
How Asana Helps Organizations 
The problem we aim to solve is that teams are organized functionally but work gets done cross-functionally. Asana is a system of record and leading platform for cross-functional work. We provide an always up-to-date record of who is doing what by when across teams. The technology that makes this possible is the Asana Work Graph, our 
Table of Contents

proprietary data model built by the same people who created the social graph. The Asana Work Graph captures and associates: 
•units of work—tasks, projects, milestones, portfolios, and goals; 
•the people responsible for executing those units of work; 
•the processes in which work gets done—rules, workflows, and templates; 
•information about that work—files, comments, status, messages, and metadata; and 
•relationships across and within this data. 
The Asana Work Graph is the technology that makes it possible for every individual and team to view their work in a way that is personally relevant to them, while maintaining a single, always-up-to-date, record of every goal, project, task, document, etc. 
It is one of our biggest differentiators and the reason we support deployments with more than 150,000 users and win large cross-functional deals. 
Asana is flexible and applicable to virtually any use case across departments and organizations of all sizes. We designed our platform to be easy to use and intuitive to all users, regardless of role or technical proficiency. Users can start a project within minutes and onboard team members seamlessly without external support. We allow users to work the way they want with the interface that is right for them, using tasks, lists, calendars, boards, timelines, reporting dashboards, and Workload. 
Our Business Model 
Our hybrid product-led and direct sales model allows us to reach teams everywhere and then rapidly expand the use of our platform within their organizations. A majority of our paying customers initially adopt our platform through product-led channels, like signing up on our website, and free trials. Once adopted, customers can expand through product-led channels or with the assistance of our direct sales team, which is focused on promoting new use cases of Asana and ensuring customers are well supported to grow with Asana. As customers realize the productivity benefits we provide, our platform often becomes critical to managing their work and achieving their objectives, which drives further adoption and expansion opportunities. This is evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate, which generally increases with greater organizational spend. As of January 31, 2023, our dollar-based net retention rate within organizations spending $5,000 or more with us on an annualized basis was over 120%, consisting of 19,432 customers. Our dollar-based net retention rate within organizations spending $100,000 or more with us on an annualized basis was over 135%, consisting of 506 customers.
Our Company Culture 
We believe that our company culture enables us to achieve our mission and is a core driver of our business success. We endeavor to make product, business, and people decisions that allow us to carry out our mission while staying true to our values. We are a mission-driven organization first and have designed our values, along with our programs and processes, to help us maximize the potential of every individual in our company. Our values and processes also give us credibility when we share best practices for teamwork in the market and allow us to build those practices into our solution. 
Industry Background 
Organizations must be coordinated and move quickly to be successful 
Organizations today must navigate work that is increasingly cross-functional, matrixed, and distributed, while also moving quickly to meet the objectives of their organizations. With product lifecycles now shorter than ever, organizations cannot afford to be slowed down by inefficient processes. Individuals and teams need to be 
Table of Contents

empowered to make autonomous decisions aligned with organizational goals to ensure business agility in rapidly changing markets. 
Communication overload hurts productivity 
Businesses have adopted a number of applications to improve communication such as Skype, WeChat, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, and Slack, among others. While these applications help teams communicate, they were not designed to provide a system of record to track and coordinate units of work or to set up processes for rapid execution. The average knowledge worker spends the majority — 58% — of their day on work coordination rather than skilled, strategic work. People have become prisoners to email and messaging applications, using their inboxes as makeshift to-do lists. 
Organizations spend more time coordinating work than actually doing work 
Productivity gains can occur when individuals and teams have the opportunity to focus uninterrupted. However, employees spend less than half of their time during the day on the work that is critical to generating results. According to a survey conducted by McKinsey Global Institute of a broad set of knowledge workers: 
•28% of time is spent answering email; 
•19% of time is spent gathering information; and 
•14% of time is spent on internal communication. 
Organizations need more effective tools to orchestrate work 
The primary methods for managing work today—across any department, any sized team, and any project—consist of a combination of spreadsheets and email, in addition to handwritten notes, calls, and meetings. Over time, communication tools (like email and messaging) and content applications (such as file sharing and storage services) have been repurposed for coordinating work because they are familiar and accessible. Unfortunately, most software products do not use a graph architecture like Asana and major social networks. They use a container model which is similar to a spreadsheet. 
Container models mean that data needs to be organized by team or department or project. And information cannot simultaneously live in different places. Individuals either have to adopt the exact same format uniformly, or they create copies which means teams and companies no longer have a single unified record of who is doing what by when. 
Clarity drives employee engagement that improves business results 
Employee engagement—the extent to which employees are invested in their job and contribute the effort needed to do their job well—is critical to high-performing businesses. Individuals are more engaged at work when they have clarity. Clarity helps individuals better understand how their work connects to the organization’s objectives so they know where to focus their energy for maximum impact and find their work more rewarding and engaging.
Organizations need new, purpose-built solutions for work management 
Today’s reality is that we are more distributed than ever and are frequently collaborating cross-functionally, across geographies, and with people we have never met in-person. This complexity compounds the larger and more dispersed a company is. Organizations need a work management solution that provides transparency, clarity, and accountability so that individuals and teams know—at any given time—what work needs to get done, by whom and by when. This solution needs to allow organizations to set goals and manage all the underlying portfolios, projects, and tasks needed to achieve them. The solution also needs to scale across every level of the organization so individuals, team leads, and executives can understand and take actions to move work forward in real time.

Our Solution 
While others are building suites of collaboration products for small teams, our strategy is broader. We are a pure play work management company, committed to building the best platform capable of serving organizations of all sizes around the world. 
With Asana:
•Individuals can manage and prioritize across each of their projects to maximize their effectiveness and reduce distractions. They can see their own tasks, how dependencies owned by teammates are tracking, and how their work contributes to the overall team and organization-wide goals. Individuals can collaborate with teammates and have visibility into each team member’s responsibilities and progress. When teammates operate off a single, real-time plan of record, they do not need to check in with each other for updates or sit through status meetings. This clarity reduces work about work and helps individuals get work done faster. 
•Team leads can manage work across a portfolio of projects or processes. Team leads see progress, bottlenecks, resource constraints, and milestones without having to create work for teams to come up with this information in spreadsheets, email, or via a status meeting. When surprises or disruptions occur, it is easy for team leads to adjust the plan, reallocate resources, and communicate updates in real time. 
•Executives can communicate company-wide goals, monitor status, and oversee work across projects to gain real-time insights into which initiatives are on track or at risk. With this visibility, they can proactively ensure alignment, address inefficiencies, manage team workload, and reallocate work among teams or departments so that the company can stay on track to achieve its objectives. 
As the system of record of past, current, and future work, Asana is powered by a proprietary, multi-dimensional data model called the Asana Work Graph. The Asana Work Graph captures and associates units of work (tasks, projects, milestones, goals, and portfolios), the people responsible for executing those units of work, the processes in which work gets done (rules, templates, and workflows), information about that work (files, comments, status, and metadata), and the relationships across and within this data. The Asana Work Graph provides individuals, team leads, and executives with dynamic, up-to-date views into the work that is most relevant to them, across multiple people and projects. 
The core tenet of our platform is to bring clarity, transparency, and accountability to the process of getting work done. 
Clarity. Our platform adds structure to unstructured work so everyone on a team has clarity into exactly what needs to be done, by whom and by when. Our multi-dimensional data model provides different views so individuals can not only see the tasks they are working on, but also understand how their individual work contributes to a broader project goal. 
Transparency. Our platform provides transparency into the work being done across a project or portfolio of projects so everyone can see progress to completion, manage deadlines, identify and resolve bottlenecks, and rebalance workloads in real time. 
Accountability. Our platform enables teams to assign work to individuals with completion dates and requirements, eliminating ambiguity over responsibilities. Individuals can track their action items across projects and manage their time more effectively.

Benefits of Our Solution 
Our platform provides the following benefits for our customers: 
Teams get work done faster 
Asana is a leading platform for cross-functional work thanks to our ability to serve as a system of record across different teams and different projects. This is one of our major differentiators and the key to supporting large, complex organizations.
Streamlined processes 
Our horizontal application allows individuals, teams, and admins to easily customize projects and workflows across a breadth of specific use cases. Once a process is defined, it can be templatized and scaled across an organization for consistent, repeatable process management. Rules and Workflows provide scalable automation for business and project processes, and completion options like approval facilitate clear accountability.
Increased employee engagement 
Our users love Asana because they gain clarity into what they need to do by when and how their contribution is connected to broader organizational goals. This clarity is particularly important for distributed teams and remote employees. By eliminating much of the work about work, we give them back valuable hours in their day to focus on the work that matters, leading to higher productivity, higher engagement, and improved retention. 
Improved confidence and execution 
Using Asana, individuals reduce their anxiety about missing deadlines and having work fall through the cracks. As a system of record for work, Asana stores all task and project information on past and present initiatives so people have greater confidence in meeting deliverables. Individuals, team leads, and executives gain real-time visibility into all the work that is happening in their organization, enabling them to feel organized and in control. 
Improved business continuity for distributed teams and remote work 
Asana gives teams the clarity they need to stay organized and productive wherever they are. Distributed and remote teams can use Asana as a single, real-time plan of record, reducing the need for messaging threads and video calls to coordinate work. Asana is a secure, cloud-based service that is accessible via internet browsers, a desktop application, and a mobile application so that team members can manage their work from wherever they are.
Our Culture
Our company culture is a core driver of our business success and enables us to work towards achieving our mission. A core tenet of our culture is a shared commitment to mindfulness, which informs our product, business, and people decisions and shapes how we interact with each other daily. By investing in diversity and inclusion programs, we help ensure that everyone can thrive and feel a sense of belonging, enabling us to better understand the needs of our diverse customer base and innovate in new and creative ways. We also use Asana ourselves, providing our employees with clarity into how their work contributes to our mission and enabling them to do their most impactful work.

Features of our Platform
Asana is a single unified platform that provides clarity at every level of an organization for individuals, team leads, and executives. It enables organizations to align work to goals, coordinate intra and cross-team work, gain visibility into progress, and scale work securely.
Powered by a proprietary, multi-dimensional data model called the Asana Work Graph, our platform captures the relationship between the work (e.g. tasks, goals, ideas, agenda items), the information about that work (e.g. custom fields, messages, files, dependencies, status), and the people doing the work (e.g. assignees, roles, teams, divisions). Asana provides interactive dynamic views—List, Calendar, Board, Timeline, Goals, Portfolio, Reports and more—so that teams can work together on the same underlying data in whatever way makes most sense to them. 
The Asana platform maintains a robust API that enables developers to build apps on Asana and integrate efficiently with applications like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Salesforce, Gmail, Adobe and many more. Integrations connect Asana with applications so that teams are able to coordinate work, no matter where it occurs. Apps built on Asana may use App Components, which enable developers to display customized widgets, forms, and rules within Asana's user interface that empower teams to work more efficiently.

Asana Work Graph Hierarchy 
 The Asana Work Graph captures the relationships, information, and people connected to units of work—tasks, projects, portfolios, goals, and more—to enable a complete, connected, and up-to-date map of work in an organization. The Asana Work Graph provides unique capabilities to relate work such as multi-homing, which enables work like tasks to be shared between multiple projects or workflows without duplication. Different teams view and share the very same tasks, reducing confusion and work about work.
In contrast, others approach the problem of work management with a container model, relating tables of data which forces units of work into singular constructs; for example, a task can only live in one project or a message can only live in one channel. As a result, tasks and other work often get duplicated which means there is no single source of truth about that particular piece of work.
With the Asana Work Graph's differentiated ability to construct a single source of truth for individuals, teams, and organizations, Asana powers clarity at every level of an organization, regardless of size, structure, and complexity. The Asana Work Graph provides:
•Individuals with dynamic views into the work that is most relevant to them, accelerating adoption, maximizing personal productivity, and empowering individuals with knowledge of how their work has an impact on organizational goals.
•Teams with the ability to view and modify the same work data across different views and create workflows that coordinate complex, cross-team work with ease. 
•Executives with visibility into how daily work connects to higher-level goals and initiatives so they can understand real-time progress.
Tasks
Tasks are the atomic unit of work within the Asana Work Graph. Within tasks, users can assign owners, set due dates and times, attach documents, break the work into subtasks, and define custom fields for information about the 
Table of Contents

task so that everyone knows who is doing what by when and has the information needed to complete the work. Custom fields are metadata that help users organize and track their work. Collaboration including comments, @-mentions, image markup, and text-to-subtask creation are natively built into tasks, ensuring that relevant updates and context stay with the work at hand. Changes in task information made in one view are automatically updated across all views where the task is visible so that users don’t have to re-enter information.
Projects
A project consists of a set of tasks, which can be organized into sections and arranged into dependencies that give teams clarity on plan and process. Projects can be used to accomplish a specific goal, such as delivering a presentation or campaign, or can be used to intake and process requests, such as a help desk or creative production. If the project is a workflow the team normally follows, it can be converted into a template, making it easy to set up a repeatable workflow so that teams do not have to start from scratch or miss any steps.
Portfolios
Portfolios let users organize projects into a centralized location, acting as the mission control so that team leads and executives have real-time visibility into how work is progressing across projects. Users can add or remove projects from the Portfolio, check the status and progress of each project, view priorities, assign relevant project owners, and manage custom fields. Individuals can click on any project to see a full summary overview of the project with the ability to edit due dates, view key milestones, link to the tasks and resources available, check or add status updates, and add comments for the team. They can also see all projects within a Portfolio on the Portfolio’s Timeline to get a bird’s-eye view of when initiatives are kicking off and when they will be completed. Portfolio dashboards and custom field roll ups for key metrics like budget and time and more, give leaders a window into the status and ROI of their investments directly from the Portfolios tab. By streamlining and providing a single view of the health and status of strategic initiatives, capacity, and budgets, leaders can take actions faster to drive business outcomes. Like many of the views in Asana, the layout of Portfolios can be customized based on individual preference. Portfolios can be shared broadly or with specific teams or individuals.
Goals
Goals gives users a centralized place to plan, set, and track goals and the work needed to achieve them. Goals is a flexible system that supports objectives and key results (“OKR”) and other goal management methodologies. Users can set and view goals at the organization, team, or individual level and can create goal hierarchies to drive alignment across teams. Goals are connected to the underlying work (Portfolios, Projects, and Tasks) needed to achieve them, giving executives and team leads a single system to set goals and track progress. The progress of goals can be automatically tracked based on linked work and goals without manual updates and goal reporting enables leaders to keep an eye on their team’s advancements and spot roadblocks in real time. Goals can be connected to mission-critical tools across an organization’s tech stack to get actionable insights. Goals can be shared across every level of the organization, while preventing unintended edits with permissions. Customizable views ensure only the most relevant information is given to each teammate. Goals can be kept private or made visible so all team members have clarity on the company’s priorities and see how their work contributes to the organization’s success.
Dynamic Views
Home
Home is a customizable launchpad to help users focus on their most important priorities and projects. Home puts each individual's personal slice of the Asana Work Graph at the center of their Asana, to prioritize their workday, see how their tasks impact the overall workflow, and connect with collaborators from the get-go. Users 
Table of Contents

can drag-and-drop and reconfigure the layout of widgets to personalize and quickly get insight into the work that matters most.
My Tasks
My Tasks provides a single, clear view of every task and due date assigned to an individual so that they start their day knowing exactly what they need to do, by when. Items can be organized, labeled, and dragged and dropped into different categories so that individuals can prioritize their part of a project or any process-related tasks. Individuals can create rules for their own My Tasks to automate tracking their work. My Tasks also integrates with an individual’s existing apps, creating an accurate picture of all in-flight work.
All individuals have their own My Tasks and can customize it in a way that works best for them by viewing their tasks in List, Board, or Weekly Calendar View. Team members can view other team members’ tasks to see what they are working on, subject to permissions associated with that task or individual. Individuals also have the option to create private tasks, which are only visible to themselves and the people they have explicitly added as collaborators.
Inbox
Inbox is the notification center for Asana. It displays updates on all projects that individuals are a member of and tasks that they follow or are assigned so that they can stay on top of the work that matters. Task and project updates—such as when a task is marked complete, a comment is added, or the status of a project is updated—trigger a notification that appears in the Inbox of anyone who follows the task or belongs to the project, unless that person has modified their notification settings for that project. Individuals can filter their Inbox based on tasks assigned to them, tasks they’ve assigned to others and tasks where they are @-mentioned so they can focus on their top priorities.
List View
The List view of a project lets individuals sort, organize into sections, and filter a list of tasks. Tasks can be dragged and dropped, and filtered and sorted according to what matters most so project teams can see all the work needed to complete a project and easily drill down into details. Keyboard shortcuts can be used to move tasks up or down the list, and a project toolbar allows users to adjust their project view.
Calendar View
Calendar view displays tasks within the project on a calendar based on due date and, optionally, start and end dates, so that individuals can see how many tasks are due within a time period and stay on top of their deadlines. Individuals can contribute tasks to a team calendar, plan their work on a schedule, and then easily drag and drop tasks to make adjustments. Individuals can see their personal task list, all the tasks within a specific project, as well as all tasks across projects relevant to a team on a calendar. 
Board View
Boards provide individuals with a kanban-style display. Individuals use boards to plan and organize their work as if they were organizing sticky notes in columns on a wall so that they can quickly visualize the current stage of each task within a workstream. Tasks in the project are represented as cards within the columns and individuals commonly use the columns to represent stages in a workflow. As a task makes its way through the workflow, it moves from the left to the right. The tasks display due dates, assignee, custom fields, subtasks, comments, and previews of the latest attached files.
Boards can be customized to what matters most to the user, with the ability to add custom fields, filter, and sort by task, assignee, or due date. Additionally, tasks appearing in one board can be added to other projects so that work stays connected and up to date across initiatives without team members having to re-enter information.
Table of Contents

Timeline View
Timeline allows teams to create and visualize project plans over time so that individuals can identify bottlenecks and task dependencies and make real-time adjustments as needed. Our Timeline view is more powerful than a static Gantt chart because it is connected to the underlying work and updates dynamically as work progresses. When a deadline shifts, all subsequent deadlines can shift accordingly with the option to maintain the existing buffer between tasks. Timeline helps ensure work stays on track and all team members have clear visibility over the steps involved and progress towards the end goal.
Timeline is particularly relevant for time-bounded initiatives which have timing and sequencing dependencies. Timeline also provides executives and project stakeholders an at-a-glance view of the critical path.
Workload
Workload visualizes the work, capacity, and trendline of each team member so that team leads have accurate and up-to-date information into the workload of their team members. The trendline is generated by number of tasks or numerical custom field values such as estimated hours or effort. Team leads can set capacity and be notified when team members are overloaded. Individuals can reallocate work from one team member to another with a drag-and-drop interface. 
Dashboards
Dashboards help customers visualize and communicate their team’s work in more meaningful ways. Dashboards provide customizable charts that auto-populate with real-time work insights like how many tasks have been completed and who is overloaded – all with no coding or search queries required.
Automated Workflows
Workflow Builder
Previously, only IT or system administrators could build workflows. We have democratized that power with Workflow Builder, a point-and-click tool that makes it easy for every knowledge worker to create automated workflows.
Users can also add everyday apps — like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Adobe Creative Cloud, Salesforce, and Zoom – right into their workflows. This means Asana can serve as the connective tissue across existing best-of-breed collaboration solutions.
Our Template Library is where users can save, share, and reuse their most successful workflows. It also features industry-approved templates made in collaboration with leading organizations around the globe.
Rules
Rules help automate tedious and repetitive tasks so that teams can reduce manual work and spend more time on the work that matters. Individuals can select from suggested pre-built rules from the rules gallery or they can create a custom rule. A rule consists of one or more triggers and actions, enabling an individual to create logic and multiple actions around business scenarios. Actions in third-party applications that are integrated with Asana, such as Gmail, Microsoft, Slack, Jira, HubSpot, and Dropbox can also trigger rules, making it easy to automate manual work across applications.
Universal Reporting
Asana's Universal Reporting gives real-time, actionable insights into teams’ progress across the entire organization. Powered by the Asana Work Graph, users can create charts on any stream of work or goals and clickthrough on any section to see the underlying data and understand where work stands. Individuals can use this information to communicate progress to stakeholders with Status Reports or build comprehensive Project Dashboards to monitor and track the health of their workflows. 
Table of Contents

When users need to find specific information, Advanced Search allows individuals to use search parameters to find tasks, projects, and messages quickly and easily. Search criteria can then be saved and easily referenced with just a single click.
Integrations
Integrations connect applications to Asana, which provides a central hub for managing work. Teams save time by eliminating the need to switch between apps. By providing this centralized hub, Asana ensures that cross-functional work in other tools is tracked and completed.
The Asana platform integrates with over 260 third-party applications including:
•Microsoft 365 apps such as Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, Power Automate, Power Bi, and Azure Active Directory;

Commitment to Security and Privacy
Upholding the trust that we have established with our customers and gaining the trust of new customers remains a priority for us and as a result, we have implemented robust safeguards to protect the security of customer data. Our security program includes conducting risk assessments of all systems and networks that process customer data; monitoring for security events; maintaining incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans that explicitly address and provide guidance to our personnel in furtherance of the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data; and having a qualified third party perform security assessments on a periodic basis to test against widely recognized security standards and practices. 
Our security program is aligned to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality as well as the ISO 27001:2013 standards. We issue a SOC 2 Type II report on an annual basis and are certified against ISO 27001:2013, ISO 27017:2015, ISO 27018:2019, and ISO/IEC 27701:2019. This means that independent third parties have both validated our processes and practices with respect to these standards, and confirmed our ability to maintain compliance with controls we have implemented. 
We have built our platform with security features, integrations, and infrastructure that are designed to be scalable as we develop and introduce new functionality. We have implemented a variety of safeguards to protect the security of our platform, including encrypting user data in transit and at rest, replicating our databases to support reliability of the platform, and controlling access to our facilities and office network. Asana also offers Enterprise customers the additional visibility and control with capabilities such as multi-factor authentication, audit logs, security information event management (“SIEM”), data governance, and international data residency, to further the security of their teams’ data. Enterprise customers can also purchase Enterprise Key Management to gain more control over their data and meet their organization’s most critical compliance needs. 
In addition to security, we are deeply committed to privacy and to protecting and honoring the privacy rights of our customers. We have established a comprehensive privacy and data protection compliance program, aligning our practices with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and privacy certifications such as ISO/IEC 27701:2019 and ISO 27018:2019, including by delivering periodic training to our employees on privacy best practices, reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share, and creating a customer rights program and response process to honor the requests of our customers exercising their privacy rights. Additionally, Enterprise customers can purchase a version of Asana that is compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Above all, we strive to be transparent about our privacy and data protection practices, independent of legal obligations. Law and regulatory guidance continues to evolve when it comes to privacy and data protection. As data protection authorities and regulators interpret and issue guidance on the GDPR, along with other new and existing data protection laws around the world, we will continue to follow developments and enhance our program as needed.
Governmental Regulation
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information, including personal information. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous privacy, data protection, and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the CCPA, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). Several states within the United States have enacted or proposed privacy, data protection, and security laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. Additionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information.

The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal information processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal information (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal information processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal information, and to opt out of certain personal information disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), effective January 1, 2023, expanded the CCPA by, among other things, giving California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, establishing restrictions on personal data retention, expanding the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.
Foreign privacy, data protection, and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal information processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal information processing; complying with specific requirements to process health-related data; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal information; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal information; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
See the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information about some of the laws and regulations to which we may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Our Customers
We have customers of all sizes ranging from individuals to global organizations. We define a customer as a distinct account, which could include a team, company, educational or government institution, organization, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a paid subscription plan, a free version, or a free trial of one of our paid subscription plans. A single organization may have multiple customers. We define a paying customer as a customer on a paid subscription plan. As of January 31, 2023, we had over 139,000 paying customers globally, representing an increase of approximately 20,000 paying customers from January 31, 2022 and an increase of approximately 46,000 from January 31, 2021. Of those paying customers, 19,432 spent $5,000 or more with us on an annualized basis, representing an increase of 3,995 paying customers from January 31, 2022 and an increase of 9,258 paying customers from January 31, 2021. Additionally, 506 of those paying customers spent $100,000 or more with us on an annualized basis, representing an increase of 166 paying customers from January 31, 2022 and an increase of 358 paying customers from January 31, 2021.
Our current customer base spans numerous industry categories, including technology, retail, education, non-profit, government, healthcare, hospitality, media, manufacturing, professional services, and financial services, and includes many category leaders across these diverse industries. 
Sales and Marketing
We employ a hybrid go-to-market approach, combining a product-led model with direct sales efforts. We are focused on landing teams worldwide and expanding across use cases, both within and between organizations, to ensure the success of our customers. This in turn creates positive word-of-mouth marketing, driving adoption, expansion and ultimately our business results.
Table of Contents

Product-led
A majority of our paying customers initially adopt our platform through product-led channels, like signing up on our website, and free trials. To demonstrate the value of our platform to potential paying customers, we provide free trials of our paid Asana Business offering, in addition to our free Basic offering, for teams of up to 15 people. As individuals, teams, and their guests realize the productivity benefits we provide, Asana becomes an integral part of their day-to-day work and critical to helping them achieve their objectives.
Direct Sales
In conjunction with our product-led model, we have a targeted direct sales team focused on promoting new use cases and expanding our footprint within our existing customer base. Our direct sales force has a global presence, and consists of sales teams focused primarily on accounts with expansion opportunities including department-specific and organization-wide use cases such as strategic planning, employee onboarding, and goal setting. 
Marketing and Customer Success
We market our platform through owned properties, such as our website and social media channels, media coverage, paid acquisition, and word of mouth to promote discovery and adoption. Every month millions of people visit asana.com, and hundreds of thousands of people register for the product. Our customers also have the ability to invite external parties to collaborate on specific Asana projects, which supports viral adoption of our platform.
We offer on-demand education available in-product and online, and via live learning courses as well as robust customer support available in six languages. We also offer our customers the option to partner with a list of managed service providers, consulting firms, and system integrators to help customize their account, onboard teams and run onsite training.
Our global community of customers and experts, Asana Together, connects customers, both online and offline, and creates champions. Through Asana Together, customers have access to our Community Forum to ask questions and connect with peers. We also support Asana Ambassadors (go-to enthusiasts who assist with and promote adoption within their networks) and Asana Partners (independent third-party Asana consultants, resellers, and system integrators who offer their services for a discretionary fee to help teams make the most of their experience on our platform). Through Asana Together, we have hosted multiple in-person events on five different continents.
Effects of Inflation
We believe inflation in the regions where most of our sales occur has not had a significant effect on our net revenues or profitability.
Research and Development
Key to our success is the time, attention, and investment we place on continued innovation in our platform. We will continue to invest in expanding our product offerings and enhancing the features and functionality of our platform, particularly in the areas of integrations, automation, functional workflows, security, and organization-wide use cases. We leverage the breadth of our customer base, and the diverse ways in which they use our platform, to recognize their needs quickly and guide future product development and innovation. Further, we ourselves are users—all of our employees are committed to using Asana internally, every single day—ensuring our entire organization is in touch with the platform’s capabilities and can rapidly identify or suggest improvements. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of solutions for our platform. 
Our Competition
The market for work management platforms is increasingly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapidly changing technology, shifting user and customer needs, new market entrants, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete with companies that range in size, from large and diversified with significant spending resources to smaller companies. The work management solutions market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry, and in the future there will likely be an increasing number of 
Table of Contents

similar solutions offered by additional competitors. Our competition addresses the project management and work management categories, including, but not limited to, solutions around email, messaging, and spreadsheets. Our competitors fall into the following groups: companies specifically offering work management solutions; companies offering productivity suites; and companies specializing in vertical solutions.
We believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:
•adaptability to a broad range of use cases;
•features and functionality of platform capabilities;
•developments and enhancements of work management solutions;
•customer service and support efforts;
•hybrid go-to-market model;
•ease of use, performance, price, and reliability of solutions;
•scalability and security;
•brand strength; and
•ability to create easy to use integrations for, and robust, effective partnerships with, other larger enterprise software solutions and tools.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws, and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses, and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we, therefore, may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our platform. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify, and redistribute certain parts of our service. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
As of January 31, 2023, we had been granted 41 U.S. patents, had 73 U.S. patent applications pending, and four notices of allowance. Our issued patents expire between January 2030 and March 2042. We have not applied for patents in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. 
Government Regulation 
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Human Capital Management
We aim to be the change we want to see in the workplace. This strategy makes us a better company and contributes to the type of culture we want to work in: inclusive, dynamic, and engaging. 
We believe fundamentally that the investments we make in our company culture help to fuel our business success. On Glassdoor, we’ve consistently had an overall score of greater than 4.5 out of 5.0 and greater than 90% for our ratings of “CEO approval” and “Recommend to a Friend”. Our focus on building an inclusive, dynamic, and engaging company culture has led to global recognition, as evidenced by the following awards:
•Great Place to Work and Fortune Best Workplaces in the Bay Area 2022 for the sixth year in a row, debuting at #18 for our first year in the large company category;
•Great Place to Work and Fortune Best Workplaces for Millennials 2022 #9 for the fifth year in a row;
•Great Place to Work and Fortune Best Workplaces in Technology 2022 for the fifth year in a row, debuting at #21 for our first year in the large company category;
•Great Place to Work and Fortune Best Workplaces 2022 #9 for Women for the fifth year in a row;
•Great Place to Work and Fortune Best Workplaces for Parents 2022 for the third year in a row, #22 out of 70 and for the first time in the large company category;
•Inc. Best Workplaces 2022 for the fifth year in a row; and
•Glassdoor Best Places to Work 2023 #63.
In our most recent global employee engagement survey, 80% of our employees indicated they would recommend Asana as a great place to work and 80% reported feeling an overall sense of belonging.
Asana employed 1,782 people as of January 31, 2023, of which approximately 78% were located in the United States and approximately 22% were located internationally.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
We believe the best teams are diverse in identity, background, and perspectives. In 2015, we created a dedicated diversity, inclusion, and belonging (“DIB”) function. Our DIB programs support every employee at Asana to thrive, enabling us to better serve the needs of our diverse customer base. Our DIB strategy can be broken down into three elements: 
1.Building a strong foundation of support and resources for employees, 
2.Recruiting and developing talent from underrepresented groups and backgrounds, and 
3.Creating an environment that allows our employees to thrive and do their best work. 
Build: We’re intentional about laying a foundation of support and resources for our employees to be successful including:
•Comprehensive DIB onboarding curriculum for new employees
•Mandatory anti-harassment training
•Bias awareness training
•Psychological safety workshops for managers and their teams
•Inclusive leadership workshops for managers
Table of Contents

•16 weeks of parental leave, regardless of gender
Recruit: We believe hiring and developing talent from underrepresented groups and backgrounds is a shared responsibility. Some examples of how we have taken on some of that responsibility here at Asana are detailed below.
•Establishing representation goals related to race/ethnicity and gender, across our functions
•Auditing and building equitable hiring processes
•Dedicated outreach to candidates from underrepresented communities
•Partnering with organizations aligned with underrepresented communities in the technology space including Techqueria, AfroTech, Year Up, and The Marcy Lab School
•Developing individual careers through AsanaUp, our apprenticeship program focused on providing pathways to roles at Asana for individuals from historically marginalized communities
•Inclusivity, Diversity, and Equity for Asana Leadership (“IDEAL”) Interviewing Policy, which ensures we interview at least one candidate from an underrepresented group and one non-male candidate for every leadership role
Thrive: Our goal is to create an environment so inclusive that every employee of Asana feels confident bringing the parts of themselves to work that they need to in order to thrive in their role. We have taken several steps to cultivate an inclusive company culture including:
•Thriving online communities that connect through social engagement and open conversations. This includes facilitating discussions on issues that are important to our communities, including race, sexuality, mental health and allyship, promoting belonging and psychological safety. 
•Supporting and funding seven Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) each supported by a sponsor ERG Lead (a senior member of our leadership team): AsanaWomen, AsanaWomen EMEA, Asanapac, Blacsana, Gradient, Raíz, and Team Rainbow. All ERG Leads also participate in an ERG Leadership Development program designed to strengthen leadership skills.
In addition to our ERGs, we support employee driven communities for parents and caregivers, mental health and wellness, and people with disabilities. 
•Providing robust mental health and wellness benefits, including free therapy and mental health coaching sessions for all employees.
•Establishing a DIB Council, an internal group of cross-functional stakeholders including executive leaders that weigh in on and provide perspectives on various initiatives undertaken by the DIB team.
•Signing amicus briefs that support inclusion and equity, including: opposing anti-transgender laws, supporting the Voting Rights Act of 1965, opposing restricting access to reproductive healthcare, supporting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, supporting non-discrimination rights for LGBTQ+ Americans, and supporting protection for sanctuary cities in the United States.
These DIB initiatives have helped us cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce. As of January 31, 2023, of our global workforce approximately 44% identify as Caucasian, 40% identify as Asian, 7% identify as Hispanic or Latinx, 5% identify as Black or African American, 2% identify as Middle Eastern, 1% identify as Pacific Islander, and 1% identify as Native American, Alaskan, Indigenous. Additionally, of our global workforce, as of January 31, 2023, approximately 45% of our employees identify as female, 54% identify as male, and 1% identify as TGNC, which includes the categories of agender, gender non-conforming, genderqueer, transgender, and non-binary.

Compensation and Benefits
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive cash compensation, opportunities for equity ownership at all levels of the organization, development programs that enable continued learning and growth (including access to 1:1 professional coaching for every employee) and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement savings vehicles, and paid time off. Our compensation programs are designed to align employee interests with the long-term success of the company and to foster cross-business collaboration. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we invest in ongoing leadership development through programs such as our Conscious Leadership training program, and encourage managers to utilize development offerings in our learning and development platform. In addition, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
Pay Equity
We run a regression-based analysis of our pay by gender identity globally (where we are legally allowed to collect this data) and our pay by race/ethnicity in North America to ensure our compensation practices are equitable. We run this analysis at least twice a year in partnership with a third-party pay equity firm. We have a dedicated budget maintained to remediate statistically significant, systematic pay gaps that may be discovered in the course of these studies.
Response to COVID-19 Pandemic
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety, health, and wellbeing of all our employees globally. We have a cross-functional task force that meets bi-weekly to assess current conditions and ensure we continue to maintain a safe working environment for all. For example, we temporarily closed our headquarters and other physical offices when COVID-19 was at its respective peaks, ensured all of our employees and contractors were set up to work remotely, and implemented in-person meeting and business travel restrictions. After opening our headquarters and other physical offices to employees and shifting to an office-centric hybrid model, we provided personal protective equipment and COVID-19 test kits to all employees, required proof of full vaccination or proof of negative COVID-19 test result to work in the office (for those locations where we are legally able to do so), and have set parameters to make in-office collaboration voluntary in times of increased community spread.
