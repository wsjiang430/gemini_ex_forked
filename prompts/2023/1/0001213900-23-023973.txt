ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview



DecisionPoint Systems, Inc. (“DecisionPoint”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was originally organized in August 2010 under the laws of the Province of Ontario and subsequently filed a Certificate of Corporate Domestication with the State of Delaware on June 14, 2011



The Company, through its subsidiaries, consults, designs, and implements mobility-first enterprise solutions and services that support our customer’s operations. DecisionPoint provides managed and professional services that better enable our customers to implement and manage complex projects on time and on budget.

Our ViziTrace Platform provides our customers with the ability to integrate radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technology’s into existing workflows, making them more efficient and effective in the marketplace. Our Managed Services offerings provide our customers a way to implement, manage, monitor, and maintain all these technologies for the lifetime of the implementation, while supporting and augmenting our customer’s IT teams.



Acquisitions have been an important element of our growth strategy and are expected to be in the future. We have supplemented our organic growth by identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that results in broader, more sophisticated product offerings, while diversifying and expanding our customer base and markets. In 2018, we acquired Royce Digital Systems, Inc. (“RDS”), a provider of innovative enterprise solutions. RDS has expanded our product portfolio with mission critical printers, consumables and custom labels and a wide array of on-site professional services. Additionally, RDS has provided new opportunities in the healthcare sector which is incremental to our existing markets of Retail and Logistics. In December 2020, we acquired ExtenData Solutions, LLC (“ExtenData”), an enterprise mobility solutions provider headquartered in the Denver metropolitan area. ExtenData’s products and services are synergistic and complimentary to those provided by the Company. The ExtenData acquisition was intended to enhance and supplement the products and services offered by the Company and broaden our customer base. In January 2022, we acquired Advanced Mobile Group, LLC (“AMG”), a company that brings skills in voice directed technologies and RFID via the ViziTrace Platform.

As a result, our customers are able to move their business decision points closer to their customers: improving customer service levels, reducing costs and accelerating business growth.

Mobility solutions and usage, in general, continue to grow and change rapidly. Many companies are leveraging mobile solutions to deliver information to their associates and customers in new and innovative ways that create competitive differentiation. Rapid change and innovation lead to increasingly complex solutions and requirements. Internal IT staff can be overwhelmed by the complexity of managing and operationalizing these mobile solutions. DecisionPoint seeks to eliminate this complexity through our managed services offerings to allow our customers to focus their resources on business transformation and bottom-line results.



A comprehensive mobile solution requires close coordination with many suppliers such as Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) manufacturers, carriers, security organizations, software providers and others.



We have developed an ‘ecosystem’ of partners to support the assembly and manufacturing provisions of our custom and off-the-shelf solutions, including handheld device manufacturers, independent software vendors and wireless carriers.



DecisionPoint has offices throughout North America with service centers located on both the East and West Coast allowing us to serve multi-location clients and their mobile workforces.



Our Markets and Primary Customer Industries



DecisionPoint is a mobile systems integrator providing enterprise mobility solutions to the retail, logistics and healthcare markets. These solutions span the complete technology life cycle from systems design and implementation capabilities to a complete portfolio of support services including repair center services and managed mobile services.



During 2022 we developed a new portal, VISION. VISION is intended to offer our customers a customizable solution for monitoring actions on everything in their IT infrastructure.   Decisionpoint can manage the entire lifecycle of Mobility and IT infrastructure all in one view. VISION provides real-time visibility to manage the health, location, and status of mission-critical IT assets; VISION also enables clients to monitor the progress in major rollouts.  This enables our customers to minimize downtime and simplifying the management of a large, distributed enterprise.



 VISION is intended to allow customers to:




● | Track assets by location and health status via an interactive map;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Monitor servers, switches, PC’s, and POS systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Deploy custom configured Mobile Devices and the surrounding Infrastructure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engage in custom asset tagging;
--+--------------------------------


● | Engage in RMA creation with advanced exchange management
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Monitor and effect repair and refurbishment of assets
--+------------------------------------------------------

Retail In-Store Operations



We assist retail customers in selecting and procuring the correct technology, deploying and installing it and managing that technology for its entire life cycle. Our VISION portal and OnPoint asset management system helps our retail customers with distributed stores and networks manage support, repairs, returns and every facet of the life of their POS systems and mobile devices. This allows our customers’ IT resources to be leveraged for competitive advantage as we take care of this critical function.

Warehousing and Distribution



DecisionPoint provides products and services to large retailers, warehouses and third-party logistics providers to ensure their logistics operations are modern, efficient and provides them with a competitive advantage. We work closely with our customers to select the right technology in a rapidly changing world intended to give them return on investment throughout its lifetime of deployment. Applications such as Yard Management, Receiving, Picking, Hands-Free, and Voice are all components of a system that provide value. DecisionPoint assists our customers to manage the largest of projects with flawless execution along with the lifecycle management services that keep those IT assets operational.
Healthcare



Through the acquisition of RDS in 2018, DecisionPoint expanded its presence in healthcare. RDS has provided hardware, integration, IT Services, and a myriad of healthcare solutions to one of the largest systems in the country for 25+ years supporting clinical workflows throughout the healthcare systems. DecisionPoint currently provides service on-site for more than 30,000 IT assets, such as Barcode printers and scanners. That expertise combined with our account base of healthcare systems and healthcare manufacturing makes this vertical our second largest vertical as of December 31, 2022.
Wholesale Distribution



Through the acquisition of ExtenData, DecisionPoint added to its portfolio of reoccurring revenue with the MobileConductor (MC) software platform. MC is application software sold into the Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and Proof of Delivery (POD) marketplace in a SaaS model. MobileConductor enables us to provide complete in-vehicle solutions inclusive of hardware and services.
Field Sales and Service



DecisionPoint has and expects to roll-out a new tablet system for field representatives of large enterprise customers. DecisionPoint co-developed the software hand-in-hand with its customers operations team that is intended to improve the efficiencies of customer field representatives and make it easier for them to record deliveries, pick-ups and transact sales on the spot. This tablet system has been a multi-year project, which continues to evolve and improve our customer’s competitive position.



The field sales and service market is experiencing significant growth. This space has evolved and moved from rugged to consumer technologies in many instances. As a result, DecisionPoint intends to leverage our experience to expand our offerings and options for our customers as the technology changes and evolves. DecisionPoint intends to provide its complete line of services, including custom or packaged software solutions to these markets, representing another area of potential growth.



Services



Lifecycle Management



As part of our services, DecisionPoint, helps customers maximize the life of their IT assets. When OEMs discontinue a product or provide poor service on an aging product it can force our customers into an upgrade, they may not be ready to manage or afford. We work closely with our customers in all verticals to attempt to provide them extra value at the end of an asset’s lifecycle.
Deployment and Project Management



Project management and deployment services are also an area of focus for the Company. DecisionPoint’s project management team has handled nationwide retail point of sale deployments and a myriad of other projects that augment customer IT teams. The same applies to healthcare where we have the expertise to understand clinical workflows and how an IT implementation needs to be executed.

As a Service



DecisionPoint also offers “as a service models” that include devices, services, software and consulting in one monthly recurring charge.



Software



The market for enterprise mobile software is generally specialized. Enterprise mobile software systems must support industry-specific and customer-specific business processes. For this reason, we utilize several avenues to provide mobile software solutions to meet our customers’ unique requirements, including:

● | Software as a Service: SaaS is a core strategy to grow our recurring revenue base. In 2020, Decisionpoint acquired ExtenData’s MobileConductor (trademarked), a software platform targeted at the Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and the Proof of Delivery (POD) markets. In 2022, Decisionpoint acquired Advanced Mobile Group’s VizeTrace (trademarked), a software platform that manages RFID installations. Both MobileConductor and ViziTrace are owned platforms of Decisionpoint and part of its expanded IP portfolio. They will continue to be sold, supported and leveraged across our expanded base of customers nationwide. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Resold specialized ISV applications: The software produced by specialized independent software vendors (“ISV”) is designed to fit a particular vertical market and application. Even still, it must be tailored to meet the needs of each customer and often requires integration to the customer’s enterprise system(s). Depending on the requirements, this tailoring is provided by DecisionPoint under contract with DecisionPoint. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DecisionPoint custom development: When one of our off-the-shelf solutions or other ISV solution is not available, custom software can be created in-house using standardized programming platforms like the Microsoft.NET® framework, Java™, Android and Apple iOS. These are used when there is simply no other “off-the-shelf” way to meet the customer’s requirements or when a client believes their business requirements are so unique that only a custom solution will work. An increasingly popular requirement for many corporate clients, which we are able to fulfill, is a custom application that is written once, but supports multiple mobile operating systems. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers



Our customers include large enterprise companies across a wide range of industries including retail, healthcare, transportation and logistics.



No arrangement between us and any customer provide for a minimum amount of products or services that must be purchased by the customer nor require any customer to exclusively utilize us as a provider.
Backlog



At December 31, 2022, our backlog related to product orders that are expected to ship throughout 2023 was approximately $30.3 million.



Competition



The automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) business is one that is highly fragmented and covered by many competitors that range from a one-man shop to multi-billion-dollar companies. DecisionPoint attempts to separate itself from the competition with our expertise and ability to help a customer manage an entire project versus buying a product.

The following companies are examples of competitors in the AIDC Industry:




● | CDW Corporation – CDW provides thousands of products as a general IT supplier. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Denali Advanced Integration – Washington-based Denali Advanced Integration is a full system integration company with services ranging from IT Consulting, Managed Services and Enterprise Mobility Solutions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Competitors in the U.S. – Certain ‘catalog and online’ AIDC equipment resellers offer end-users deeply discounted, commodity-oriented products; however, they typically offer limited or no maintenance support beyond the manufacturer’s warranty (which generally results in slower repair turnaround time). More importantly, as end users have become increasingly dependent on value added resellers (“VAR”) and system integrators to provide platform design, integration and maintenance, end users typically do not place major purchase orders with such resellers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppliers



Products from three suppliers, Scansource, Bluestar, and Ingram Micro totaled approximately 78% of our cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.



Intellectual Property



We own and maintain a portfolio of intellectual property assets which we hope to continue to build. We believe that our intellectual property assets create great value to us and therefore we take steps to protect those assets. However, because of the nature of our business and assets we have not sought patent or trademark protection of our intellectual property assets.
Employees



As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of approximately 116 full-time employees. We have not experienced any work disruptions or stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Legal Proceedings; Product Liability



From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. Currently, we are not a party to any material legal proceedings or subject to any material claims. The results of any future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
