ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Intellinetics is a Nevada holding company incorporated in 1997, with two wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Intellinetics, Ohio, an Ohio corporation and (ii) Graphic Sciences, a Michigan corporation. Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization. On March 2, 2020, Intellinetics purchased Graphic Sciences, Inc.
 
We are a document services and software solutions company serving both the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors with their digital transformation and process automation initiatives. On April 1, 2022, we made a significant business acquisition that has significantly impacted our financial operations and grown our business operations. For further information about this acquisition, please see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.
 
Our digital transformation products and services are provided through two reporting segments: Document Management and Document Conversion. Our Document Management segment, which includes the Yellow Folder, LLC (“Yellow Folder”) asset acquisition in April 2022, consists primarily of solutions involving our software platform, allowing customers to capture and manage their documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. Our Document Conversion segment provides assistance to customers as a part of their overall document strategy to convert documents from one medium to another, predominantly paper to digital, including migration to our software solutions, as well as long-term storage and retrieval services. Our solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the people who need them by making those documents easy to find and access, while also being secure and compliant with the customers’ audit requirements. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers.
 
Our customers use our software by one of two methods: purchasing our software and installing it onto their own equipment, which we refer to as a “premise” model, or licensing and accessing our platform via the Internet, which we refer to as a “software as a service” or “SaaS” model and also as a “cloud-based” model. Licensing of our software through our SaaS model has become increasingly popular among our customers, especially in light of the increased deployment of remote workforce policies, and is a key ingredient in our revenue growth strategy. Our SaaS products are hosted with Amazon Web Services, Expedient, and Evocative, providing our customers with reliable hosting services that we believe are consistent with industry best practices in data security and performance.
 
We operate a U.S.-based business with concentrated sales to the State of Michigan for our Document Conversion segment, complemented by our diverse set of document management software solutions and services. We hold or compete for leading positions regionally in select markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative solutions, and the quality of our service support. Net growth in sales of software as a service in recent years reflects market demand for these solutions over traditional sales of on-premise software. We expect to continue to benefit from our select niche leadership market positions, innovative product offerings, growing customer base, and the impact of our sales and marketing programs. Examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and expanded market penetration opportunities, more effective products and services pricing strategies, demonstrating superior value to customers, increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and measurement, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes.
 
Software and Services
 
Document Management
 
Our flagship software platforms include a) IntelliCloud™, reflecting our focus, and the market’s focus, on growth via cloud-based content management and process automation, and b) YellowFolder™, a specialized content management software solution for the K-12 education market. Our Document Management business also generates software-related professional services that include installation, integration, training, and consulting services, as well as ongoing software maintenance and customer support.

-


The IntelliCloud™ suite of software is comprised of stand-alone and integrated modules that include:
 

● | Image Processing: includes image processing modules used for capturing, transforming and managing images of paper documents, including support of distributed and high-volume capture, optical character recognition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Accounts Payable lifecycle automation, including advanced capture for invoice processing. 
● | Records Management: addresses needs relating to retention of content through automation and policies, ensuring legal, regulatory and industry compliance for our clients; 
● | Workflow: supports business processes, routing content electronically for assigning work tasks and approvals, and creating related audit trails, notifications, and escalations; and 
● | Extended Components: includes document composition and e-forms (via third party OEM integration partnership), search, content and web analytics (via third party data visualization and advanced OCR engine partnerships), email and information archiving, and packaged application integration. 

Document Conversion
 
We convert images from paper to digital, paper to microfilm, microfiche to microfilm, and micrographics to digital for businesses and federal, county, and municipal governments. Our Document Conversion business also provides its clients with long-term paper and microfilm storage and retrieval options.
 
The primary Document Conversion offerings are:
 

● | Digital Scanning Services. These services include paper scanning, newspaper and microfilm scanning, microfiche scanning, aperture card scanning, drawing scanning, and book scanning. Most government files must be retained for long terms or permanently, making such clients a prime candidate for digital conversion. There are four production categories for these services, consisting of document prep, scanning, indexing, and delivery. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). BPO contracts provide ongoing outsourcing of customer processes such as mail room activities, where we pick up customer mail from the post office, open it, sort it, scan it, and upload it to the appropriate customer system. 
● | Microfilm and Microfiche. We provide microfilming/microfiche conversion to digital, converting scanned images to microfilm or microfiche, and microfilm/microfiche preservation and duplication. 
● | Box Storage Services. We provide physical document storage and retrieval services for our clients. 
● | Scanning Equipment, Software and Repair. We sell and service document image software, document scanners, and microfilm scanners, readers and printers. This is a smaller, slowly declining part of our Document Conversion business. 

Marketing and Sales
 
We have a multi-channel sales model that directs our sales efforts through direct sales and through intermediaries, such as independent software vendors, resellers and referral partners. Our Document Management and Document Conversion segments each use direct and reseller channels for sales. We have developed partner-specific marketing programs with channel partners. We believe that our channel partner strategy improvements have increased the competitive strength of our platform of products. In addition, we have established a set of business solutions templates for specific vertical markets that provide base software configurations which we believe will facilitate our delivery and installation of software to our customers in both our direct and reseller channels. We believe that these advancements, in the aggregate, will allow us to license and sell our products to a targeted customer base, shortening our sales cycle, making margins more consistent, and allowing us to expand our sales through existing and new reseller partnerships and direct customers. We continue to devote significant efforts, in both development and marketing, in enhancing all channels to market.

Competition and Market Position
 
The market for our products is competitive, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify as the document solutions markets evolve and potentially consolidate. We believe that the trend toward electronic document management, and particularly cloud solutions, was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We believe the primary competitors of our Document Management segment are DocuWare, Square 9, M-files, On-Base, FileBound, Frontline, Laserfiche, Harvest Technology Group, and PowerSchool, who also serve small-to-medium business (SMB), K-12 education, and governmental sectors. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our document conversion services include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
 
We believe the competitors of our Document Conversion segment vary from local niche entities to larger entities, including Iron Mountain. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products and services include: (i) vendor and services reputation and (ii) services quality, performance and price. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer, and that, for our current and prospective customers, maintaining secure control over the customers’ information is highly valued.
 
We believe that the consolidated Company has advantages over our competitors in the small-to-medium business market, and particularly organizations in highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive markets, such as state and local government, non-clinical health care, and K-12 education. In our view, we will remain competitive by remaining a focused niche provider with product offerings aligned with buyer-specific requirements. We anticipate that we will benefit from five specific advantages already in place:
 

● | Turnkey cloud or premise document workflow and document conversion solutions targeting specific industry customers with benchmark value-to-price ratio; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Rigorous quality review process and maintenance of customer data confidentiality in document conversions; 
● | Modular solution packaging and rapid customer activation model; 
● | Integrated on-demand solutions library as standard platform feature; and 
● | Expanded software integration tools that make it easier for independent software vendors to integrate and sell IntelliCloud software capabilities into their customer base. 

 
We believe, with these competitive strengths, that we are well positioned as a cloud-based managed document services provider for the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors.
 
Customers
 
Document Management
 
Our Document Management segment in general has fairly low customer concentration. For 2022, the two largest customers of our Document Management segment accounted for approximately 7% and 2%, respectively, of the segment’s revenues for that period. For 2021, the two largest customers of our Document Management segment accounted for approximately 10% and 4%, respectively, of the segment’s revenues for that period.


For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, government contracts, including K-12 education, represented approximately 77% and 56%, respectively, of the Document Management segment’s net revenues, including a significant portion of the segment’s sales to resellers which represent ultimate sales to government agencies. Due to their dependence on state, local and federal budgets, government contracts carry short terms, typically 12 months. Since our inception, our contracts with government customers have generally renewed on the original terms and conditions upon expiration.

Document Conversion
 
Our Document Conversion segment has significant customer concentration with the State of Michigan. Graphic Sciences’ contract with the State of Michigan is for five years from June 1, 2018 to May 30, 2023 with a provision for two one-year extensions. The contract is issued to Graphic Sciences through the Michigan Department of Management and Budget, Enterprise Procurement and managed through the Department of Management and Budget, Records Management Services Division (RMS).
 
The contract provides local and state government agencies access to digital and micrographic conversion services. These agencies have the option to perform these conversion services internally or go out to bid if they so choose. Typically, they elect to have these services outsourced to Graphic Sciences through RMS, which eliminates the bidding process.
 
All Michigan agencies and departments are able to use the services and prices provided under this contract. Mechanically, the work we perform is invoiced to RMS and the end user is invoiced through the State of Michigan accounting system. We do not invoice the end user directly when entities utilize this contract facility, and we have a single point of contact for managing billing and receipt. The state in effect acts as a reseller of our services to the other agencies and makes a mark-up of what is charged. For 2022, the State of Michigan represented approximately 66% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues, and 38% of the total consolidated revenues. Our second largest customer in 2022 was Rocket Mortgage, representing 11% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues and 6% of the total consolidated revenues. For 2021, the State of Michigan represented approximately 64% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues, and 47% of the total consolidated revenues. Rocket Mortgage represented approximately 12% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues, and 9% of the total consolidated revenues in 2021.

Intellectual Property
 
Our software and most of the underlying technologies are built on a Microsoft.Net framework. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary intellectual property rights.
 
Customers license the right to use our software products on a non-exclusive basis. We grant to third parties rights in our intellectual property that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product or to a particular geographic area.
 
While we believe that our intellectual property as a whole is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
 
Software Development
 
We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products. We continuously monitor our software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. We discuss our accounting for such costs, and when we expense or capitalize, in more detail below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Government Regulation
 
Other than government procurement rules affecting sales to governmental customers and data privacy laws applicable to all businesses, we do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations or approval requirements affecting our products or services. Complying with the regulations and requirements applicable to our business does not entail a significant cost or burden. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.

Human Capital
 
As of March 23, 2023, we employed a total of 166 individuals; all but 27 are full-time employees. Graphic Sciences employs 119 individuals, comprised of 100 full-time and 19 part-time employees, all located in Michigan. Graphic Sciences also utilizes temporary employees, through various agencies, to provide labor for variable project work. Intellinetics Ohio employs 47 individuals, comprised of 39 full-time and 8 part-time employees, primarily located in Ohio and Texas. As a combined company, 21 of our employees work in administration and management, 34 of our employees work in software sales, maintenance and support, and software development, and 111 of our employees work in document services and storage operations.
 
We consider the integrity, experience, dedication, creativity, and team-oriented nature of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and a key to our future prospects. Personal relationships with our existing customers are an important part of our business, and our customers have come to rely on the personal service and knowledge of our workforce across all functional areas. To attract and retain qualified applicants to our company and retain our employees, we offer total benefits packages consisting of base salary or hourly wage (depending on position), a comprehensive benefits package, and equity compensation for certain employees. Annual cash bonuses are based on our profitability, achievement of targets and level of responsibility. When selecting talent, we consider education, experience, diversity, and the likelihood that a candidate will espouse our values of integrity, collaboration, dedication, creativity, and superior customer service.
 
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce that attracts and retains exceptional talent. In addition, we pride ourselves on an open culture that respects co-workers, values employees’ health and well-being and fosters professional development. We support employee growth and development in a variety of ways including with training opportunities and an overall strategy of promotion from within. Our management conducts annual employee engagement surveys and, for supervisors and above, annual individual employee assessments with an emphasis on individual development for each employee.
 
We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees with respect to COVID-19. In April of 2020, we instituted safe distancing practices and additional cleaning procedures for all company offices and facilities, and our offices in Michigan and Ohio were reconfigured to maintain physical distancing. Wherever feasible, we have encouraged employees to work from home. To date, our employees who work in software sales, maintenance and support, and software development continue to work remotely. Our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations.
 
We believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we do not have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees. In addition, as of March 23, 2023, we engaged three independent contractors.

INTELLINETICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
1. Business Organization and Nature of Operations
 
Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc., is a Nevada corporation incorporated in 1997, with two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Intellinetics, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Intellinetics Ohio”), and Graphic Sciences, Inc., a Michigan corporation (“Graphic Sciences”). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became our sole operating subsidiary as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization. On March 2, 2020, we purchased all the outstanding capital stock of Graphic Sciences.
 
Our digital transformation products and services are provided through two reporting segments: Document Management and Document Conversion. Our Document Management segment, which includes the Yellow Folder, LLC (“Yellow Folder”) asset acquisition in April 2022 and the CEO Imaging Systems, Inc. (“CEO Image”) asset acquisition in April 2020, consists primarily of solutions involving our software platform, allowing customers to capture and manage their documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. Our Document Conversion segment, which includes and primarily consists of the Graphic Sciences acquisition, provides assistance to customers as a part of their overall document strategy to convert documents from one medium to another, predominantly paper to digital, including migration to our software solutions, as well as long-term storage and retrieval services. Our solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the people who need them by making those documents easy to find and access, while also being secure and compliant with the customers’ audit requirements. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers.
 
2. Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We have evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of this Form 10-K.
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements accompanying these notes include the accounts of Intellinetics and the accounts of all its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling interest. Under GAAP, consolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. We have two subsidiaries: Intellinetics Ohio and Graphic Sciences. We consider the criteria established under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidations” in the consolidation process. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The impact of inflation, as well as COVID-19, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimated amounts.
 
Significant estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances related to receivables, accounts receivable -unbilled, the recoverability of long-term assets, depreciable lives of property and equipment, purchase price allocations for acquisitions, fair value for goodwill and intangibles, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, estimates of fair value deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Our management monitors these risks and assesses our business and financial risks on a quarterly basis.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
In accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” we follow a five-step model to assess each contract of a sale or service to a customer: identify the legally binding contract, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price, and determine whether revenue will be recognized at a point in time or over time. Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods and services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. In addition, ASC 606 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
 
We categorize revenue as software, software as a service, software maintenance services, professional services, and storage and retrieval services. We earn the majority of our revenue from the sale of professional services, followed by the sale of software maintenance services and software as a service. We apply our revenue recognition policies as required in accordance with ASC 606 based on the facts and circumstances of each category of revenue.
 
a) Sale of software
 
Revenues included in this classification typically include sales of licenses with professional services to new customers, additional software licenses to existing customers, and sales of software with or without services to our resellers (See section j) - Reseller Agreements, below. Our software licenses are functional intellectual property and typically provide customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity as it exists when made available to the customer. We recognize revenue from software licenses at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
 
F-7
---


b) Sale of software as a service
 
Sale of software as a service (“SaaS”) consists of revenues from arrangements that provide customers the use of our software applications, as a service, typically billed on a monthly or annual basis. Advance billings of these services are not recorded to the extent that the term of the arrangement has not commenced and payment has not been received. Revenue on these services is recognized over the contract period.
 
c) Sale of software maintenance services
 
Software maintenance services revenues consist of revenues derived from arrangements that provide post-contract support (“PCS”), including software support and bug fixes, to our software license holders. Advance billings of PCS are not recorded to the extent that the term of the PCS has not commenced and payment has not been received. PCS are considered distinct services. However, these distinct services are considered a single performance obligation consisting of a series of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These revenues are recognized over the term of the maintenance contract.
 
d) Sale of professional services
 
Professional services revenues consist of revenues from document scanning and conversion services, consulting, discovery, training, and advisory services to assist customers with document management needs, as well as repair and maintenance services for customer equipment. We recognize professional services revenue over time as the services are delivered using an input or output method (e.g., labor hours incurred as a percentage of total labor hours budgeted, images scanned, or similar milestones), as appropriate for the contract, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
e) Sale of storage and retrieval services
 
Sale of document storage and retrieval services consist principally of secured warehouse storage of customer documents, which are typically retained for many years, as well as retrieval per agreement terms and certified destruction if desired. We recognize revenue from document storage and retrieval services over the term of the contract for storage and for the retrieval and destructions components, as the services are delivered. Customers are generally billed monthly based upon contractually agreed-upon terms.
 
f) Arrangements with multiple performance obligations
 
In addition to selling software licenses, software as a service, software maintenance services, professional services, and storage and retrieval services on a stand-alone basis, a portion of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation, on a relative basis using its standalone selling price. We determine the standalone selling price based on the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately.
 
 
F-8
---


g) Contract balances
 
When the timing of our delivery of goods or services is different from the timing of payments made by customers, we recognize either a contract asset (performance precedes contractual due date) or a contract liability (customer payment precedes performance). Customers that prepay are represented by deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract assets represent arrangements in which the good or service has been delivered but payment is not yet due. Our contract assets consisted of accounts receivable, unbilled, which are disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets, as well as contract assets which are comprised of employee sales commissions paid in advance of contract periods ending. Our contract liabilities consisted of deferred (unearned) revenue, which is generally related to software as a service or software maintenance contracts. We classify deferred revenue as current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue, which are disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
The following tables present changes in our accounts receivable and contract assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021:
  Schedule of Changes in Contract Assets and Liabilities
   
 | Balance at Beginning of Period | | Addition from acquisition (Note 5) | | | Billings | | Payments Received | Balance at End of Period | 
-----------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------+---+--------+----------+---+-------------------+----------------------------+------------
Year ended December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Accounts receivable | $ | 1,176,059 | | $ | 68,380 | | $ | 14,422,286 | $ | (14,545,641 | ) | $ | 1,121,083
Year ended December 31, 2021 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Accounts receivable | $ | 792,380 | | $ | - | | $ | 11,871,874 | $ | (11,488,195 | ) | $ | 1,176,059


 | Balance at Beginning of Period | | Revenue Recognized in Advance of Billings | | | Billings | | Balance at End of Period | 
------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+---+-----------+----------+---+--------------------------+--
Year ended December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | 
Accounts receivable, unbilled | $ | 444,782 | | $ | 3,776,612 | | $ | (3,624,984 | ) | $ | 596,410
Year ended December 31, 2021 | | | | | | | | | | | 
Accounts receivable, unbilled | $ | 523,522 | | $ | 4,213,550 | | $ | (4,292,290 | ) | $ | 444,782


 | Balance at Beginning of Period | | Commissions Paid | | | Commissions Recognized | | Balance at End of Period | 
-----------------------------+--------------------------------+--------+------------------+---+---------+------------------------+---+--------------------------+--
Year ended December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | 
Contract assets | $ | 78,556 | | $ | 120,966 | | $ | (119,144 | ) | $ | 80,378
Year ended December 31, 2021 | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract assets | $ | 31,283 | | $ | 88,168 | | $ | (40,895 | ) | $ | 78,556

 
h) Deferred revenue
 
Amounts that have been invoiced are recognized in accounts receivable, deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenues typically relate to maintenance and software as a service agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services, and payments received for professional services and license arrangements and software as a service performance obligations that have been deferred until fulfilled under our revenue recognition policy.
 
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price from contracts for which work has not been performed or goods and services have not been delivered. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 97% of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for software as a service and software maintenance contracts with a duration greater than one year was $74,448. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for software as a service and software maintenance contracts with a duration greater than one year was $16,835. This does not include revenue related to performance obligations that are part of a contract whose original expected duration is one year or less.
 
The following table presents changes in our contract liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:
 

 | Balance at Beginning of Period | | Addition from acquisition (Note 4) | | | Billings | | Recognized Revenue | Balance at End of Period | 
---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------+---+---------+----------+---+--------------------+--------------------------+-----------
Year ended December 31, 2022 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract liabilities: Deferred revenue | $ | 1,194,649 | | $ | 860,456 | | $ | 7,107,625 | $ | (6,408,666 | ) | $ | 2,754,064
Year ended December 31, 2021 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract liabilities: Deferred revenue | $ | 996,131 | | $ | - | | $ | 3,700,828 | $ | (3,502,310 | ) | $ | 1,194,649



i) Rights of return and customer acceptance
 
We do not generally offer variable consideration, financing components, rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions, product rotation, or price protection and, therefore, does not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives. Our contracts with customers generally do not include customer acceptance clauses.
 
j) Reseller agreements
 
We execute certain sales contracts through resellers. We recognize revenues relating to sales through resellers when all the recognition criteria have been met including passing of control. In addition, we assess the credit-worthiness of each reseller, and if the reseller is undercapitalized or in financial difficulty, any revenues expected to emanate from such resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
 
F-9
---


k) Contract costs
 
We capitalize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We have determined that certain sales commissions meet the requirement to be capitalized, and we amortize these costs on a consistent basis with the pattern of transfer of the goods and services in the contract. Total capitalized costs to obtain contracts are included in contract assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
 
l) Sales taxes
 
Sales taxes charged to and collected from customers as part of our sales transactions are excluded from revenues, as well as the determination of transaction price for contracts with multiple performance obligations, and recorded as a liability to the applicable governmental taxing authority.
 
m) Disaggregation of revenue
 
We provide disaggregation of revenue based on product groupings in our consolidated statements of operations as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenues from contracts are primarily within the United States. International revenues were not material to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
 
n) Significant financing component
 
Our customers typically do not pay in advance for goods or services to be transferred in excess of one year. As such, it is not necessary to determine if we benefit from the time value of money and should record a component of interest income related to the upfront payment due to the practical expedient of ASC 606-10-32-18.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
 
We maintain our cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, our cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.
 
The number of customers that comprise our customer base, along with the different industries, governmental entities and geographic regions, in which our customers operate, limits concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable, with the exception of the State of Michigan. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our sales to the State of Michigan totaled approximately 38% and 47% of revenues, respectively. We have not experienced any losses resulting from nonpayment by the State of Michigan.
 
We do not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables; however, we may require customers to provide retainers, up-front deposits or irrevocable letters-of-credit when considered necessary to mitigate credit risks. We have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon facts surrounding the credit risk of specific customers and past collections history. Credit losses have been within management’s expectations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $88,331 and $48,783, respectively.
 
Parts and Supplies
 
Parts and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs are determined using the first-in, first-out method. Parts and supplies are used for scanning and document conversion services. A provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving parts and supplies inventory is made based on parts and supplies levels, future sales forecasted and management’s judgment of potentially obsolete parts and supplies. We recorded an allowance of $24,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

----

Property and Equipment
 
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related assets on a straight-line basis. Furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and purchased software are depreciated over three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter, generally seven to ten years. Upon retirement or other disposition of these assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of these assets are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in the results of operations.
Intangible Assets
 
All intangible assets have finite lives and are stated at cost, net of amortization. Amortization is computed over the useful life of the related assets on a straight-line method.
Goodwill
 
The carrying value of goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually as of December 31, as well as on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recorded fair value.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
We account for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” We test long-lived assets or asset groups, such as property and equipment, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
 
Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.
 
Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value, which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group. There was no impairment of long lived assets in the twelve month periods ended 2022 or 2021.

Purchase Accounting Related Fair Value Measurements
 
We allocate the purchase price, including contingent consideration, of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, with the exception of acquired contract assets and contract liabilities, which are measured under ASC 606. Such fair market value assessments are primarily based on third-party valuations using assumptions developed by management that require significant judgments and estimates that can change materially as additional information becomes available. The purchase price allocated to intangibles is based on unobservable factors, including but not limited to, projected revenues, expenses, customer attrition rates, a weighted average cost of capital, among others. The weighted average cost of capital uses a market participant’s cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. The approach to valuing the initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses similar unobservable factors such as projected revenues and expenses over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the period over which the initial contingent consideration is measured, and volatility rates. We finalize the purchase price allocation once certain initial accounting valuation estimates are finalized, and no later than 12 months following the acquisition date.
Leases
 
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases in which we are the lessee are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases in which we are the lessee are included in finance lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and finance lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We do not have any leases for which we are the lessor.
 
ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and reduced by lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We account for stock-based payments in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires that such equity instruments be measured at their fair values on the grant date. Stock-based payments to employees include grants of stock that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant.
 
The grant date fair value of stock option awards is recognized in earnings as stock-based compensation cost over the requisite service period of the award using the straight-line attribution method. We estimate the fair value of the stock option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The exercise price of options is specified in the stock option agreements. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock for the previous period equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted is based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based upon a U.S. Treasury instrument with a life that is similar to the expected term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based upon the yield expected on date of grant to occur over the term of the option.
 
Software Development Costs
 
We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products. We continuously monitor our software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. In accordance with ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,” we expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Once technological feasibility has been established, certain software development costs incurred during the application development stage are eligible for capitalization. Based on our software development process, technical feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. Such costs in the amount of $43,771 were capitalized during the 2022. No such costs were capitalized during 2021.
 
In accordance with ASC 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” we capitalize purchase and implementation costs of internal use software. Once an application has reached development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable that the expenditure will result in additional functionality. Such costs in the amount of $376,345 were capitalized during 2022. Such costs in the amount of $38,305 were capitalized during 2021.
 
Capitalized costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related assets on a straight-line basis, which is three years. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated balance sheets included $402,673 and $38,305, respectively, in other long-term assets.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, our expensed software development costs were $253,797 and $345,697, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASC 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
 
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a prospective basis during the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the purchase price allocation for the Yellow Folder acquisition (see Note 4).
 
No other Accounting Standards Updates that have been issued but are not yet effective are expected to have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements.
 
Advertising
 
We expense the cost of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $25,830 and $10,237, respectively.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share exclude all diluted potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive, including warrants or options which are out-of-the-money and for those periods with a net loss. The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 reported net income.
Income Taxes
 
We file a consolidated federal income tax return with our subsidiaries. The provision for income taxes is computed by applying statutory rates to income before taxes.
 
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as of each period-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A 100% valuation allowance has been established on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income.
 
We account for uncertainty in income taxes in our financial statements as required under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” The standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition accounting. Management determined there were no material uncertain positions taken by us in our tax returns.

Segment Information
 
Operating segments are defined in the criteria established under ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. Our CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: Document Management and Document Conversion. These segments contain individual business components that have been combined on the basis of common management, customers, solutions offered, service processes and other economic characteristics. We currently have immaterial intersegment sales. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profits. 
The Document Management Segment provides cloud-based and premise-based content services software. Its modular suite of solutions complements existing operating and accounting systems to serve a mission-critical role for organizations to make content secure, compliant, and process-ready. This segment conducts its primary operations in the United States. Markets served include highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive markets in healthcare, K-12 education, public safety, other public sector, risk management, financial services, and others. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers.
 
The Document Conversion Segment provides services for scanning and indexing, converting images from paper to digital, paper to microfilm, and microfiche to microfilm, as well as long-term physical document storage and retrieval. This segment conducts its primary operations in the United States. Markets served include businesses and federal, county, and municipal governments. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through a reseller distributor.

4. Business Acquisitions
 
On April 1, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Yellow Folder. The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with GAAP and was made to expand our market share in the digital transformation industry and due to synergies of product lines and services between the Companies.
 
The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisitions as follows:
  Schedule of Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
 
Assets acquired: | | 
Accounts receivable | $ | 68,380 
Prepaid expenses | | 38,913 
Property and equipment | | 30,018 
Intangible assets (see Note 5) | | 3,888,000
Assets | | 4,025,311
Liabilities assumed: | | 
Accounts payable | | 36,446 
Deferred revenue | | 1,072,530
Liabilities | | 1,108,976
Total identifiable net assets | | 2,916,335
Purchase price | | 6,383,269
Goodwill - Excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired | $ | 3,466,934

 
The purchase price of $6,383,269 was paid in cash. Goodwill in the amount of $3,466,934 was recognized in the acquisition of Yellow Folder and is attributable to the cash flows of the business derived from our potential to outperform the market due to its existing relationship and other synergies created within the Company.
 
Acquisition costs which include legal and other professional fees of $355,281 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were expensed as nonrecurring transaction costs and are included in transaction costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
 
The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the consolidated results of operations for the Company as if the acquisition of Yellow Folder had occurred on January 1, 2021.
  Schedule of Pro Forma Information
 
 | For the twelve months ended |

6. Fair Value Measurements
 
Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.

F-16
----


The carrying values of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of its short maturity. Management believes that the carrying value of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes approximate fair value given that, while there has been change in the overall economic environment, including a significant increase in interest rates, there has not been significant net availability of credit to the Company.
 
We have earnout liabilities related to our two 2020 acquisitions which are measured on a recurring basis and recorded at fair value, measured using probability-weighted analysis and discounted using a rate that appropriately captures the risks associated with the obligation. The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the earnout liabilities are considered to be Level 3 inputs due to the lack of relevant market activity and significant management judgment. Key unobservable inputs include revenue growth rates, which ranged from 0% to 7%, and volatility rates, which were 20% for gross profits. An increase in future revenues and gross profits may result in a higher estimated fair value while a decrease in future revenues and gross profits may result in a lower estimated fair value of the earnout liabilities. 
 
The following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the earnout liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:
  Summary of Changes in Fair Value of Earnout Liabilities
 
 | Year ended December 31, 2022 | 
--------------------------------+------------------------------+-----------
Fair value at January 1, 2022 | $ | 1,630,681 |

2022 Unrelated Notes
 
On April 1, 2022, we sold $2,364,500 in 12% Subordinated Notes (“2022 Unrelated Notes”) to unrelated accredited investors. The entire outstanding principal and unpaid interest of the 2022 Notes are due and payable on March 30, 2025. Interest on the 2022 Unrelated Notes accrues at the rate of 12% per annum, payable quarterly in cash, beginning on September 30, 2022. Any accrued but unpaid quarterly installment of interest will accrue interest at the rate of 14.0% per annum. Any overdue principal and accrued and unpaid interest at the maturity date will accrue a mandatory default penalty of 20% of the outstanding principal balance and an interest rate of 14% per annum from the maturity date until paid in full. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement offering to finance the acquisition of Yellow Folder and the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
2020 Notes
 
On March 2, 2020, we sold 2,000 units, at an offering price of $1,000 per unit, to accredited investors in a private placement offering, with each unit consisting of $1,000 in 12% Subordinated Notes (“2020 Notes”) and 40 shares of our common stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,000,000. The entire outstanding principal and unpaid interest of the 2020 Notes were initially due and payable on February 28, 2023. On December 1, 2022, we paid the note holders an amount totaling $1,019,550 as a prepayment of principal. In December 2022, a majority of the note holders signed an amendment to extend the maturity date for $717,500 of the remaining $980,450 in 2020 Notes to August 31, 2023. Interest on the 2020 Notes accrues at the rate of 12% per annum, payable quarterly in cash, beginning on June 30, 2021. Any accrued but unpaid quarterly installment of interest will accrue interest at the rate of 14.0% per annum. Any overdue principal and accrued and unpaid interest at the maturity date will accrue a mandatory default penalty of 20% of the outstanding principal balance and an interest rate of 14% per annum from the maturity date until paid in full. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement offering to finance the acquisitions of Graphic Sciences and CEO Image and the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We recognized a debt discount of $320,000 for the 80,000 shares issued in conjunction with the units. The amortization of the debt discount, which will be recognized over the life of the 2020 Notes as interest expense, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $102,400 and $106,666, respectively.

Interest on the 2022 Related Note accrues at the rate of 12% per annum, payable quarterly in cash, beginning on September 30, 2022. Any accrued but unpaid quarterly installment of interest will accrue interest at the rate of 14.0% per annum. Any overdue principal and accrued and unpaid interest at the maturity date will accrue a mandatory default penalty of 20% of the outstanding principal balance and an interest rate of 14% per annum from the maturity date until paid in full. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement offering to finance the acquisition of Yellow Folder and the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Pursuant to an employment agreement, we have accrued incentive compensation totaling $0 and $100,828 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for one of our founders.

11. Commitments and Contingencies
 
From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation related to employee claims, contractual disputes and taxes in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the outcome of such matters, currently we have no reason to believe the disposition of any current matter could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or the ability to carry on any of our business activities.
Employment Agreements
 
We have entered into employment agreements with three of our key executives, including one of our founders. Under their respective employment agreements, the executives are employed on an “at-will” basis and are bound by typical confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions.
 Leases
   On January 1, 2010, we entered into an agreement to lease 6,000 rentable square feet of office space in Columbus, Ohio, used for our corporate headquarters, Document Conversion operations, and a small portion of our Document Management operations. The lease commenced on January 1, 2010 and, pursuant to a lease extension dated September 18, 2021, the lease expires on December 31, 2028. The monthly rental payment is $4,950, with gradually higher annual increases each January up to $5,850 for the final year.
 
We lease 36,000 square feet of space in Madison Heights, Michigan as the main facility for our Document Conversion operations. 20,000 square feet is used for records storage services, with the remainder of the space used for production, sales, and administration. The monthly rental payment is $43,185, with gradually higher annual increases each September up to $45,828 for the final year, and with a lease term continuing until August 31, 2026.
 
We also lease a separate 37,000 square foot building in Sterling Heights, Michigan for our Document Conversion operations, with most of the space used for document storage, except approximately 5,000 square feet, which is used for production. The monthly rental payment is $21,072, with gradually higher annual increases each May up to $24,171 for the final year, and with a lease term continuing to April 30, 2028.
 
We lease office space in Traverse City, Michigan for Document Conversion production. The monthly rental payment is $4,500, with a lease term continuing until January 31, 2024.
 
We also lease and use vehicles for logistics pertaining to our Document Conversion segment, primarily pickup and delivery of client materials, including storage and retrieval operations. The monthly rental payments for these vehicles total $4,789, with lease terms continuing until September 30, 2028.
 
We also lease and use an additional temporary office space in Madison Heights for our Document Conversion operations, with a monthly rental payment of $1,605 and a lease term on a month-to-month basis. We have made an accounting policy election to not record a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases, which are defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Instead, the lease payments are recognized as rent expense in the general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations.
 
For each of the above listed leases, management has determined it will utilize the base rental period and have not considered any renewal periods.
   
The following table sets forth the future minimum lease payments under our leases:
