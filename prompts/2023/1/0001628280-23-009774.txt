BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Rockwell Medical is a healthcare company that develops, manufactures, commercializes, and distributes a portfolio of hemodialysis products for dialysis providers worldwide. 
Rockwell is a revenue-generating business and the second largest supplier of acid and bicarbonate concentrates for dialysis patients in the United States. Hemodialysis is the most common form of end-stage kidney disease treatment and is usually performed at freestanding outpatient dialysis centers, at hospital-based outpatient centers, at skilled nursing facilities, or in a patient’s home. This represents a large market opportunity for which Rockwell's products are well-positioned to meet the needs of patients. 
Rockwell manufactures hemodialysis concentrates under Current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") regulations at its three facilities in Michigan, Texas, and South Carolina totaling approximately 175,000 square feet, and manufactures dry acid concentrate mixers at its facility in Iowa. Rockwell delivers the majority of its hemodialysis concentrates products and mixers to dialysis clinics throughout the United States and internationally utilizing its own delivery trucks and third-party carriers. Rockwell has developed a core expertise in manufacturing and delivering hemodialysis concentrates, and has built a longstanding reputation for reliability, quality, and excellent customer service.
In addition to its primary focus on hemodialysis concentrates, Rockwell also has a proprietary parenteral iron product, Triferic® (ferric pyrophosphate citrate ("FPC")), which is indicated to maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. While Rockwell has discontinued commercialization of Triferic in the United States, the Company has established several international partnerships with companies seeking to develop and commercialize Triferic outside the United States and is working closely with these international partners to develop and commercialize Triferic in their respective regions. Additionally, Rockwell continues to evaluate the viability of its FPC platform and FPC's potential to treat iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and in different therapeutic settings.
Rockwell was incorporated in the state of Michigan in 1996 and re-domiciled to the state of Delaware in 2019. Our headquarters is located at 30142 Wixom Road, Wixom, Michigan 48393. Our telephone number is (248) 960-9009 and our website is https://www.rockwellmed.com.

OUR STRATEGY
Rockwell Medical is focused on innovative, long-term growth strategies that enhance its products, its processes, and its people, enabling the Company to deliver exceptional value to the healthcare system and provide a positive impact on the lives of hemodialysis patients. 
Rockwell’s strategy is focused on growing the Company's revenue-generating business, which currently includes its hemodialysis concentrates and international partnerships for Triferic, pausing further investment in capital-intensive pharmaceutical development programs, and achieving profitability to put the Company in a stronger and more stable financial position. 
Once the Company achieves profitability and sustains cash flow from its revenue-generating businesses, it will then consider investments in higher-value, longer-term products to develop a broader kidney care products portfolio. 
HEMODIALYSIS CONCENTRATES
Rockwell's mission is to provide dialysis clinics and the patients they serve with the highest quality products supported by the best customer service in the industry.
Hemodialysis is the most common form of end-stage kidney disease treatment and is usually performed at freestanding outpatient dialysis centers, at hospital-based outpatient centers, at skilled nursing facilities, or in a patient’s home. Our hemodialysis concentrates products are used to sustain a patient's life by removing toxins and balancing electrolytes in a dialysis patient’s bloodstream. 
Rockwell's products are vital to vulnerable patients with end-stage kidney disease. We are an established leader in manufacturing and delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates and dialysates, along with certain ancillary products, to dialysis providers and distributors in the United States and abroad. All of our concentrate products are manufactured according to Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ("AAMI") guidelines and the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP"). Our concentrate products are diluted with purified water on-site at the clinic in the dialysis machine, creating dialysate, which works to clean the patient’s blood.
A key element of our dialysis business strategy going forward is to improve the strength of our concentrates business. We believe we can achieve this by growing our business through the addition of new customers, expanding our territory coverage, increasing the efficiency by which Rockwell produces its products, and pricing our products appropriately to drive profitability.
Our Products: 
Most hemodialysis patients receive dialysis treatment three times per week, or approximately 156 times per year. Most patients who have their dialysis treatment performed at a free-standing clinic have significant and irreversible loss of kidney function. These are commonly referred to as “chronic” dialysis patients. Patients who undergo dialysis in hospitals for temporary loss of kidney function are typically referred to as “acute” dialysis patients. The small percentage of chronic dialysis patients who receives their treatment at home are referred to as “home” dialysis patients. In each setting, a dialysis machine dilutes concentrated solution, such as Rockwell’s concentrate products, with purified water. The resulting solution is called dialysate. Dialysate is pumped through an artificial kidney or filter (called a dialyzer) while the patient’s blood is pumped through a semi-permeable membrane inside the dialyzer in the opposite direction the dialysate is flowing. The dialysate can exchange bicarbonate, sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium into the patient’s blood, while removing fluid and waste. Dialysate generally contains dextrose, sodium chloride, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate, and citric acid or acetic acid. The patient’s physician chooses the proper concentrations required for each patient based on each particular patient’s needs.
In addition to using concentrate products during every in-center treatment, a dialysis provider also uses other products such as blood tubing, fistula needles, dialyzers, drugs, specialized component kits, dressings, cleaning agents, filtration salts, and other supplies, some of which we sell.
CitraPure Citric Acid Concentrate
Our CitraPure Concentrate is citric acid-based, and 100% acetate-free, in contrast to the acetate-based products used for many years. CitraPure has been shown to not promote inflammation associated with acetate-based products and the reduction in inflammation is beneficial to improving patient outcomes. Citrate acts as an anticoagulant and has been shown in clinical studies to reduce the need for heparin during dialysis treatment (CitraPure is not indicated for heparin sparing). CitraPure is packaged as a liquid acid concentrate in 55 gallon drums and one-gallon jugs sold in cases of four, and as a dry powder acid concentrate for use with our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer in 25 gallon cases.
Dri-Sate Dry Acid Concentrate
Our Dri-Sate Concentrate is our acetic acid-based product. Dri-Sate is packaged as a dry powder acid concentrate for use with our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer in 25 gallon cases.
RenalPure Liquid Acid Concentrate
Our RenalPure Liquid Concentrate is our acetic acid-based product and is packaged in 55 gallon drums and cases of four one gallon jugs.
Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer
Our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer is designed for our CitraPure and Dri-Sate Dry Acid products and enables the clinic to mix acid concentrate on-site. Clinics using our Dry Acid Concentrate products realize numerous advantages, including lower 
cost per treatment, reduced storage space requirements, reduced number of deliveries and more flexibility in scheduling deliveries, while enabling us to reduce distribution and warehousing costs.
RenalPure and SteriLyte Bicarbonate Concentrate
RenalPure bicarbonate is a dry powder mixed on-site at the clinic and is packaged for bulk and individual treatment and SteriLyte bicarbonate is a liquid packaged in cases of four one-gallon jugs and is used mainly in acute care settings.
Ancillary Products
We offer certain ancillary products to selected customers including cleaning agents, 6% bleach for disinfection, citric acid descale, filtration salts, and other supplies used by hemodialysis providers. 
Market Opportunity:
Rockwell's vision is to become the leading global supplier of hemodialysis concentrates. 
Today, Rockwell is the second largest supplier of acid and bicarbonate concentrates for dialysis patients in the United States. According to an independent research report that Rockwell commissioned from L.E.K. Consulting LLC in 2022, the hemodialysis concentrates market in the United States alone is currently valued at $380 million and is anticipated to grow to approximately $500 million by 2026. This is driven primarily by an increasing number of patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis concentrates represents a large market opportunity for which we believe Rockwell's products are well-positioned to meet the needs of patients. Rockwell is one of only two suppliers that has the manufacturing scalability and transportation infrastructure to service the over 7,200 dialysis clinics in the United States along with select international markets. 
Sales and Marketing:
Prior to the second quarter of 2022, Rockwell's concentrates business operated at a loss. This loss was accelerated due to inflation, which has increased our manufacturing and operating costs. We undertook discussions with our largest customers to renegotiate our existing supply contracts to improve the profitability of this business line. On April 6, 2022, we amended our agreement with our long-time partner, DaVita, a leading provider of kidney care, to enable us to stabilize our concentrates business. The amended agreement provides for changes to pricing, cost share, cost cutting, and joint efforts to improve supply chain. In addition to the amended agreement, DaVita invested $15 million in preferred stock in two equal tranches. The first tranche of $7.5 million was funded on April 7, 2022. The second tranche of $7.5 million was funded on June 16, 2022. We continue to review our entire supply chain to identify opportunities for improvement, prioritizing initiatives that will have the largest impact on long-term efficiency, profitability, and growth.
On November 9, 2022, Rockwell reacquired its distribution rights to its hemodialysis concentrates products from Baxter and agreed to terminate the exclusive distribution agreement dated October 2, 2014. Exclusivity and other provisions associated with the distribution agreement terminated November 9, 2022 and the remaining operational elements of the agreement terminated December 31, 2022. Rockwell agreed to provide certain services to a group of Baxter customers until March 31, 2023. Under the exclusive distribution agreement, Baxter distributed and commercialized Rockwell’s hemodialysis concentrates products in the United States and certain other countries. Rockwell manufactured all hemodialysis concentrates products and provided customer service and order delivery to nearly all U.S. customers. Following the reacquisition of these rights, Rockwell is now able to sell its hemodialysis concentrates products directly to dialysis clinics throughout the United States and around the world. Additionally, Rockwell is now able to independently price its products, eliminate costs associated with manufacturing covenants, improve manufacturing efficiencies and realize the full benefits from those improvements, and develop, in-license, or acquire new products to develop a broader kidney care products portfolio. This is expected to improve Rockwell's overall profitability and set the Company on a positive growth trajectory. 
We also supply dialysis concentrates to distributors serving a number of foreign countries, primarily in the Americas and the Pacific Rim. Nipro Medical Corporation is the primary distributor of our dialysis concentrates in certain countries in Latin America that were not covered under the Distribution Agreement.
Dialysate concentrates accounted for approximately 98.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Approximately 91.1% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were to distributors and customers for use in the United States.
Customers:
We currently operate in one market segment, the hemodialysis market, which involves the manufacture, sale and distribution of hemodialysis products to hemodialysis clinics, including pharmaceutical, dialysis concentrates, dialysis kits and other ancillary products used in the dialysis process.
DaVita, accounted for 46% of our concentrate sales in 2022 and 47% of our concentrate sales in 2021. Our accounts receivable from this customer were $1.9 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In August 2019, we entered into the Products Purchase Agreement with DaVita, with an initial term expiring on December 31, 2023. On April 6, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Products Purchase Agreement under which we agreed to a price increase, effective May 1, 2022, as well as the pass-through of certain costs, determined on a quarterly basis. Certain costs are subject to a cap. Also on April 6, 2022, the Company and DaVita entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), which provided for the issuance by the Company of up to $15 million of preferred stock to DaVita (see "Preferred Stock" section in Note 12 below).
In October 2014, we entered into the Distribution Agreement with Baxter, which was amended in June 2017 and March 2020, pursuant to which Baxter received exclusive distribution rights for our concentrate products in the United States, a commitment by Rockwell to maintain a specified manufacturing capacity for Baxter, a cap upon the net amount of reimbursable transportation expenses and modified extension terms. Our domestic customer contracts for the supply of dialysis concentrate products that permitted assignment to Baxter without consent were assigned to Baxter. As a result, for 2022 and 2021, our direct sales to Baxter aggregated approximately 29% and 26% of sales, respectively, and we had accounts receivable from Baxter of $2.3 million and $3.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As noted above, Rockwell reacquired its distribution rights to its hemodialysis concentrates products from Baxter and terminated the Distribution Agreement.
No other customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales in any of the last three years. Nipro Medical Corporation, accounted for 7% and 8% of our sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
DaVita, the former Baxter customers, and Nipro Medical Corporation are important to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of any significant accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our key customers.
The majority of our international sales in each of the last two years were sales to domestic distributors that were resold to end users outside the United States. Our total international sales, including sales made through domestic distributors for resale outside the United States, aggregated 9% and 10% of our overall sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign sales.
Competition:
In the United States, our principal competitor for concentrate products is Fresenius Medical Care NA (“Fresenius”), a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of dialysis devices, drugs and supplies and operator of dialysis clinics, which has substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do. Fresenius, through its Fresenius Kidney Care division, operates approximately 2,600 clinics and treats approximately 37% of the in-center hemodialysis patients in the United States. Fresenius also manufactures and sells a full range of renal products, including dialysis machines, dialyzers, concentrates, and other supplies used in hemodialysis. Fresenius services clinics owned by others with its products where it commands a market leading position in its key product lines. Fresenius manufactures its concentrate in its own regional manufacturing facilities. Fresenius and Rockwell are the two major dialysis concentrate suppliers in the United States.
Quality Assurance and Control:
We have established a Quality Management System ("QMS") which defines systems and procedures used to assure quality in the design, manufacture, and delivery of our finished device and pharmaceutical products.
We operate under FDA guidelines and place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers. We have established an organizational structure and quality system procedures to ensure our device products are designed and produced to meet product quality requirements and FDA guidelines. The Grapevine, Texas facility is certified to 
ISO 13485:2016. Dialysis products are manufactured and tested using validated equipment and defined process controls to ensure rigorous conformance to specifications. To assure quality and consistency of our dialysis concentrates, analytical testing is performed using validated instrument methods to verify that the chemical properties and microbial limits of each product lot comply with the specifications required by industry standards. Our concentrates are labeled per FDA Unique Device Identifier ("UDI") code requirements to ensure traceability of distributed products. Our quality program activities also include assessments of suppliers of raw materials, packaging components and finished goods, and quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products, assess the effectiveness of our quality systems, and identify areas for improvement.
The raw materials and packaging materials for our hemodialysis concentrates, the components for our hemodialysis kits and the ancillary hemodialysis products we distribute are generally available from several potential suppliers. The raw materials for our concentrate products consist primarily of chemical ingredients which meet or exceed the requirements of United States Pharmacopeia (“USP”). Key raw materials used in our hemodialysis concentrates include USP grade sodium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, dextrose, citric acid, glacial acetic acid, and sodium bicarbonate. Key packaging components include bottles, caps, bags, boxes, and labels. We generally negotiate pricing and approximate material quantities for our chemicals on an annual basis and utilize blanket purchase orders with monthly release schedules to meet our needs for production.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our key suppliers.
Distribution and Delivery Operations:
The majority of our domestic dialysis concentrate products are delivered through our subsidiary, Rockwell Transportation, Inc., which operates a fleet of trucks used to deliver products to our customers. Rockwell distribution and delivery operated under the Distribution Agreement on behalf of Baxter for domestic business. On November 9, 2022, Rockwell reacquired its distribution rights to its hemodialysis concentrates products from Baxter and agreed to terminate the exclusive distribution agreement dated October 2, 2014. Exclusivity and other provisions associated with the distribution agreement terminated November 9, 2022 and the remaining operational elements of the agreement terminated December 31, 2022. Rockwell agreed to provide certain services to a subgroup of Baxter's customers until March 31, 2023.
Triferic®
Our first two branded products from our FPC platform, Triferic® (dialysate) and Triferic® AVNU, are indicated to maintain hemoglobin in patients undergoing hemodialysis. We began commercializing Triferic and Triferic AVNU in the United States in the second half of 2019 and in early 2021, respectively. In addition, Rockwell established six international partnerships to develop and commercialize Triferic in China, India, Korea, Turkey, Peru and Chile.
In 2022, Rockwell undertook a strategic review of Triferic's viability in the United States. Triferic was launched into a very competitive marketplace with well-entrenched products and a lack of consensus regarding unmet medical needs for dialysis patients with anemia. Due to its limited market adoption, unfavorable reimbursement, and absence of interest from other companies to license or acquire Triferic despite Rockwell's significant effort to partner the program, the Company discontinued its NDAs for Triferic and Triferic AVNU in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sustaining Triferic commercially in the United States resulted in a losses to Rockwell annually. The decision to discontinue the NDAs was not made lightly as the Company realizes the direct impact this action had on patients using the products. Triferic and its approved presentations were not discontinued for safety reasons.
International Partnerships:
Rockwell continues to support its partners outside the United States who have exclusive license agreements to develop and commercialize Triferic in China, India, Korea, Turkey, Peru and Chile. Partnering in these regions allows us to better leverage the development, regulatory, commercial presence, and expertise of business partners to increase sales of our products throughout the world. We believe there is still potential opportunity for Triferic internationally and will work diligently to support our partners, which requires minimal financial commitment from Rockwell and provides us with potential for near- and long-term revenue. We continue to pursue international licensing opportunities in other countries and regions.
Quality Assurance and Control
We have established a Quality Management System ("QMS") which defines systems and procedures used to assure quality in the design, manufacture, and delivery of our finished device and pharmaceutical products.
We utilize Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”) to manufacture and package our drug products for sale. These contract manufacturers are FDA registered drug manufacturing establishments. We follow defined procedures to qualify manufacturers of our products and to review and approve all manufactured products to ensure compliance with FDA cGMP regulations. We ensure our CMOs have established robust quality systems and employ validated processes to ensure the quality and compliance of our drug products to their specifications prior to distribution.
We have engaged CMOs for the manufacture and packaging of Triferic. We have one supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) utilized in Triferic and one fill and finish vendor for the liquid formulation of Triferic (dialysate) and Triferic AVNU. New production is generally initiated via purchase orders, though we will evaluate the need for supply agreements based on our forecasted product needs. The lead time to qualify and obtain regulatory approval for an additional CMO could be lengthy. Any material dispute, lack of quality of the product, or loss of any significant drug product supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our key suppliers.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE
FPC for home infusion is Rockwell's follow-up to Triferic and utilizes the FPC platform in the home infusion setting.
In late 2021, Rockwell filed an IND application with the FDA for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients, who are receiving medications in the home infusion setting. During the second quarter 2022, Rockwell provided the FDA with supplemental data to be used in Rockwell’s clinical studies and to clinically support the Company’s IND application for home infusion. The FDA placed this program on Clinical Hold and requested that additional data related to the microbiology and short-term stability of this formulation be provided to support the application. During the third quarter of 2022, Rockwell conducted a microbial challenge and short-term stability study of FPC for Home Infusion, in accordance with FDA guidance, to support the Company’s IND application. Preliminary results from the microbiology and short-term stability study indicated that the program would likely not meet the FDA’s requirements to support the IND application and would require significant capital expenditure and resources to support additional re-formulation work and conduct a Phase 2 study. As a result, Rockwell has put development work associated with FPC for Home Infusion on hold.
Rockwell is also exploring FPC’s impact on the treatment of hospitalized acute heart failure patients, which affects more than one million people in the United States annually. Rockwell conducted a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in 2022 and will determine the path forward for FPC in acute heart failure as the Company works toward profitability.
MATERIAL AGREEMENTS
Distribution Agreement with Baxter
Pursuant to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement dated October 2, 2014 (as amended, the “Distribution Agreement”), Baxter was our exclusive agent for commercializing our hemodialysis concentrate and ancillary products in the United States to clinics other than DaVita and various foreign countries for an initial term of 10 years ending October 2, 2024. We retained sales, marketing and distribution rights for our hemodialysis concentrate products for our international customers and in those countries in which we had an established commercial presence. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Rockwell reacquired its distribution rights to its hemodialysis concentrates products from Baxter and terminated the Distribution Agreement. Rockwell is required to pay Baxter a fee for the reacquisition of its distribution rights. This fee is payable in two equal installments on January 1, 2023 and April 1, 2023.
Following the reacquisition of the distribution rights, Rockwell is now able to sell its hemodialysis concentrates products to dialysis clinics throughout the United States and around the world. Baxter and Rockwell are working closely together to transition customers’ purchases of Rockwell’s hemodialysis concentrates from Baxter to Rockwell.
Products Purchase Agreement with DaVita
In August 2019, we signed a Products Purchase Agreement (the "Products Purchase Agreement") with DaVita. Pursuant to the Products Purchase Agreement, the Company supplies certain DaVita dialysis centers with dialysis acid concentrate (i.e., CitraPure (Liquid and Dry Acid), Dri-Sate Dry Acid or RenalPure Liquid Acid) and bicarbonate (i.e., RenalPure® Bicarbonate Powder or SteriLyte Liquid Bicarbonate) through December 31, 2023 (the “Initial Term”), subject to certain terms and conditions. The Products Purchase Agreement is a fixed price contract that allows for prices increases only under certain conditions and only after following procedures set forth in the Products Purchase Agreement. In addition, the 
Products Purchase Agreement requires us to maintain twenty-one days of inventory for DaVita and contains penalties if we fail to supply DaVita. If, upon expiration of the Initial Term, the parties have not completed an extension or a new purchase agreement, the Purchase Agreement will continue in effect until terminated by either party with 90 days written notice or until the completion of an extension or new purchase agreement. On April 6, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Products Purchase Agreement under which we agreed to a price increase, effective May 1, 2022, as well as the pass-through of certain costs, determined on a quarterly basis. Certain costs are subject to a cap. 
Product License Agreements
We are party to a Licensing Agreement between the Company and Charak, LLC (“Charak”) dated January 7, 2002 (the “2002 Agreement”) that grants the Company exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents and information related to our Triferic products. On October 7, 2018, we entered into a Master Services and IP Agreement (the “Charak MSA”) with Charak and Dr. Ajay Gupta, who is the former Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the Charak MSA, the parties entered into three additional agreements described below related to the license of certain soluble ferric pyrophosphate (“SFP”) intellectual property owned by Charak, as well as the Employment Agreement (defined below). The Charak MSA provided for a payment of $1,000,000 to Dr. Gupta, payable in four quarterly installments of $250,000 each on October 15, 2018, January 15, 2019, April 15, 2019 and July 15, 2019, and reimbursement for certain legal fees incurred in connection with the Charak MSA. As of December 31, 2019, all payments under the Charak MSA were paid.
Pursuant to the Charak MSA, the aforementioned parties entered into an Amendment, dated as of October 7, 2018 (the “Charak Amendment”), to the 2002 Agreement, under which Charak granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license to commercialize SFP for the treatment of patients with renal failure. The Charak Amendment amends the royalty payments due to Charak under the 2002 Agreement such that the Company is liable to pay Charak royalties on net sales by the Company of products developed under the license, which includes the Company’s Triferic product, at a specified rate until December 31, 2021 and thereafter at a reduced rate from January 1, 2022 until February 1, 2034. In addition, the Company is required to pay Charak a percentage of any sublicense income during the term of the agreement, which amount shall not be less than a minimum specified percentage of net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists a valid patent claim, on a country-by-country basis, and not be less than a lower rate of the net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists no valid patent claim, on a country-by-country basis.
Also pursuant to the Charak MSA, the Company and Charak entered into a Commercialization and Technology License Agreement Triferic IV, dated as of October 7, 2018 (the “IV Agreement”), under which Charak granted the Company an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to SFP for the purpose of commercializing certain intravenous-delivered products incorporating SFP for the treatment of iron disorders worldwide for a term that expires on the later of February 1, 2034 or upon the expiration or termination of a valid claim of a licensed patent. The Company is liable to pay Charak royalties on net sales by the Company of products developed under the license at a specified rate until December 31, 2021. From January 1, 2022 until February 1, 2034, the Company is liable to pay Charak a base royalty at a reduced rate on net sales and an additional royalty on net sales while there exists a valid claim of a licensed patent, on a country-by-country basis. The Company shall also pay to Charak a percentage of any sublicense income received during the term of the IV Agreement, which amount shall not be less than a minimum specified percentage of net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists a valid claim, on a country-by-country basis, and no be less than a lower rate of the net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists no valid claim, on a country-by-country basis.
Also pursuant to the Charak MSA, the Company and Charak entered into a Technology License Agreement TPN Triferic, dated as of October 7, 2018 (the “TPN Agreement”), pursuant to which Charak granted the Company an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to SFP for the purpose of commercializing worldwide certain Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) products incorporating SFP. The license grant under the TPN Agreement continues for a term that expires on the later of February 1, 2034 or upon the expiration or termination of a valid claim of a licensed patent. During the term of the TPN Agreement, the Company is liable to pay Charak a base royalty on net sales and an additional royalty on net sales while there exists a valid claim of a licensed patent, on a country-by-country basis. The Company shall also pay to Charak a percentage of any sublicense income received during the term of the TPN Agreement, which amount shall not be less than a minimum royalty on net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists a valid claim, on a country-by-country basis, and not be less than a lower rate of the net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists no valid claim, on a country-by-country basis.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FD&C Act"), as well as by other federal, state and local agencies. We hold several FDA product approvals including for both drugs and medical devices.
The testing, manufacture and sale of our hemodialysis concentrates and the ancillary products we distribute are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. Under the FD&C Act, and FDA regulations, the FDA regulates the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and drugs. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant pre-market clearance or pre-market approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
We have developed and are developing drug candidates utilizing the FPC Platform. The development and regulatory approval process for new drugs and additional indications for approved drugs includes preclinical testing and human clinical trials and is lengthy and uncertain. Before marketing any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product in the United States, the product must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FD&C Act.
Moreover, the FDA imposes substantial requirements on new product research and the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products, including testing and clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of these products.
Medical Device Approval and Regulation
A medical device may be marketed in the United States only with prior authorization from the FDA, unless it is subject to a specific exemption. Most Class I devices (general controls) and some Class II devices (general and special controls) are exempt from the premarket notification (i.e., 510(k) clearance) requirements. Class III devices generally require "premarket approval" (“PMA”) from the FDA as described in further detail below. FDA grants 510(k) clearance when the submitted information establishes that a proposed device is "substantially equivalent" in terms of safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval. A legally marketed device is a “pre-amendment” device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (for which a PMA is not required), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or II, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA in recent years has been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past, including requiring clinical trial data in some cases. For any devices that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or constitute a new or major change in the intended use of the device, will require new 510(k) submissions. It usually takes three to six months from the date of submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, and may take substantially longer. Our hemodialysis concentrates (acid and bicarbonate) and other ancillary products are categorized as Class II devices.
Class III devices typically are devices that sustain or support life, prevent impairment of human health or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. A Class III device generally must receive approval through a PMA application, which requires proving the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA. The process of obtaining PMA approval is expensive and uncertain. It usually takes approximately one year to obtain approval after filing the request, and may take substantially longer.
If human clinical trials of a device are required, whether for a 510(k) submission or a PMA application, and the device presents a “significant risk,” the sponsor of the trial (usually the manufacturer or the distributor of the device) will have to file an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more appropriate Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”), the device may be shipped for the purpose of conducting the investigations without compliance with all of the requirements of the FD&C Act and human clinical trials may begin. The FDA will specify the number of investigational sites and the number of patients that may be included in the investigation. If the device does not present a “significant risk” to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate IRBs without the need for FDA approval.
Any devices manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. As a manufacturer of medical devices for marketing in the United States, we are required to adhere to regulations, including 21 CFR 820, which is commonly referred to as the Quality System Regulation, setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, which include testing, control and documentation requirements. We must also comply with medical device reporting regulations which require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our products 
may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Under such a scenario, our products may be subject to voluntary recall by us or required recall by the FDA. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FD&C Act prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses.
We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other applicable quality system regulations. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
Our hemodialysis concentrate products and other ancillary devices are subject the FDA 510(k) requirements.
We have 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market hemodialysis concentrates in both liquid and powder form. In addition, we have received 510(k) clearance for our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer.
We must comply with the FD&C Act and related laws and regulations, including cGMP, to retain 510(k) clearances. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our 510(k) clearances from the FDA to manufacture and distribute our products. If we fail to maintain our 510(k) clearances, we may be required to cease manufacturing and/or distributing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of our FDA clearances are denied or rescinded, sales of our products in the United States would be prohibited during the period we do not have such clearances.
Drug Approval and Regulation
The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States, such as Triferic, requires the approval of the FDA. The FDA has established regulations, guidelines and safety standards which apply to the pre‑clinical evaluation, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our new iron maintenance therapy product and other pharmaceutical products. The steps required before a pharmaceutical product can be produced and marketed for human use include: (i) pre‑clinical studies; (ii) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence in the United States; (iii) adequate and well controlled human clinical trials; (iv) submission to the FDA of an NDA; and (v) review and approval of the NDA by the FDA. An NDA generally is required for products with new active ingredients, indications, routes of administration, dosage forms or strengths. An NDA requires that complete clinical studies of a product’s safety and efficacy be submitted to the FDA, the cost of which is substantial. The costs are often less, however, for new delivery systems, which utilize already approved drugs than for drugs with new active ingredients.
Pre‑clinical studies are conducted to obtain preliminary information on a pharmaceutical product’s efficacy and safety in animal or in vitro models. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before human clinical trials begin. Human clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA unless the FDA objects to the commencement of clinical trials.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing the product primarily for safety, metabolism and pharmacologic action in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers at one or more doses. In Phase 2 trials, the safety and efficacy of the product are evaluated in a patient population somewhat larger than the Phase 1 trials with the primary intent of determining the effective dose range. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at a large number of test sites. A clinical plan, or protocol, accompanied by documentation from the institutions participating in the trials, must be received by the FDA prior to commencement of each of the clinical trials. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
The results of product development and pre‑clinical and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA for approval. If an application is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will review and approve the NDA in a timely manner. The FDA may refuse to file an NDA if it is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may deny an NDA by way of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional testing, including pre‑clinical, clinical and or product manufacturing tests. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately deny approval of the product. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling, or a change in a manufacturing facility, an NDA supplement may be required to be submitted to the FDA. Product approvals may be withdrawn after the product reaches the market if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur regarding the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA may require testing and 
surveillance programs to monitor the effect of products which have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of these products based on the results of these post‑marketing programs.
Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with regulations, such as cGMP requirements, and each domestic drug manufacturing facility must be registered with the FDA. Foreign regulatory authorities may also have similar regulations. We expend significant time, money and effort in the area of quality assurance to comply with all applicable requirements. FDA approval to manufacture a drug is site specific. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug becomes inoperable, obtaining the required FDA approval to manufacture such drug at a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Manufacturers and distributors must comply with various post‑market requirements, including adverse event reporting, re‑evaluation of approval decisions and notices of changes in the product or in the process or procedures used to manufacture a product.
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to certain post-approval requirements. NDA applicants are required to submit to FDA information about any adverse event associated with the use of an approved drug, whether or not the adverse event is considered drug related. If a marketed drug is found to be potentially harmful or does not comply with applicable requirements, the manufacturer may recall the product. The FDA regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Major changes and some moderate changes to an approved drug, or to the conditions established in the approved NDA, may require the submission and approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. Other changes may be made at the time of FDA’s receipt of the NDA supplement or may be described in our next annual report for the approved NDA.
Pediatric Requirements
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA"), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication where orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of the marketing exclusivity or patent protection for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Other Government Regulations
The federal and state governments in the United States, as well as many foreign governments, from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation, we cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical and medical device industry or on our business or operating results. Our activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, and environmental protection and may be subject to other present and possible future local, state, federal and foreign regulations. We do not expect that compliance with these regulations, including environmental laws, will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which for the first time authorizes Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") to negotiate Medicare reimbursement rates for certain high-cost prescription drug products, which may put limits on prices paid for drugs by government health programs. Additionally, the IRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if their drug prices increase faster than the rate of inflation. Effective in 2024, another provision will also eliminate 5% coinsurance for catastrophic coverage under Medicare Part D; while in 2025, the IRA will cap beneficiary annual out-of-pocket expenditure at $2,000 USD. These efforts to reduce aggregate beneficiary spending are expected to shift some costs to drug manufacturers.
Other restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following:
•the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, which prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services payable by Medicare to an entity with which he or she (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship, and prohibits the entity from presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare for those referred services;
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, where one purpose is to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of, any item or services for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of medical device manufacturers;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA;
•the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;
•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires certain applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under certain federal healthcare programs, to monitor and report to CMS, certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors); certain other healthcare providers, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals; as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
•U.S. federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities that potentially harm customers; and
•state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to item or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws requiring device companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict payments made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
The approval procedures for the marketing of our products in foreign countries vary from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We generally depend on our foreign distributors or marketing partners to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to market our products in those countries, which may or may not require additional testing for products that have received FDA approval.
However, since medical practice and governmental regulations differ across regions, further testing may be needed to support market introduction in some foreign countries. Some foreign regulatory agencies may require additional studies involving patients located in their countries. Even after foreign approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before products may be marketed. Issues related to import and export can delay product introduction. Many countries require additional governmental approval for price reimbursement under national health insurance systems.
