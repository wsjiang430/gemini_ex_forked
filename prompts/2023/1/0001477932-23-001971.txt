BUSINESS

Overview 

The Company's business model includes licensing operations, processing operations, processing facilities, sale of products, brand creation, technology development, and consulting services relating to the marijuana industry. Ultimately, our intent is to become a low-cost branded cannabis company. 

We were originally incorporated as Dujour Products, Inc. on May 15, 2004, in the State of Nevada. Most recently we operated under the name Holloman Energy Corporation. On May 1, 2020, we sold 1,000,000 shares of its Series A preferred stock to Magenta Value Holdings LLC. The Series A preferred shares have the right to cast 90% of the total votes with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration. After Magenta Value Holdings LLC acquired its preferred shares of the Company, Gina Serkasevich, the CFO of Holloman Energy Corporation was appointed to CEO, Treasurer, and Director. Subsequently, the Company adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing its name to Hero Technologies Inc. In a related transaction, Holloman Value Holdings sold approximately $2,245,000 of debt owed to it by the Company to P2B Capital LLC.

On November 6, 2020, the Company acquired highlyrelaxing.com and subsequently formed Highly Relaxing LLC, an emerging Cannabidiol (“CBD”) therapeutic company located in Denver, CO that provides topical agents and other creams and products. As of December 31, 2022 Highly Relaxing has not generated revenue for the Company. 

On September 10, 2020, the Company formed Blackbox Technologies and Systems LLC. Blackbox Technologies and Systems LLC has been renamed Blackbox Systems and Technologies LLC. Blackbox has applied to the state of Michigan for marijuana licenses, and received step 1 approvals in adult-use and medicinal use. Full licenses if granted, will allow Blackbox to cultivate cannabis in the state of Michigan. If the licenses are granted, Blackbox plans to construct four greenhouses and ----four hoop houses at a cost of approximately $9 million. The greenhouses will grow large cannabis flowering plants based on aeroponic technology. Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. The Company has a 51% interest in Blackbox. Although the total cost of the project is estimated at $9 million, there are alternative options that will allow the Company to proceed with the project at a lower cost. For example, the lowest cost option, the hoop houses, require a total cost of only $501,196. Below is a table depicting the various options and the estimated number of shares that need to be sold in our public offering to fund each option:


Name of the Option: | Total Cost: | | Projected Revenue (assuming $3,200/lbs.): | | Number of shares that must be sold to fund the project:
------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
Hoop houses | $ | 501,196 | | 2lb/plant: $1,536,0006lb/plant: $4,608,000 | | 31,023,920

Blackbox is currently seeking two Michigan marijuana licenses, one for adult use and one for medicinal use. Specifically, Blackbox is in the process of pursuing a Class C license, which would permit them to cultivate up to 2,000 marijuana plants for adult use and 1,500 plants for medicinal use. In order to obtain such a license, Blackbox is required to pay an initial fee of $40,000 for each license. Further, Blackbox is required to pay a renewal fee for every year that they wish to retain their license. The fee for renewing a marijuana license can range from $30,000 to $50,000, depending on the total weight of the marijuana plants that were cultivated for the preceding year.

At present, Blackbox has satisfied the criteria for Step 1 Prequalification approval for a Class C medicinal-use cannabis license in Michigan. Similarly, Blackbox has also satisfied the criteria for a Step 1 Prequalification approval for a Class C adult-use Cannabis License. To earn a Step 1 Prequalification approval for both licenses, BlackBox had to provide detailed information to the MRA on its sources of capitalization, corporate officers, directors, major shareholders, insurance compliance, financial statements attested to by a certified public accountant, and undergo extensive background checks.

Blackbox has now begun the process for Step 2, which includes approval for a new medical marijuana facility that is being built in Pulaski, Michigan. Further, the company has obtained approval from the Township of Pulaski for three Class C Medicinal Use Cannabis Licenses conditioned on completing Step 2 with the Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency ("MRA"). In order to obtain Pulaski's approval, Blackbox had to provide site specific information, advise Pulaski of its facility construction documents, business plan, security arrangements, sanitation plan, and revenue projections. Final approval and licensing for both medicinal and adult-use licenses will occur upon completion of the Pulaski greenhouses, obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy, and a final MRA inspection. Project costs for development of the Pulaski property are now estimated at approximately $8.94 million. The company does not have the ability to fully fund the project; however, the company is diligently working to obtain the necessary financing to move forward with the project. Once the greenhouse facility is constructed, the company will submit a Step 2 application, which entails having the newly constructed facility inspected by the Bureau of Fire Services within 60 days after the Step 2 application is submitted. Failure to pass an inspection by the BFS within 60 days may result in the denial of the license. Blackbox is also required, by the MRA, to disclose the sources and total amount of capitalization that is required to operate and maintain a proposed marijuana facility. For a Class C license, Blackbox is required to show that they have $500,000 available to operate and maintain the facility. Completing the Step 2 process will allow the company to proceed with the cultivation of cannabis in Michigan.

Competition

We face extreme competition from both larger, better-financed national brands as well as an ever-increasing number of boutique service providers in the cannabis industry. We currently track sixty-nine (69) such providers in this space and are continually monitoring their progress and presence in the industry while working to continue to demonstrate our unique licensing offering. We also track eighty-eight (88) public companies that are either directly in or loosely involved in the cannabis industry.
Regulatory Considerations

Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws.

As of the date of this Prospectus 36 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 15 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Biden Administration, if it follows Obama Administration policies, is not likely to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the Administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the Federal Government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. 

The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:


· | the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana; 
· | the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states; 
· | state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
· | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
· | the growing of marijuana on public lands; and 
· | marijuana possession or use on federal property. 


Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business.

Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most banks will not accept, for deposit, funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate.
