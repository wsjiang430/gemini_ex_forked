Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW

FreightCar America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“FCA”) and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refers to FCA and its subsidiaries) are a diversified manufacturer of railcars and railcar components. We design and manufacture a broad variety of railcar types for transportation of bulk commodities and containerized freight products primarily in North America, including open top hoppers, covered hoppers, and gondolas along with intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars. We and our predecessors have been manufacturing railcars since 1901. Over the last several years, we have introduced a number of new or redesigned railcar types as we continue to diversify our product portfolio.

During 2019, we entered into a joint venture arrangement with Fabricaciones y Servicios de México, S.A. de C.V. (“Fasemex”), a Mexican company with operations in both Mexico and the United States, to manufacture railcars in Castaños, Coahuila, Mexico (“Castaños”), in exchange for a 50% interest in the operation. Production of railcars at the facility began during the third quarter of 2020. On October 16, 2020, we acquired Fasemex’s 50% ownership in the joint venture. As of March 2021, we moved all of our production to the Castaños facility.

We ceased operations at our Roanoke, Virginia manufacturing facility (the “Roanoke Facility”) and vacated the facility as of March 31, 2020. On September 10, 2020, we announced our plan to permanently close our manufacturing facility in Cherokee, Alabama (the “Shoals Facility”) in light of the cyclical industry downturn, which was magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure reduced costs and aligned our manufacturing capacity with the current railcar market. We ceased production at the Shoals Facility in February 2021.

We lease freight cars through our leasing entities, including JAIX Leasing Company, and FreightCar America Leasing 1, LLC. Although we continually look for opportunities to package our leased assets for sale to our leasing company partners, these leased assets may not be converted to sales, and may remain revenue producing assets into the foreseeable future. We also rebuild and convert railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others.

Our primary customers are shippers, railroads, and financial institutions which represented 38%, 36% and 22%, respectively, of our total sales attributable to each type of customer for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we delivered 3,184 railcars, including 2,281 new railcars and 903 rebuilt railcars, compared to 1,731 railcars, including 1,354 new railcars and 377 rebuilt railcars, delivered in the year ended December 31, 2021. Our total backlog of firm orders for railcars increased from 2,323 railcars as of December 31, 2021 to 2,445 railcars as of December 31, 2022. Our backlog as of December 31, 2022 includes a variety of railcar types and the estimated sales value of the backlog is $288 million.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We design and manufacture a broad variety of freight cars including covered hoppers, open top hoppers, gondolas, intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars that transport numerous types of dry bulk and containerized freight products.
 
In the last seven years, we have added 22 new or redesigned products to our portfolio, including various covered hopper car products with cubic capacities from 3,282 cubic foot to 6,250 cubic foot; 52’ and 66’ mill gondolas; (longitudinal trough and 5, 7, 9, and 10 transverse trough) coil gondolas; woodchip gondolas; triple hoppers and hybrid aluminum/stainless steel railcars; ore hopper and gondola railcars; ballast hopper cars; aggregate hopper cars (with manual, independent or fully automatic transverse or longitudinal door systems); intermodal flats (including the 3-unit, 53-foot well cars) and non-intermodal flat cars (including slab, hot slab and bulkhead flats). Focused product development activity continues in areas where we can leverage our technical knowledge base and capabilities to realize market opportunities.
 
The types of railcars listed below include the major types of railcars that we are capable of manufacturing. We rebuild and convert railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others. Many of

our railcars are produced using a patented one-piece center sill, the main longitudinal structural component of the railcar. In addition to railcars designed for use in North America, we have manufactured railcars for export to Latin America and the Middle East. Railroads outside of North America are constructed with a variety of track gauges that are sized differently than in North America, which requires us, in some cases, to alter our manufacturing specifications accordingly.
 
Any of the railcar types listed below may be further developed to meet the characteristics of the materials being transported and customer specifications.
 
•VersaFlood Hopper Cars. The VersaFlood product series offers versatile design options for transportation of aggregates, sand or minerals. Our VersaFlood series open-top hopper railcars include steel, stainless steel or hybrid steel and aluminum-bodied designs equipped with three-pocket (transverse gate) or two-pocket (longitudinal gate) discharge door systems with manual, independent or fully automatic door operation. 
 
•Covered Hopper Cars. Our covered hopper railcar product offerings encompass a wide range of cubic foot (cf) capacity designs for shipping dry bulk commodities of varying densities including: 3,282 cf covered hopper cars for cement, sand and roofing granules; 4,300 cf covered hopper cars for potash or similar commodities; 5,200 cf, 5,400 cf and 5700 cf covered hopper cars for grain and other agricultural products; and 5,800 cf and 6,250 cf covered hopper cars for plastic pellets.
 
•DynaStack Series. Our intermodal doublestack railcar product offering includes the DynaStack articulated 3-unit, 53’ well cars for transportation of international and domestic containers. 
 
•Steel Products Cars. Our portfolio of railcar types also includes 52’ and 66’ mill gondola railcars used to transport steel products and scrap; slab, hot slab and coil steel railcars designed specifically for transportation of steel slabs and coil steel products, respectively.
 
•Boxcars. Our high capacity boxcar railcar product offerings, featuring inside length of 50’, single plug door and 60’9”, double plug doors, galvanized steel roof panels and nailable steel floors, primarily designed for transporting paper products, paper rolls, lumber and wood products and foodstuffs. 
 
•Aluminum Coal Cars. The BethGon is the leader in the aluminum-bodied coal gondola railcar segment. Since we introduced the steel BethGon railcar in the late 1970s and the aluminum BethGon railcar in 1986, the BethGon railcar has become the most widely used coal car in North America. Our current BethGon II features lighter weight, higher capacity and increased durability suitable for long-haul coal carrying railcar service. We have received several patents on the features of the BethGon II and continue to explore ways to increase the BethGon II’s capacity and reliability.
 
Our aluminum bodied open-top hopper railcar, the AutoFlood, is a five-pocket coal car equipped with a bottom discharge gate mechanism. We began manufacturing AutoFlood railcars in 1984, and introduced the AutoFlood II and AutoFlood III designs in 1996 and 2002, respectively. Both the AutoFlood II and AutoFlood III designs incorporate the automatic rapid discharge system, the MegaFlo door system, a patented mechanism that uses an over-center locking design, enabling the cargo door to close with tension rather than by compression. Further, AutoFlood railcars can be equipped with rotary couplers to permit rotary unloading.
 
•Stainless Steel and Hybrid Stainless Steel/Aluminum Coal Cars. We manufacture a series of stainless steel and hybrid stainless steel and aluminum AutoFlood and BethGon coal cars designed to serve the Eastern railroads. These coal cars are designed to withstand the rigors of Eastern coal transportation service. They offer a unique balance of maximized payload, light weight, efficient unloading and long service life. Our coal car product offerings include aluminum-bodied flat-bottom gondola railcars and steel or stainless steel-bodied triple hopper railcars for coal, metallurgical coke and petroleum coke service.
 

•Other Railcar Types. Our other railcar types include non-intermodal flat railcars and bulkhead flat railcars designed to transport a variety of products, including machinery and equipment, steel and structural steel components (including pipe), wood and forest products and other bulk industrial products; woodchip hopper and gondola railcars designed to haul woodchips and municipal waste or other low-density commodities; and a variety of commodity carrying open top hopper railcars designed to carry ballast, iron ore, taconite pellets and other bulk commodities; the AVC Aluminum Vehicle Carrier design used to transport commercial and light vehicles (automobiles and trucks) from assembly plants and ports to rail distribution centers; and the articulated bulk container railcar designed to carry dense bulk products such as waste products in 20’ containers.
 
•Railcar Conversions. We are a leader in rebuilding and repurposing freight car assets. From complete car rebuilds to transforming unused railcars into the latest designs, we deliver customer-focused solutions. We have completed over 14,000 total conversions and rebuilds in the last decade and offer a broad portfolio of over 20 car conversion options. Our new, purpose-built facility supports a wide variety of conversion options including small cube covered hopper conversions, aluminum body railcar conversions, sand railcar modularized lengthening modification programs and railcar modularized modification programs altering the nature of the center sill in the modified railcar. 
 
MANUFACTURING

Our railcar production facility in Castaños is certified by the Association of American Railroads (the “AAR”), which sets railcar manufacturing industry standards for quality control. Our Castaños manufacturing facility began production during the third quarter of 2020 and provides a solid platform from which to pursue a broad range of commodity carrying railcar business including intermodal well cars, non-intermodal flat cars and various open-top hopper, covered hopper and gondola cars.

Our manufacturing process involves four basic steps: fabrication, assembly, finishing and inspection. Our facility has numerous checkpoints at which we inspect products to maintain quality control, a process that our operations management continuously monitors. In our fabrication processes, we employ standard metal working tools, many of which are computer controlled. Each assembly line typically involves 15 to 20 manufacturing positions, depending on the complexity of the particular railcar design. We use mechanical fastening in the fitting and assembly of our aluminum-bodied railcar parts, while we typically use welding for the assembly of our steel-bodied railcars. For aluminum-bodied railcars, we begin the finishing process by cleaning the railcar’s surface and then applying the decals. In the case of steel-bodied railcars, we begin the finishing process by blasting the surface area of the railcar, painting it and then applying decals. Once we have completed the finishing process, our employees, along with representatives of the customer purchasing the particular railcars, inspect all railcars for adherence to specifications.

CUSTOMERS

We have strong long-term relationships with many large purchasers of railcars. Long-term customer relationships are particularly important in the railcar industry, given the limited number of buyers of railcars.

Our customer base consists mostly of North American shippers, railroads, and financial institutions. We believe that our customers’ preference for reliable, high-quality products, our engineering design expertise, technological leadership in developing and enhancing innovative products and the competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers.

In 2022, revenue from three customers, Union Pacific Railroad, Vulcan Materials Company and Infinity Transportation, accounted for approximately 20%, 19% and 16%, respectively, of total revenue. In 2022, sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 76% of total revenue. In 2021, revenue from three customers, TTX Company, CIT Rail and Union Pacific Railroad, accounted for approximately 46%, 12% and 8%, respectively, of total revenue. In 2021, sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 78% of total revenue. We did not have any railcar sales to customers outside the United States in 2022 and 2021. Many of our customers do not purchase railcars every year because railcar fleets are not necessarily replenished or augmented every year. The size and frequency of railcar orders often results in a small number of customers representing a significant portion of our sales in a given year. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our major customers, the loss of any significant portion of our sales to any major customer, the loss of a single major customer or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


SALES AND MARKETING

Our direct sales group is organized by customer and geography and consists of vice presidents of sales (“VPs”), contract administrators, a manager of customer service, a director of field support, and support staff. The VPs are responsible for developing and closing new business and managing customer relationships. Our contract administrators are responsible for preparing proposals and other inside sales activities. Our director of field support is responsible for after-sale follow-up, technical support, training, and in-field product performance reviews.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We utilize the latest engineering methods, tools and processes to ensure that new products and processes meet our customers’ requirements and are delivered in a timely manner. We develop and introduce new railcar designs as a result of a combination of customer feedback and close observation of developing market trends. We work closely with our customers to understand their expectations and design railcars that meet their needs. New product designs are tested and validated for compliance with AAR standards prior to introduction. This comprehensive approach provides the criteria and direction that ensure we are developing products that our customers desire and perform as expected. Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.
BACKLOG
 
We define backlog as the value of those products or services which our customers have committed in writing to purchase or lease from us when built, but which have not yet been recognized as sales. Our contracts may include cancellation clauses under which customers are required, upon cancellation of the contract, to reimburse us for costs incurred in reliance on an order and in some cases, to compensate us for lost profits. However, customer orders may be subject to customer requests for delays in railcar deliveries, inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions, which could prevent or delay backlog from being converted into sales.

The following table depicts our reported railcar backlog in number of railcars and estimated future sales value attributable to such backlog, for the periods shown.


 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2022 | | | 2021 | 
Railcar backlog at start of period | | 2,323 | | | | 1,389 | 
Net railcar orders received | | 3,306 | | | | 2,665 | 
Railcars delivered | | (3,184 | ) | | | (1,731 | )
Railcar backlog at end of period (1) | | 2,445 | | | | 2,323 | 
Estimated revenue from backlog at end of period (in thousands) (2) | $ | 287,969 | | | $ | 240,160 | 

 

(1)Railcar backlog includes 423 and 605 rebuilt railcars as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 (2)Estimated revenue from backlog reflects the total revenue attributable to the backlog reported at the end of the period as if such backlog were converted to actual sales. Estimated revenue from backlog as of December 31, 2022 includes $40.6 million that is not expected to be converted to sales within one year. Estimated revenue from backlog does not reflect potential price increases and decreases under customer contracts that provide for variable pricing based on changes in the cost of raw materials. Although we continually look for opportunities to package our leased assets for sale to our leasing company partners, these leased assets may not be converted to sales.
 
Although our reported backlog is typically converted to sales within two years, our reported backlog may not be converted to sales in any particular period, if at all, and the actual sales from these contracts may not equal our reported backlog estimates. In addition, due to the large size of railcar orders and variations in the mix of railcars, the size of our reported backlog at the end of any given period may fluctuate significantly.

SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS
 
The cost of raw materials and components represents a substantial majority of the manufacturing costs of most of our railcar product lines. As a result, the management of raw materials and components purchasing is critical to our profitability. We enjoy generally strong relationships with our suppliers, which helps to ensure access to supplies when railcar demand is high.


Our primary aluminum suppliers are Ryerson Metals and Hydro Extrusions. Aluminum prices generally are not fixed at the time a railcar order is accepted due to our infrequent usage and subsequent low volume purchases of aluminum. Our primary steel suppliers are Feralloy Corporation and Reibus International. Steel prices generally are not fixed at the time a railcar order is accepted due to fluctuations in market prices. In 2022 we primarily bought fabrications from local suppliers, with Fasemex being the largest of the local suppliers. In the third quarter of 2022, we initiated the process of opening our fabrication shop at our Castaños Facility. However, we continued to buy fabrications from our local suppliers during this time.

Our primary component suppliers include Wabtec, Amsted, Standard Steel, SKF, and Metalex, who supply us with truck components, brake components, couplers, wheels & axles, bearings, and running boards, respectively. Roll Form Group is the sole supplier of our roll-formed center sills, which were used in 53% and 20% of our new railcars produced in 2022 and 2021, respectively. A center sill is the primary longitudinal structural component of a railcar, which helps the railcar withstand the weight of the cargo and the force of being pulled during transport. Our center sill is formed into its final shape without heating by passing steel plate through a series of rollers.

Other suppliers provide brake systems, castings, bearings and various other components. The railcar industry is periodically subject to supply constraints for some of the key railcar components.

Except as described above, there are usually at least two suppliers for each of our raw materials and specialty components. Our top ten suppliers accounted for 62% and 80% of our total purchases in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

COMPETITION
 
We operate in a highly competitive marketplace especially in periods of low market demand resulting in excess manufacturing capacity and face substantial competition from established competitors in the railcar industry in North America. In addition to price, competition is based on delivery timing, product performance and technological innovation, reputation for product quality and customer service and support.

We have three principal competitors in the North American railcar market that primarily manufacture railcars for third-party customers, which are Trinity Industries, Inc., The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and National Steel Car Limited.

Competition in the North American market from railcar manufacturers located outside of North America is limited by, among other factors, high shipping costs and familiarity with the North American market.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We have several U.S. and international patents and pending applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names. Our key patent includes our hopper railcar with automatic individual door system. The protection of our intellectual property is important to our business.
HUMAN CAPITAL

Employees

As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,435 employees, of which 319 were salaried and 1,116 were hourly wage earners. As of December 31, 2022, 1,381 of our employees were based in Mexico, 52 were based in the U.S. and 2 were based in China. As of December 31, 2021, we had 997 employees, of whom 223 were salaried and 774 were hourly wage earners. As of December 31, 2021, 941 of our employees were based in Mexico, 54 were based in the U.S. and 2 were based in China.
Workforce Talent and Diversity
 
The success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified, and highly skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce, our executive officers and other key personnel.

Our compensation programs are designed to ensure that we attract and retain the right talent. We generally review and consider median market pay levels when assessing total compensation, but pay decisions are based on a more comprehensive set of considerations including company performance, individual performance, experience, and internal equity. We continually monitor key talent metrics including employee engagement and employee turnover. Our employee benefits programs strive to deliver competitive benefits that are effective in attracting and retaining talent, that create a culture of well-being and inclusiveness, and that meet the

diverse needs of our employees. Our total package of benefits is designed to support the physical, mental, and financial health of our employees, and we currently provide access to medical, dental, vision, life insurance and retirement benefits, as well as disability benefits.

Safety

We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. We seek to protect the well-being of our employees through comprehensive health and safety policies and procedures that include the identification and mitigation of health and safety risks, operations management, health and safety training, emergency preparedness, performance auditing, program certification, and improvement targets.
Human Rights
 
We are committed to respecting human rights throughout all our operations, and seek to provide respect, dignity, and all basic needs to employees and contractors. We are committed to promoting human rights and strive to ensure that the products and services provided by the Company and our third-party business partners are ethically sourced and do not breach human rights laws in countries in which they originate.
COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY
 
Consistent with our vision, we are committed to growing our business in a sustainable and socially responsible manner. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of our governance policies in light of recent trends relating to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics and disclosure. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets periodically with senior management to develop, assess and prioritize ESG topics that are important to our business and all of our stockholders and to improve both the measurement and transparency of our ESG disclosures and practices. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has primary oversight responsibility for our developing ESG efforts.
Environmental Stewardship
 
We are committed to contributing to a more resource-efficient economy and embedding climate change mitigation into our business strategy to help confront challenges such as energy management, fuel economy and efficiency, and materials sourcing. We aim to operate our business in a manner that minimizes the impact on natural resources and the environment. For decades, FCA has been a leader in introducing lighter weight freight car designs that require less energy to manufacture and offer higher capacity than the freight cars they replace. Our offering of “conversion” railcars, eliminates underutilized and older inefficient railcar assets by scraping the car body and reusing key steel and cast components. The scrap materials are used to support a more environmentally friendly steel manufacturing process and the reuse of key components including wheels and castings results in reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We believe railcars are a more environmentally-friendly way than other modes of transportation to fuel the North American supply chain. Railroads produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than certain other modes of commercial transportation, such as trucks. We strive to responsibly support customers’ products at each stage of the product lifecycle, including recycling the railcar through scrap and salvage at the end of its useful life.
Social Responsibility
 
We actively engage stakeholders across our environmental, health and safety initiatives to continually improve processes and performance as we operate our businesses with a goal of zero injuries and incidents. We strive to attract and retain a diverse and empowered workforce. Our priorities include fostering an inclusive and collaborative workplace, promoting opportunities for professional development, improving the well-being of our employees and other stakeholders, and contributing to the communities in which we operate.
Governance
 
Our goal is to promote the long-term interests of stakeholders, strengthen accountability, and inspire trust. We have focused our governance practices to promote best-in-class leadership, diversity, independence and stockholder-aligned incentive practices at the most senior levels. Our Board includes an independent Chairman and diverse and independent Board members who help ensure that our business strategies and programs, including our compensation program, are aligned with stakeholder interests. Our Board and senior management teams are also committed to the Company’s continued respect for human rights throughout all our operations.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Railcar Industry

The Federal Railroad Administration, or FRA, administers and enforces U.S. federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety compliance standards for freight railcars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to freight railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies freight railcar manufacturers and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States as well as providers of railcar repair and maintenance services. New products must generally undergo AAR testing and approval processes. As a result of these regulations, we must maintain certifications with the AAR as a freight railcar manufacturer and products that we sell must meet AAR and FRA standards.

We are also subject to oversight in other jurisdictions by foreign regulatory agencies and to the extent that we expand our business internationally, we will increasingly be subject to the regulations of other non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligent acts, but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. In addition, these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under the common law.

Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses. We believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

Future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. In addition, we have in the past conducted investigation and remediation activities at properties that we own to address historic contamination. To date, the costs of such activities have not been material. Although we believe we have satisfactorily addressed all known material contamination through our remediation activities, there can be no assurance that these activities have addressed all historic contamination. The discovery of historic contamination or the release of hazardous substances into the environment could require us in the future to incur investigative or remedial costs or other liabilities that could be material or that could interfere with the operation of our business.

In addition to environmental laws, the transportation of commodities by railcar raises potential risks in the event of a derailment or other accident. Generally, liability under existing law in the United States for a derailment or other accident depends on the negligence of the party, such as the railroad, the shipper or the manufacturer of the railcar or its components. However, for the shipment of certain hazardous commodities, strict liability concepts may apply.
