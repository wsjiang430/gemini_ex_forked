 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Nuburu,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this section are to the business and operations of Legacy Nuburu prior to the Business Combination and to the Company and its subsidiaries following the Business Combination.
Corporate History and Background
 We were originally incorporated in Delaware on July 21, 2020 under the name “Tailwind Acquisition Corp.” as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more target businesses. On September 9, 2020 (the “IPO Closing Date”), we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”). On January 31, 2023, we consummated a business combination with Nuburu Subsidiary, Inc. f/k/a Nuburu, Inc. (“Legacy Nuburu”), a privately held operating company which merged into our subsidiary Compass Merger Sub, Inc. (the “Business Combination”) and changed our name to “Nuburu, Inc.,” and we became the owner, directly or indirectly, of all of the equity interests of Nuburu Subsidiary, Inc. and its subsidiaries. In light of the fact that the Business Combination has closed and our ongoing business will be the business formerly operated by Legacy Nuburu, this business section primarily includes information regarding Legacy Nuburu’s business.
Overview
 Nuburu is a leading innovator in high-power, high-brightness blue laser technology that is focused on bringing breakthrough improvements to a broad range of high value applications including welding and 3D printing. By delivering increased speed and quality we hope to enhance productivity and cost efficiency for manufacturers in the e-mobility, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense and 3D printing markets as well as to find additional applications currently not yet serviced by existing laser technologies.
 We have invented, patented and developed what we believe to be the next pivotal point for manufacturing technology, with the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by changing how products are made. Our technology is also aligned with the need to reduce carbon generation in manufacturing. Most manufacturing processes require heat to shape, manipulate and form basic materials into a product. The Nuburu laser system outperforms currently available alternatives by more efficiently coupling heat into the material being processed, thereby helping to promote a more sustainable future by using less energy and, in turn, generating less carbon in the manufacturing process.
 A fundamental physical characteristic is that metals absorb blue laser light better than infrared (“IR”) laser light. In the case of materials such as gold, copper, silver and aluminum the advantage of blue laser light is substantial. The better absorption results in substantial improvements in the quality of the part produced, the yield of parts during production and the speed at which the part can be produced. We believe that these advantages enable efficiencies in the overall productivity of the manufacturing line and can extend the life of the products produced. We also believe that these characteristics will be advantageous to our customers, whether in upgrading existing manufacturing processes or enabling entirely new approaches to manufacturing through the use of Nuburu’s laser systems in either industrial welding or 3D printing technology applications.
 Nuburu is currently shipping blue laser systems for welding applications such as batteries, large screen displays and cell phone components. We have performed thousands of welds in hundreds of application tests to date and we believe we have a strong and substantial customer pipeline for our laser light engines.
 Nuburu has developed a thorough understanding of the market need for its laser light engines across a broad array of applications including battery, e-mobility, consumer electronics, and 3D printing metal systems. We estimate that our serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) will grow from approximately $4 billion today to approximately $33 billion by 2032 (see “— Market Opportunity”).
 Nuburu’s co-founders identified these market opportunities at an early stage and began working in 2013 to protect their early mover advantage with a strong patent portfolio. Nuburu has over 190 granted and pending patents and patent applications globally, which include: blue laser applications such as welding, blue laser technologies, single mode blue laser technology, blue Raman laser technologies, addressable array technologies, and 3D printing using blue lasers. Notably, Nuburu has been awarded patent protection for the use of high-power blue lasers. At the time Nuburu was started, industrial quality, high-power blue lasers did not exist and Nuburu was the first to successfully apply blue lasers to the practice of welding and 3D printing.
 Industry Background
 Industrial markets have been a major focus for laser applications ever since the invention of the laser. In the early 1970s, lasers emerged as a useful source for cutting and welding. However, the material systems were limited to steel and other materials with low reflectivity given the long wavelengths of the Infrared Carbon Dioxide (IR CO2) lasers that were the mainstay of that era.
 The first era was followed by the introduction of lamp-pump yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers in the late 1970s with a shorter wavelength and more compact size, which resulted in an expansion of applications into cutting, welding and drilling. The lamp pumped lasers were superseded in the 1980s by the invention of diode pumped solid state lasers which offered higher efficiency and superior reliability.
 However, the lamp pump lasers still had poor absorption in materials such as aluminum and copper given the IR wavelength of these lasers.
 In the early 2000s, the fiber laser was introduced into the industrial laser market and offered superior efficiency, reliability, and scalability than the diode pumped solid state lasers and was rapidly adopted because of its compact size. The fiber laser with its improved performance displaced the CO2 lasers in 3D printing and ushered in a new era for additive manufacturing (3D printing). Currently, fiber lasers account for approximately 50% of the total materials processing laser market according to Laser Focus World, in part because of their compact size and ease of operation. The fiber laser, however, still operates at the IR wavelength with low absorption in materials such as copper and aluminum.


Market Opportunity
 We estimate the total addressable market (“TAM”) for industrial lasers that could be replaced by blue lasers (i.e., our total revenue opportunity at 100% market share, assuming no competition), to be $15 billion today and to grow to over $65 billion in the next ten years. Our estimated TAM was constructed by our management team using three primary elements: the 3D metal printing system market analysis published in the AMPOWER 2022 market report, the blue addressable laser market published in the Laser Focus World 2022 market report and the non-laser technology replacement market which was estimated by Nuburu based on its discussions with existing and potential customers about their expected production needs and anticipated demand.
 Included in our estimated TAM is the 3D printing metal system market, which is a $2.7 billion market today, including machines, service and materials, and is projected to grow to over $8.4 billion by 2026 based on projections by AMPOWER and to $32.8 by 2032 based on our own estimates. The TAM for industrial lasers that could be replaced by blue lasers is $10.5 billion today and, assuming a greater than 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), based on projections by Laser Focus World’s 2022 market summary and our own estimates, could reach approximately $35 billion by 2032. In addition, we have included a non-laser conversion TAM, which we estimate to be $0.75 billion today and which we project to grow to $5.6 billion by 2032, assuming the conversion of ultrasonic and contact welding methods to blue laser welding methods. This data is shown in the following chart and results in an estimated TAM of over $65 billion.

We have also estimated Nuburu’s serviceable addressable market (“SAM”), which is depicted in the chart below and represents the portion of our estimated TAM that can be served by our existing and planned products, again assuming no competition. Our management team constructed this estimate by conducting a bottom-up analysis that factored in discussions with customers and analyzed how the blue laser systems we manufacture today can address the laser welding and 3D printing markets. The calculation of SAM for our blue laser systems includes the conversion of non-laser machine tools to laser-based systems, and the battery, EV, consumer electronics and display manufacturing market segments.
 The 3D printing portion is included in our calculation of SAM given our intent to penetrate this market with blue-laser based 3D printers. We estimate our SAM to be $4 billion today and expect it to grow to over $33 billion in the next ten years.
 The estimated SAM shown below is a bottom-up calculation driven by feedback provided by a survey of certain of our current and potential customers in each of the sub segments indicated. The volume estimates consider:
 •the number of existing production lines to be retrofitted over time;
 •the number of planned new production lines;
 •an average estimated laser replacement of about four years; and
 •do not account for the use of blue lasers in new applications currently not utilizing lasers other than for very limited recently identified segments.
 Based on the foregoing, we estimate the light engine industrial laser segment to grow from $2.7 billion in 2022 to over $9.5 billion in 2032, driven by the electrification of key market segments including batteries, e-mobility, consumer electronics and metal 3D printing systems. This

projected market growth is a combination of new market opportunities and replacing fiber lasers and solid-state lasers in existing applications. The 3D printing metal systems market is expected to grow from over $2 billion in 2022 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% to over $32 billion in 2032, according to the AMPOWER 2022 report and Nuburu estimates.
 Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

 We believe Nuburu’s existing and planned products are well positioned to address our SAM, and as we continue to develop products based on new technology, we hope to be well positioned to compete in the larger TAM in the future.
Key Growth Trends
 Over time, manufacturing operations have begun to integrate lasers into material processing applications. We believe that areas that have seen and continue to experience rapid growth, such as 3D printing, energy storage, e-mobility, and consumer electronics, have been more concerned with how, where and when they can integrate lasers into their operations, rather than if they should adopt them.
 In addition to such long-standing trends of manufacturing ecosystems in converting to superior production technologies, there are two global macro trends that we believe will serve as powerful “tailwinds” driving growth in the market for laser systems, including (i) energy de-carbonization and electrification and (ii) supply chain improvements and manufacturing reshoring. Nuburu believes both of these trends will serve as drivers to the attractiveness and adoption of its products.
 With respect to the trend of energy de-carbonization and electrification, many nations with large economies have announced and begun implementing, in varying degrees, energy policies directed at decreasing carbon emissions. The paths to executing these policies include increasing the electrification of certain modes of transportation. We expect to benefit from this trend, as batteries, which Nuburu’s blue laser technology is able to weld more efficiently, are a key element of these policies.
 There is also a global trend towards making supply chain improvements and reshoring manufacturing to domestic production. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the related widespread lockdowns, combined with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, exposed vulnerabilities and weaknesses in global supply chains across an array of products. This has led companies and governments to reconsider their existing supply chains and has led to an uptick in business planning and policy-making that aims to relocate the manufacturing of key components and sub-assembly lines within domestic markets, closer to downstream assembly and manufacturing plants. One potential means to reshore and reduce supply chain vulnerability is to increase the use of 3D printing to allow manufacturers to “print on demand” the many components needed to fabricate products, or to completely print products in one step. We also believe that our products offer meaningful solutions to this trend, as Nuburu’s blue laser technology can help provide the means to cost effectively produce parts on demand.
 Our Technology
 Although IR lasers are the incumbent technology used in many systems today, we believe that they are not the optimum choice for processing aluminum, copper, gold, and other reflective metals. Nuburu believes its technology is well positioned to usher in a new era of manufacturing, extending laser technology to far broader applications and markets.
 Nuburu is currently targeting two major markets: (i) laser welding or material processing and (ii) metal 3D printing. Both markets have grown substantially in recent years, already resulting in multi-billion-dollar TAMs and SAMs, and we believe both are poised to experience further substantial growth.
 Welding


Nuburu’s initial focus is on the materials processing market. The blue industrial laser offers improved quality and speed to welding and joining applications driven by superior absorption of the blue laser relative to an IR laser. For example, in copper, which is an important material in the electrification wave of manufacturing, absorption of IR lasers is only 5%, while blue lasers achieve absorption of 65%.
 Traditional IR welding and joining is effectively a violent process that vaporizes the target metal, ejecting particulates and leaving holes behind. To minimize these problems, IR lasers have employed multiple methods to minimize the defects when welding high reflectivity materials, the two most common of which are (i) the use of a scanner to create a swirl pattern on the metal and (ii) the use of a dual beam or ring beam.
 The first method, the use of a scanner-based swirl pattern, does work, but it results in a more complex welding pattern which in turn results in a slower speed for a given laser power. By contrast, the blue laser of the same equivalent power can directly weld the copper material substantially faster (up to 8x faster) with minimal to no defects in the weld and minimal to no spatter generation during the welding process.
 The second method, the ring laser beam, uses a lower power laser beam surrounding a high intensity laser beam. The lower power laser beam preheats the metal to the point that the high intensity laser beam can couple its energy into the part. In the case of copper, this preheating technique increases the absorption from about 5% to 15%, which is sufficient for the IR laser to be able to initiate the weld. By contrast a blue laser with the same power level will weld copper substantially faster (up to 8x faster) than the ring laser and with greater energy efficiency because of the much higher absorption of the blue laser beam (65%) compared to the IR ring laser. While the ring laser must use excess energy to even initiate the weld, the blue laser simply welds the parts. This is very evident when welding copper foils, where the ring laser is only capable of a spot weld, while the blue laser is capable of continuous welding of the foils, a feature highly desired in battery manufacturing.
 Nuburu’s blue laser therefore offers valuable capabilities for improving the means to manufacture at a lower cost than what is currently possible with IR lasers. We also expect that these capabilities will lead to the wider adoption of laser welding as it will allow manufacturers that until now have used lasers primarily for welding steel and stainless-steel components to also use lasers on more reflective materials such as copper and aluminum (which are used in great quantities in electric vehicles).
 Metal 3D Printing
 Nuburu’s second focus is metal 3D printing. 3D printing is performed with many different methods; however, the most common laser-based methods fall into one of three categories: (i) laser powder bed fusion, (ii) direct energy deposition and (iii) laser-based wire feed. Each of these methods has its advantages, the powder bed fusion method currently offers the highest resolution and finest feature printing capabilities, but also the slowest printing rates. The direct metal deposition method has a poorer surface finish and cannot print as fine of features as the powder bed fusion, but it does achieve very high build speeds. The laser-based wire feed printing method produces a relatively rough surface finish, but it can print much larger parts at very high speeds which is its key advantage.
Powder Bed Fusion
 Powder bed fusion is a method for 3D printing where a thin layer of powdered feedstock is laid down, and then an energy source melts particles together at specific locations on that plane. A subsequent particle layer is deposited and again selectively melted, joining powder on the top layer to the previously melted layer beneath. This process is repeated with a different pattern for each layer until the part is completed. Once completed, the part is removed from the build plate and the unmelted powder is recovered and recycled to be used again in the process. The part is cleaned, inspected and the final machining steps are performed to achieve the desired part features and dimensions.
 When a laser is the energy source for powder bed fusion, the technique is called selective laser melting. Lasers are the preferable option for the energy source because alternative methods, such as an electron beam, require the build volume to be in a vacuum. However, traditional IR lasers suffer from the same limitations in 3D printers that also limit their effectiveness in welding applications. A high intensity laser beam is rapidly scanned across the powder bed melting and vaporizing the metal particles. While the smallest particles are readily vaporized, some portions of the larger particles are also vaporized. This is problematic in several ways. First, the metal plume that comes off the powder as the metal vaporizes requires complex fume filtering and management. Second, metal vaporization being trapped in the part during printing may create a void or defect in the part that could be a weakness in the final part produced. This weakness may be a mechanical weakness, or in the case of copper, the thermal and electrical characteristics may be degraded due to the presence of these voids. A third issue that arises when trying to scale the physical part size and the printing volume is the management of the plume of metal as it can easily redeposit on an adjacent area of the part or an adjacent part. This condensation of the metal vapor can also cause voids and defects in the parts, making scaling up laser powder bed fusion systems using IR lasers challenging for machine designers because of these limitations in the fundamental process of rapidly melting the metal.
 When used in a powder bed fusion application, the blue laser can be incorporated in one of two ways. The first, is simply a drop-in replacement for the IR laser, which already represents a significant improvement as blue laser has the advantage of increased absorption and consequently increased printing speed. This printing speed advantage has been demonstrated by Nuburu in both copper and stainless steel, with consistently faster printing speeds than achieved with an IR laser.
 However, the blue laser, because of its high absorption rate, can also be used in a different mode of printing, one that does not lead to vaporization of the metal and consequently a dramatic reduction in the voids or defects created in the part during the printing process. This process is the conduction mode printing process where a large spot size with a low laser power density is used to take advantage of the enhanced absorption of the laser beam. The use of this large spot size is best described as area printing, where the spot is an image to be printed rather than just a spot. This results in a very calm melting of the powder with little to no vaporization, thereby substantially eliminating the need for fume management and successfully avoiding many pitfalls of the current 3D printing methods. The result is a substantial increase in print speed and the ability to easily scale up the printing method to large areas or to a large part count in a single printing run.
 Direct Energy Deposition (DED)


Direct Energy Deposition (DED) is the method where the powder is delivered by a nozzle into the laser beam as the beam traverses the part being produced. The advantages of this method include the very efficient use of powder and the ability to deposit metal at a very high build rate. The powder use is more efficient than a powder bed system, because only the powder to be deposited is used in the process, unlike a powder bed, where the entire area of the part is covered with powder as it is being produced. This method has been in use for many years for remanufacturing old parts as well as producing new parts. A very precise motion control system is required to maintain surface quality as well as build quality. However, the surface quality and the minimum wall thickness is a direct function of the large spot size used in this method and consequently this method cannot achieve the same part resolution or surface finish as a powder bed based system.
 We believe that the blue laser is an ideal source for this method because of its ability to couple the laser power efficiently into the powder as it is rapidly approaching the build surface. The powder must be completely melted before reaching the surface to be properly incorporated into the build. The high absorption characteristics of the blue laser light enables the rapid heating of all metal materials that would be used with this method, resulting in Nuburu’s blue laser achieving an increase in build speed of up to 7x in copper and 3x in stainless steel compared to an equivalent IR laser.
 Laser-based Wire Feed
 Wire feed deposition is the method of 3D printing where a wire is fed into the laser beam as the beam traverses the part. This method has also been used for many years for remanufacturing old parts as well as producing new parts. A very high precision motion control system is likewise required to maintain surface quality as well as build quality. The overall surface quality and minimum wall thickness is limited by the wire thickness used in this method. Consequently, this method cannot achieve the same part resolution or surface finish as a powder bed system, but it can achieve very high metal deposition rates.
 We believe that the blue laser is an ideal source for this method because of its ability to couple the laser power efficiently into the wire as it is rapidly approaching the build surface. The wire must be completely melted just as it reaches the build surface. This approach requires a wire feed head that can operate in any direction coupled to the blue laser and a very fine control of the wire as it is fed into the laser beam. The approach can deposit material very fast and uses a gantry style system to trace out and build the part. Some companies have used 6-axis robots to accomplish the same type of build, allowing very large parts to be fabricated out of materials such as titanium and other alloys. Nuburu is working with other companies that are developing systems using a very fine wirefeed method which should greatly improve the surface finish and allow the manufacturing of very large parts (~1m3).
Blue Laser in 3D Printing
 Nuburu believes its blue laser technology has the potential to be a novel solution for 3D printing by opening an entirely new path to lowering 3D printing costs. We expect the blue laser light engine will be a “plug and play” replacement for today’s IR lasers, enabling both new systems to be built as well as old systems to be upgraded. Once upgraded, we expect that these light engines will provide a wider material processing capability, higher printing speeds, better resolution and stronger as printer parts. Nuburu has demonstrated this capability by integrating its blue laser into a commercial 3D printed and quantifying the speed and performance advantages. In addition, the blue laser has demonstrated the ability to print “hard to print” materials such as copper and gold. These results can be attributed to the enhanced absorption characteristics of the blue laser light which enabled the blue laser to print these materials when the IR lasers could not melt the base material in either a powder bed printer or wire feed printer. These results highlight that Nuburu’s blue laser provides increased flexibility with respect to the material used in blue laser-based 3D printer. We believe this flexibility in material processing makes the blue laser a superior choice for customers when designing their production lines and making their purchasing choices.
 A challenge with 3D printing is to print parts that are competitive in cost with more conventional metal manufacturing methods such as casting and injection molding. Nuburu has demonstrated and applied for patents on a new area printing technology (“APT”). Nuburu is currently designing and testing this new technology which we believe has the potential to greatly increase the printing speed of a more conventional 3D printer. The projected printing rates for this technology would make the per part cost competitive with more conventional means of manufacturing such as sand casting and injection molding. We believe that the APT approach to printing challenges the paradigm of today’s 3D printers and consequently has the potential to become a breakthrough technology that could propel 3D printing into major manufacturing markets by meeting the cost per part required by these industries and permitting the printing of much larger parts.
 Nuburu has already demonstrated this printing technique in the laboratory and is now being funded through a U.S. Air Force contract from AFWERX to develop a full-scale version of such a printer (see “— Research and Development — Research”).
 Benefits of Our Technology
 We believe Nuburu’s blue lasers are an ideal manufacturing tool for a number of reasons.
 Wavelength Characteristics
 Fundamental physics states that the color of the light directly represents the energy carried by light. As the energy of the light increases so does the ability of materials to absorb this energy. Metal absorption is one manifestation of this inherent property of blue. In other words, no amount of manipulation can change the way that metals absorb other wavelengths of light, meaning that blue has an inherent superiority for processing steel, gold, titanium, aluminum, copper, nickel, and many other metals. This applies to metal surfaces that are machined, polished, sandblasted or etched which has no effect on the ability of the laser to melt or weld the material.
 Superiority to IR Lasers
 The blue laser is adept at welding parts that are difficult for an IR laser to weld, particularly reflective metals such as copper, gold and aluminum. The IR wavelength is poorly absorbed by these materials, so IR lasers struggle to create and sustain melting. The ways that IR lasers can overcome the absorptivity issues are either by preheating the metal or by increasing the laser intensity until the material vaporizes

and creates what is termed a keyhole. While this allows absorption, the process is violent and creates spatter and debris on the component and voids in the weld. Spatter creates loose debris in assemblies which may cause electrical short circuits and failure. Pores in the weld zone reduce strength and electrical performance.
 A substantial number of products requires some level of welding, for example, batteries in an electric vehicle, cell phones, cell phone components and large screen displays. These products contain significant amounts of copper, gold, aluminum and stainless steel which must be joined together at some point during the assembly of the product. Nuburu’s light engines are able to deliver the necessary heat required to weld the precision parts together quickly and with high manufacturing yields.
 Permits Welding of Smaller Features
 Nuburu uses patented technology to spatially and spectrally combine the outputs of blue wavelength diodes. The diodes are individually aligned to produce smaller spot size and higher intensity. This high intensity, or brightness, creates a smaller laser focus and therefore allows welding or melting of smaller features. In addition, the high brightness allows greater distances from the focus lens to the workpiece allowing scan head beam delivery or access into remote positions. In summary, Nuburu blue lasers offer flexible output for use in an automated machine.
 
(1) Speed across materials on a per watt basis.
 3D Printing Compatibility
 Nuburu provides manufacturers with blue lasers for welding, cutting, stripping coatings and 3D printing. These lasers, when combined with external optical components, make up a light engine. Our customers are able to integrate our blue light engines into their manufacturing processes in a variety of ways, including by directly attaching the laser to a scanner to allow for rapidly redirecting of the laser beams across a part or, in the case of 3D printing, the powder bed. We believe that this compatibility enables our blue laser-based light engines to be a plug and play replacement for today’s IR lasers.
 Alternatively, a Nuburu laser fiber could be attached to a welding or cutting head and then mounted on a motion system to allow the laser beam to be moved and repositioned. Finally, a Nuburu light engine could consist of a Nuburu laser and a light modulation system that enables a new generation of 3D printers based on APT rather than single spot printing, which is currently the industry standard. We believe this approach to 3D printing, which we are currently working to develop, has the potential to revolutionize the industry by delivering increased speed and quality in printing metal parts.
 Modular Design
 Nuburu’s laser systems are based on a modular design where the lowest power module is the building block for higher power systems. This homogenizes the supply chain, streamlines production and allows for rapid new product development. By using a common module approach, we aim to achieve lower costs, consistent performance, good reliability and simplified serviceability.
Simple Design
 The Nuburu laser designs are straight forward and designed for automated assembly. The light from the individual laser diodes is combined with no additional steps to create the beam. This is referred to as a direct diode laser source and is more efficient than other technologies, requiring less electrical power to run the machine. To achieve high power, high brightness from its laser systems, Nuburu’s automated manufacturing methods align all of the optical components of the system. Each laser diode operates at a different wavelength or color and they are each superimposed on each other to achieve a laser beam brightness that is the same as a single emitter. A linear array of sources is created with this method which represents the highest brightness and power that can be achieved from the combination of so many laser diodes. The high brightness translates into the lowest possible beam divergence for the product. The low beam divergence is essential for integration with industry-standard optical scanning systems, including those integral to both production lines and powder bed fusion 3D printing.
Recognition
 The value proposition of the Nuburu commercial product line has led to several industrial and academic partnerships, along with industry recognition, including: Finalist Prism Award — Photonics Media (2018), Innovators Award, Platinum Honoree — Laser Focus World (2018), Innovators Award, Gold Honoree — Laser Focus World (2019), Innovation Award — Laser World of Photonics (2019), Technology Innovation Award, Best Practices Award, Frost & Sullivan (2019), and Innovators Award, Gold Honoree — Laser Focus World (2020). In addition, in 2019, Frost and Sullivan awarded Nuburu its Technology Innovation Award recognizing Nuburu as a company employing best practices.
Key Advantages
 For welding applications, Nuburu’s blue industrial laser provides the following key advantages when compared to conventional welding methods:
 •High energy process efficiency due to the high absorption of the blue laser light;
 •Higher speed because there is no need for pre-heating;
 •Greater part strength due to minimal voids;
 •Lower electrical resistance due to minimal voids; and
 •Superior part quality due to lack of ejected material during the welding process.
 For additive manufacturing, Nuburu’s blue laser light engines provide the following advantages:
 •High energy process efficiency due to the high absorption of the blue laser light;
 •Higher speed because of the higher absorption on the parts;
 •Greater part strength due to minimal voids;
 •Lower electrical resistance due to minimal voids;
 •Higher part yield due to the reduced spatter not causing defects in adjacent parts; and
 •Smaller part size as the blue laser can be focused on a tighter spot size.
 Our Products
 In 2017, Nuburu launched the world’s first commercially available high-power blue industrial laser, the Nuburu AO-150. This laser demonstrated the ability to weld the thin foils used in lithium-ion batteries.
 These batteries are the predominant rechargeable power source for portable devices and tools, and are built using layers of thin copper and aluminum foils separated by electrolytes that hold and release the electrical charges. The foils must be joined along one edge, but traditional manufacturing methods of achieving this have been unsatisfactory: Soldering is time consuming; ultrasonic welding creates poor quality welds and requires tool contact and thus entails associated repair and replacement costs; and the IR can only spot weld these foils, both of which prevent batteries from achieving high performance. By contrast the Nuburu AO-150 welds these foils rapidly with essentially no particle ejection or voids left behind.
 In 2018, Nuburu launched the higher power AO-500 and additional supporting hardware, extending the range of applications for the blue industrial laser. For example, the lithium-ion batteries described above are built around thin foils, but the foils are welded to tabs, the tabs to the case, and then the case to busbars that connect individual modules together for high-capacity batteries. Each of those joints might connect different materials and different thicknesses of materials. A single blue industrial laser can perform all these welds with straightforward adjustments of laser power and other parameters. This provides the direct advantage of high-quality connections produced at high speeds, and the indirect advantages associated with reduced production line footprint, and decreased maintenance and training costs.
 Nuburu has continued to improve the performance of the blue industrial laser. In 2019, Nuburu was able to integrate the next generation of laser diodes into the AO-150 and AO-500 products producing 200 Watt and 650 Watts respectively, which enabled us to introduce the AO-200 and the AO-650. Nuburu continues to improve the performance of its AO-650 laser with the latest lasers with greater lifetime and power margin. Nuburu has combined two AO-650 lasers to study applications requiring up to 1,400 Watts of laser power. Numerous tests were performed at power levels up to 1,400 Watts providing a guideline for the products that will be needed to address the major copper welding markets indicating that higher power and smaller spot sizes will be needed.
 Nuburu based its long-term roadmap, shown in the chart below, on these early test results. Following these results, an entirely new product design approach was adopted that we expect will provide higher brightness and rapid scalability to multi-kilowatt (“kW”) power levels. This is the BL series laser, where the beam quality has been improved by a factor of 3x and the output power of the base model has been upgraded to 250 Watts.
 Nuburu announced the commercial launch of the first laser in the NUBURU BL Series, the BL-250, in January 2023. We anticipate that the BL-250 will serve as the base building block for additional products. By combining multiple modules into a single laser system, Nuburu expects to develop a product with increased continuous power. For example, combining four BL-250 modules into a single laser system would allow for a product with over 1,000 Watts of continuous power. Furthermore, by combining the 1,000-Watt subsystems, Nuburu expects to be able to extend the output power to 2kW and 4kW. Nuburu anticipates that the output power of the blue laser diodes in these systems will continue to improve and expects upgrades to these systems will be straightforward resulting in an upgrade of these systems to 1.5kW, 2.5kW and 4.5kW. With this modular design approach, we expect to rapidly achieve scale in our automated production line, homogenize our supply chain, streamline our production, and increase the speed of product development. We expect this modular approach to enable us to deliver consistent performance, good reliability, and simplified customer serviceability at competitive prices.



We expect to begin releasing the high-power systems ranging in power from 1.5kW to 4.5kW in 2024. For this line of products, Nuburu expects the final products to be in the form of a light engine, encompassing both the laser and the beam delivery system. Our beam delivery system can be one of two types: (i) an optical scanner-based system or (ii) a welding head with sensors. We are developing the BL product line to be compatible with existing scanners, which works by rapidly scanning the beam across the processing surface with a pair of orthogonal mirrors.
 Both our AO and BL product lines have been designed to be compatible with standard welding heads which may include a variety of sensors, such as a seam tracker and a weld quality monitor. These beam delivery systems are an add-on to the sale of laser systems because Nuburu is committed to providing a complete welding solution to its customers.
 We are also currently working to develop the next generation of blue lasers to be released in our product roadmap, involving a single mode blue fiber laser (NUBURU SMTM Series) which we anticipate being unmatched in performance and brightness in the industry. We have designed and are currently testing the first alpha prototype. We are designing this line of single mode blue lasers to be compatible with both types of beam delivery systems; however, the optical scanner will be the preferred beam delivery system. Today every powder bed 3D printer uses an IR laser and a scanner. We are designing the Nuburu single mode laser to be a direct drop-in replacement for the incumbent IR lasers. 3D printing with the blue single mode laser benefits from the high absorption of the blue light creating solid parts with good surface quality at near net shape independent of the material being processed. For steel, titanium, pure copper, and copper alloys, our initial testing results demonstrate significant improvements in build rate and part quality, and reduction in post-processing time.

 Our Growth Strategy
 Nuburu aims to become the pre-eminent global supplier of lasers for welding and 3D printing for a significant range of industrially important metals in both established and emerging manufacturing applications. Our growth strategy is driven by two global industrial trends:
 The growing importance of quality and speed for large scale volume manufacturing in energy storage, consumer electronics, e-mobility, aerospace and other industries.
 Burgeoning 3D printing applications, particularly for high-value aerospace, automotive and medical metal parts.
 Some key aspects of our growth strategy include:
 Maintain and develop products for welding
 Nuburu expects to make the blue laser the technology of choice for welding applications such as batteries, consumer electronics (such as cell phones, tablets and large screen displays), electric vehicles and renewable energy. The speed, quality and yield that can be achieved with the blue laser is the key driver in its adoption into these markets. Nuburu’s AO product line has already made inroads into manufacturing components for cell phones, displays and wire-feed 3D printing. We expect that Nuburu’s BL product line will expand the range of applications that can be addressed by combining the blue laser with a scanner to enable remote welding of batteries, consumer electronics and

electric vehicle components. The scanner capability opens market opportunities for the blue laser because of its ability to rapidly move the beam from weld seam to weld seam. This light engine provides the production speed and quality sought by manufacturers for welding batteries, consumer electronics and electrical vehicle components.
 Integrate Blue lasers into Directed Energy Deposition 3D Printing
 Nuburu has integrated its AO-650 into a Directed Energy Deposition (DED) machine capable of printing parts using blown powder. In a direct comparison, the Nuburu blue laser outperformed an IR laser by a wide margin resulting in a substantial improvement in printing energy efficiency which translates directly to speed, a superior surface finish, and near forged metal densities. While this is a small portion of the additive market, it is an important one that enables our light engines to print large scale parts from a variety of materials such as titanium and copper alloys. The blue laser-based DED machine provided manufacturers with the speed, surface finish and densification required by markets such as aerospace.
 Integrate single mode blue laser into additive machines
 Nuburu is developing a single mode blue laser (SM) that we expect to be a drop-in replacement for the IR fiber lasers used in 3D powder bed printers today. This technology is at the center of the Nuburu research and development efforts where the initial demonstration of a single mode blue fiber laser was successful. Nuburu is now working to scale the output power of the laser to its initial offering of 100 Watts CW. This laser is expected to expand the additive space, allowing the fabrication of parts that are 10x the size of parts fabricated with an IR laser, at speeds up to 7x faster for a given power level and to print metals that are reflective in the near IR. This technology is compatible with existing systems, allowing customers the flexibility to upgrade their existing systems to blue as an alternative to ordering an entirely new 3D printing system. The improvement in process speed and part quality is expected to enable the mass adoption of 3D printing in aerospace, healthcare, dentistry, jewelry and other general manufacturing applications.
 Next Generation Blue Laser Additive Systems
 Nuburu has demonstrated the ability to print metal parts with its APT. We expect that this system will flash print over 2 million spots simultaneously in an area over 1,000x greater than the single spot used in today’s printers. The laser light engines are modular in their design which allows a powder bed printer system to be outfitted with a single light engine or multiple light engines. Multiple light engines provide a path to very high printing speeds, and lower operating costs. This method of printing relies on the conduction mode printing referred to earlier in this document and will not have the complicated fume management systems required in today’s large area printers. A system based on several light engines has the potential to achieve 10-20kg/hr printing speeds while maintaining a 0.050mm minimum part resolution. We expect that a breakthrough in speed while maintaining resolution and part quality will enable adoption in cost sensitive markets such as automotive and consumer products.
 With respect to all of the 3D printing applications, Nuburu anticipates growing its capabilities organically or through partnerships or acquisitions.
 Extend Blue Laser Capabilities
 Nuburu believes it has only started to uncover the many potential applications of this technology beyond the two major markets explored to date: vehicle electrification and 3D printing. With expanded resources we expect to be able to uncover additional applications in defense, healthcare, solar energy and semiconductor processing markets. In addition, we believe that as Nuburu introduces new products they will find applications in the growing market-place.
Manufacturing and Supply
 Manufacturing
 Nuburu is located in Centennial, Colorado with an approximate 30,000 sq. ft. facility. The facility primarily supports applications testing, manufacturing, engineering, and research and development of lasers and laser systems. Approximately 2,400 sq. ft. of our facility is a clean room facility in which the laser light engine modules are manufactured, assembled, and tested. Other areas of the facility facilitate the integration of the laser light engine modules with control and power electronics into a chassis to form laser systems. Completed laser systems undergo testing and quality control within the facility.
 We anticipate that our current facility can support the manufacturing volumes forecasted through 2025 and perhaps beyond. Needed capacity increases can be accomplished by improvements to the manufacturing line, adding equipment to bottleneck manufacturing steps as well as expansion of key areas. Specifically, we are planning to expand the cleanroom area to 3,200 sq. ft. by extending it into a currently unused space. We expect to be able to improve production flow through modest infrastructure leasehold improvements, such as removal of divisive walls and inclusion of doors and passthroughs in strategic locations. These improvements would allow the product assembly to flow in a continuous uninterrupted line, increasing efficiencies.
 Nuburu’s lasers are designed to be compatible with automated manufacturing methods. Nuburu continually improves the design of its lasers as well as the automation equipment required to manufacture these systems. Our strategy for scaling up our existing manufacturing line is based on two key elements: (i) optimizing the automated production flow and (ii) minimizing the touch labor. The automated assembly provides both the needed precision as well as the reproducibility of the assembly to manufacture the high precision blue laser modules. Since the key steps are performed with automated machines, we can minimize both the touch labor as well as the skill set needed for manufacturing. These elements combine to provide Nuburu with a cost effective and scalable manufacturing strategy. However, once the base production line design is finalized, the entire production line may be replicated as many times as is needed to increase capacity, limited only by space constraints and infrastructure limitations.


Throughout the manufacturing process, Nuburu uses multiple screening steps to check the quality of its products beginning with an initial automated screening test that identifies laser diodes that are below performance standards. For this initial test, six laser diodes are integrated into an assembly and undergo a visual inspection. The diodes are also turned on to quantify their performance and verify that they meet specifications. Those units are then integrated into a screening station and operated for a predetermined period to eliminate early failures, which are referred to as infant mortalities. Once they have passed this first step, they are integrated into a module, which is then tested for performance before integration into a system. After integration into a system, Nuburu uses a week-long test procedure to confirm that the electronics and laser are performing according to specifications.
 We expect to work to reduce waste and limit costs while developing robust manufacturing processes with the aim of enhancing our competitive advantage in the marketplace. To do this, we expect to incorporate the Six Sigma Lean methodologies as well as ISO quality standards to ensure we meet customer expectations. With Six Sigma, we expect to further improve the quality of our products and decrease the variations that cause rework or defects. By incorporating the 5S pillars of the Six Sigma process into our day-to-day work life, we expect to develop a streamlined productive work environment ensuring organized and improved cycle times, with the aim of reducing the cost of goods sold. Through these tools we aim to create an environment that demands quality and performance, while reducing downtime and defects that are generated from undefined processes and underutilized talent.
 We anticipate that as we ramp up our manufacturing, we will require additional engineers and production personnel to build out and then operate our manufacturing capabilities.
 Supply
 We purchase raw materials used to manufacture our products and other components, such as laser diodes, micro-optics, optics, optical filters, bulk optics, cooling components, electronic components, and other materials, from various suppliers. We purchase materials and components through purchase orders or agreed-upon terms and conditions with our key suppliers. To mitigate raw material and component supply chain issues and risks, we aim to take a variety of actions such as second source qualification, accumulation of safety stock and vendor surveillance. We may also consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations. If we transition locations, we may increase our inventory of such products as a “safety stock” during the transition, which would cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
Partnerships
 Over the past five years, Nuburu has developed a number of partnerships in cell phone component welding systems, display welding systems, and 3D printing.
 Key research institutes
 Nuburu has established various partnerships, past or current, with prominent welding and 3D printing institutes including Edison Welding Institute in North America, two Fraunhofer institutes and Munich Technical University in Germany, Warwick University (WMG — Energy Innovation Center) in the United Kingdom, Osaka Welding Institute in Japan and Shanghai Jai tung University in China. The purpose of these partnerships has been to validate our own testing and benchmark our metal processing application results against incumbent technologies used in manufacturing, including for example against IR lasers, ultrasonic welding, resistance welding and tungsten inert gas welding.
 Key customers & partnerships
 Nuburu has also developed key partnerships with selective customers. We have performed hundreds of applications and thousands of test welds for customers and target customers around the world. These applications serve as a validation of customer specific application over a wide range of welding applications including batteries, consumer electronic components, heat sinks for cell phones (vapor chambers), 3C applications such as connectors, PC board interfaces, flex circuits and 3D printing.
 The first-generation AO-650 has been qualified by and is already operating in the production of vapor chambers by a key integrator in Asia. Our AO-150 is in the manufacturing qualification stage with two large systems for mask welding by an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) manufacturer in Asia. We recently also finalized a multi-year supply and license agreement for a 3D printing application with Essentium, a manufacturer of 3D printing platforms. We have delivered our AO blue laser systems to over ten large brands worldwide which have been installed on-site at our customers’ manufacturing facilities and are currently undergoing engineering and manufacturing qualification testing. Many of our existing customers have indicated interest in also testing and qualifying our new BL product line, which we launched in January 2023 and expect to begin shipping in the second quarter of 2023. A major integrator of battery welding production lines has already expressed an intent to order a BL high-power product for their development laboratory.
 Research and Development
 We conduct research and development efforts on our laser technology for new products at our headquarters in Colorado and we conduct research on applications at both our headquarters and partner facilities.
Research
 We are currently conducting research that aims to continuously improve our blue laser systems. Our laser research is concentrated in two areas: (i) creating the highest possible brightness laser from blue laser diodes and (ii) developing a single mode blue laser source.
 Nuburu has been studying numerous methods for increasing the brightness and power levels of its product line. These studies are focused on maximizing the brightness of our direct diode laser technology and include wavelength multiplexing, spectral beam combining and coherent beam combining. Nuburu is also testing numerous methods to build a single mode blue laser system with the aim of maximizing laser performance. We are currently working to scale up the output power of the latter to the industrial product levels of 100 Watts or more. A 100-Watt single mode blue laser is an ideal drop-in replacement for the single mode IR lasers currently in use in 3D printers.


Nuburu is also developing APT that uses millions of laser beams to simultaneously print a portion of a metal part in a single shot. This approach to 3D printing would allow breakthrough speeds and resolution for the parts being printed. This is because current 3D printers work by scanning a laser beam across the powder bed to fuse a very small spot of metal onto the printed part. The printing speed is limited by two factors, the amount of laser energy that can be absorbed by the metal and the speed at which the scanner can move the laser beam. These factors ultimately limit the amount of laser power that can be used and the speed at which any single scanner-based 3D printer can print. This is not the case with Nuburu’s APT, where the millions of laser beams illuminate an area that is approximately 1,000x the size of the spot typically used in a 3D printer ultimately resulting in a radically new approach to 3D printing that greatly reduces spatter and fumes that can cause defects in the parts being produced. We believe that multiple parts can be produced simultaneously on a single build plate without the issue of defects and further, that very large parts can be printed without concerns over part integrity. Nuburu is currently engaged in a project funded by the Air Force Research Labs through the AFWERX program to develop this large-scale, high-speed 3D printer.
 Nuburu’s APT’s uses Texas Instruments Digital Light Projector (DLP) to create a blue laser image on the powder bed with millions of pixel resolution. These devices were designed for large movie theaters and as a result they can handle high blue laser power levels. This provides the ability to create an image on a powder bed that is over 1,000x the size of the spots used today but with sufficient power density to fuse the powder layer by layer into a 3D printed part. The result is higher printing speeds with 0.050mm of resolution in the image from each laser print engine. Multiple laser print engines can be used within a single printer to further increase the printing speed providing a path to 10-20kg/hr printing rates or higher depending on the size of the system. The laser light engine for this type of printer consists of an AO 650H laser, a collimating and homogenizing system, the DLP spatial light modulator and a reimaging system. The AO-650H provides 650 Watts of laser power through a 400µm core optical fiber and a narrow laser bandwidth. Printer tests are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2023.
 Product Development
 Nuburu’s current product development activities are focused on the BL product line, which we have started to bring to the industrial laser marketplace in 2023. This product consists of a high brightness 250-Watt laser system. This product along with its manufacturing method have been under development since 2017 at Nuburu. The development of this system encompasses the design of the laser, its electronics and an automated manufacturing capability. Since Nuburu is focused on developing laser modules with individual laser sources, the only economical method to manufacture these systems is to fully automate the production process. Nuburu has invested in all of the equipment to accomplish this goal resulting in a pilot production line that is intended to be scalable. This module forms the basis for the multi-mode product line extending from 250 Watts to multi-kWs of laser power. This modularity means that the system output power can be rapidly scaled from today’s single module system to a system that would encompass 16 modules and produce over 4-5kW of laser power. Nuburu has designed all of the mechanical components and electronic components with system scalability in mind. This modular design approach means that the next generation of higher power products that are needed to address a broad market need can be rapidly and efficiently developed.
Intellectual Property
 Nuburu currently has over 190 granted and pending patents (of which more than 30 are in the United States and the remainder are foreign), including patents and applications directed to blue laser applications such as welding, blue laser technologies, single mode blue laser technologies, blue Raman laser technologies, addressable array technologies, and 3D printing using blue lasers. A number of its patent applications also relate to APT, electronic manufacturing, battery manufacturing and other blue laser applications. These patents are at various stages of review. Our currently issued patents are expected to expire at various times between 2034 and 2039.
 Nuburu’s practice is to apply for patent protection in key countries worldwide and to date we have been successful at securing patents in the United States and other countries. Our foreign rights include protections in Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, China and Russia. Our patent portfolio is regularly updated with new provisional applications, regular utility applications and international and foreign applications, as well as with continuing patent applications being filed as patents are granted to keep the patent families active and to extend our portfolio coverage.
 We currently do not license any patents.
 Proprietary active alignment
 The Nuburu design approach requires extremely precise alignment. The need to maintain precision alignment typically represents a challenge for optical systems intended for use in production environments, but we have developed proprietary active and automated alignment technology that solves this challenge and streamlines laser assembly and leads to robust and reliable performance in the field. That built-in robustness leads to long-term laser output power stability over thousands of hours of operation. Proprietary alignment technology also allows for a modular design approach, which enables both scalable product designs and straightforward production line maintenance. We believe that the active alignment that we have achieved would be very difficult to replicate.
 Proprietary single mode technology
 In conjunction with the proprietary design of the AO- and BL-series lasers, we hold patents and patent applications for an additional and further breakthrough in technology key to the next generation blue lasers. This technology enables a high-power single mode blue laser. Single mode laser performance provides the ultimate laser beam with the lowest angular divergence and the highest possible power density. This laser can be focused to a smaller spot size than an infrared laser and is the basis for Nuburu’s next generation single laser 3D printer design. In addition, when the single mode laser is combined with an optical scanner, it becomes possible to rapidly weld parts at a considerable distance. Since a blue laser has a substantially lower beam divergence than an IR laser, the standoff distance can be increased, or the spot size can be decreased to increase the precision of the welding process. We expect this ongoing development to position Nuburu as a leader in next-generation blue industrial lasers for the foreseeable future.
 Competition


The laser system industry in which we operate has significant price and technological competition. We compete directly with mature competitors such as Coherent, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Laserline GmbH, Lumentum Holdings Inc., Raycus Fiber Laser Technologies Co., Ltd. and Trumpf SE + Co. KG, which are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition, which we do not have. However, we also compete with development-stage companies such as TeraDiode Inc. and others. A number of these competitors are seeking to improve conventional IR lasers or to develop new laser technologies, including blue laser technology. We also compete not only with companies providing conventional lasers, but also with companies offering non-laser solutions for the applications we target. Examples of current technologies used or expected to be used in welding and 3D printing applications include:
 Infrared Fiber and Disc Lasers: Infrared lasers are the current predominant incumbent technology. However, when used on reflective material, the laser intensity must be increased to a level where the metal vaporizes, which creates spatter on the surface and pores in the weld itself. A higher intensity also results in a smaller spot size and smaller melt area. In order to increase the melt area a scan head is used to “wobble” the beam in a pattern on the workpiece. This technique still creates a weld with excessive porosity and spatter. In addition, the need for a scan head for wobbling increases weld time by up to 10x compared with blue and the capital cost of the scan head and driving software is substantial.
 Infrared Fiber Ring Lasers: Another way to improve the absorption of infrared wavelength into reflective material is to increase the temperature of the material prior to welding. A specially developed custom fiber laser or processing head is used to produce a ring of laser light around the main processing beam. This enables pre-heating of the metal before the processing beam. This is still a keyhole process but with some reduction in the heat input. However, this method also produces spatter in the melt area and voids in the weld. This approach also increases the cost of the equipment, as additional power is required. In some cases, two lasers are used, which further increases costs. The resulting process relies on a very precise balance of power in the ring and core and can be difficult to maintain in a production environment. Whilst the ring output approach can show acceptable results in thicker sections it still struggles in foil welding and fine feature applications.
 Green Lasers: A more recent introduction in the laser market is the green laser, which can be generated from both a fiber laser and a solid-state laser by using a method called frequency doubling. A non-linear crystal is used to change the color of the laser from the IR to the green. These high-power green lasers are relatively new to the market and are still under evaluation by customers for 3D printing and welding applications. However, green lasers have significant drawbacks. While the wavelength is closer to blue and improvement in absorption is seen compared with IR lasers in typically reflective materials, the improvement is not as large as with blue. Typically, a 20% improvement in absorption is seen in blue compared with green. But the most significant drawback of green lasers is their complexity and poor electrical conversion efficiency. An optical technique known as “frequency doubling” is used to take the output of an IR laser and convert the output to green (i.e., a 2kW IR laser is used to make a 1kW green laser). This requires an additional process of putting the IR beam through a crystal. This is complicated, inefficient and the conversion crystal is considered a consumable, which requires frequent maintenance or replacement due to the deterioration of the non-linear crystals. These characteristics increase the capital and running costs for the manufacturer and also compromise the reliability of the green lasers.
 Other Blue Lasers: In general, blue lasers based on an array of diodes in a bar produce lower brightness compared to individual devices because of the limitations of the spacing of the diodes on the bar array. In general, bar arrays thus result in a larger spot size or shorter standoff distance than could easily be achieved with individual devices such as our single chip approach used in our BL line of products. There is one company we are aware of that is developing blue laser diode bar technology that overcomes this limitation, but we believe this company’s beam quality is still limited to the multi-mode brightness of the individual laser diode source which would compete with our single mode BL line of products. We believe that our single mode laser greatly exceeds the performance of any of the direct diode laser beam combination methods that we are aware of.
 While there are various competing laser technologies all seeking to disrupt the IR laser’s current foothold in various applications, we believe Nuburu’s blue-laser technology is the superior approach. The cost of our blue laser technology is currently greater than that of most conventional IR laser systems and that some potential customers may prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions. However, we believe that our blue laser technology has the potential to offer our customers a greater return on investment. Nuburu’s blue laser fundamentally improves absorption rates and allows a melting process with no vaporization, which generally results in improved stable, high-quality welds and printed products, with minimal voids and spatter, all achieved using less energy and at increased speeds. We believe that Nuburu blue laser technology offers a superior solution to improving a variety of aspects of welding and 3D printing, providing customers with a broader range of applications than currently possible.
 In addition to the technical aspects outlined above, we believe principal competitive factors include technology capabilities, materials, process and application know-how, cost of operation, product reliability and the ability to provide a full range of products to meet customer needs. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to provide high-quality products, introduce new products to meet evolving customer needs and market opportunities, and extend our technologies to new applications.
 Government Regulation and Compliance
 We are subject to regulations governing the safe operation of our blue laser products. The lasers we produce are listed as Class IV lasers according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Disease and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) and must meet all government guidelines for safe operation. Each laser system design must be registered with the CDRH prior to its release to the marketplace. Nuburu lasers also receive the CE mark (signaling that we have checked that our products meet applicable EU safety, health and environmental requirements) once they pass all of the CE certification testing on safety and radiofrequency emissions. This mark is required by most foreign countries to allow them to import our products.
 Nuburu is also subject to the export regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”). We have worked with BIS to classify our current suite of products, and we intend to classify each of our new products prior to releasing them. Nuburu also has established an export manual that clearly articulates our policies and procedures used to confirm that we are in compliance with

applicable U.S. export regulations. All of our employees and distributors worldwide are required to confirm that they will adhere to these policies. Nuburu expects to update its policy and export manual from time to time to reflect any changes required by new export controls or developments in best practices. Currently, neither our AO nor our BL lasers require an export license to export to the list of countries that U.S. companies are permitted to export to. As part of our export process, we check the government’s consolidated screen list before we accept orders or ship lasers to ensure that none of the parties involved are prohibited parties.
 Sales and Marketing
 Given the size, complexity and value of our blue laser technology, our sales to date have come from long-term discussions between our management team and our current customers. Based on our experiences so far, we expect the approximate adoption timelines of our customers from first contact to first purchase order to range up to 22-24 months. Going forward, we intend to expand our marketing efforts and as we pursue a more widespread adoption of our blue laser technology.
 We have developed and trained and expect to continue to develop and train third-party distributors that provide sales and customer support functions in their specific territory, including business development and sales, application and service support and local marketing. Our distributors are and are expected to be an integral part of our sales and marketing strategy. The Americas region is managed from our headquarters, but we have distributor partners located in key countries worldwide to help target current and prospective customers in Asia (particularly in China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, India and Taiwan) and in Europe.
 Our applications lab is key to our sales effort because it allows our customers to test our full range of products to explore various application capabilities and better understand how our lasers might help them address their most challenging manufacturing problems. Our technical team provides on-site support through installation and offers technical support and training to our customers.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, Nuburu had 39 full-time employees. A significant number of our employees have a technical background and hold advanced engineering or scientific degrees. We are committed to being an employer of choice through increasing diversity in the workforce and building and maintaining a positive and inclusive culture. We view our human capital investments as crucial for our success.Our work environment is highly collaborative and one that is based on trust and mutual respect. Our team is comprised of highly skilled engineers who take substantial pride and ownership in their work. We take pride in our transparent approach to communicating, whether internally with employees or externally with our partners and customers.
 To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 We anticipate that in order to reach our strategic objectives, we will be required to recruit and retain additional management, human resources, accounting, finance, technical, engineering and sales personnel.
