ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



The Company is dedicated to: (1) advancing access to clinical trial research; and (2) improving and simplifying access to vaccines and pharmaceutical products. Currently the Company provides these services through its portfolio companies, Clinical Research Alliance, Inc. (“CRA”), and Worker’s Health Rx (d/b/a “Vitality Rx”).



Our vision for the Company is to continue to grow by acquiring controlling interests in healthcare-related businesses with strong leadership teams, innovative products and services, and proven technologies or processes that expand access to high quality healthcare and improve overall health outcomes and physical well-being. Our goal at Optimus is to empower physicians and patients with the information, guidance and tools needed to make informed health care choices. The Company seeks synergies among its portfolio companies and facilitates access to its management team which has extensive industry experience and its network of financial and business partners to help finance growth and accelerate business market trajectories.



Clinical Research Alliance



On December 28, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests in Optimus Healthcare Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Optimus”), in exchange for 9,998,899 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock and 18,000,000 shares of its common stock. In connection with the transaction all prior officers and directors of the Company (except director Michael Pruitt) resigned and new officers and directors were appointed as officers and directors of the Company. On November 25, 2020, Clinical Research Alliance Acquisition Corp. (“CRAAC”), an entity 99% owned by Optimus, acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CRA in exchange for 70 shares of its common stock.



CRA provides services to a world-class team of dedicated oncologists across the Tri-State area that are united by a shared commitment to conduct clinical research. CRA provides independent, community-based oncology practices and hospitals in diverse communities with the necessary infrastructure and support to enroll their patients in cutting edge clinical trials without the patients having to leave their physicians’ offices, hospitals or their local communities.



CRA currently supports a number of community-based practices and has signed an agreement with its first acute care hospital in Brooklyn, NY. CRA’s current focus is on oncology practices, as well as hospitals in diverse communities.



CRA contracts with pharmaceutical companies and Contract Research Organizations (“CRO”) to conduct clinical trials (Phases I-IV) for investigational new drugs, biologics and medical devices, and has worked with over 40 pharmaceutical companies since inception. CRA’s customers consist primarily of large and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In the last 12 years, CRA has helped conduct approximately 180 clinical trials. As CRA was the highest enroller in many of these clinical trials, many of those clinical trials led to FDA approval for the trial compounds used to treat various cancers. Depending on the clinical trial design, CRA invoices the pharmaceutical manufacturer for some or all of the following services: startup fees, diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, patient stipends, pharmacy fees, patient visits, document storage and the reporting of serious adverse events.



CRA also contracts with community-based oncology practices and hospitals in diverse communities to assist in the conduct of clinical trials. CRA’s services to the community-based oncology practices and hospitals in diverse communities include:




(1) | maintaining the documentation necessary for the conduct of the clinical trial;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | obtaining Internal Review Board (“IRB”) approval;
----+--------------------------------------------------


(3) | collecting data required by the clinical trial protocol;
----+---------------------------------------------------------


(4) | filing regulatory and compliance related documentation; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | dispensing drugs necessary to conduct the clinical trial.
----+----------------------------------------------------------

Our contracts with the community-based oncology practices and hospitals include specific budgets for particular services rendered. The contracts may range in duration from a few months to several years or longer depending on the nature of the work performed. In most cases, a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the contract is executed with the balance of the contract fee payable either monthly or in installments upon the achievement of milestones over the clinical trial duration. Our contracts generally may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon short notice. Our contracts with our community-based oncology practices and hospitals result in the payment of fees for services rendered to the principal investigator that is conducting a particular clinical trial. The COVID-19 pandemic did not impact any open trials that were ongoing as CRA was able to conduct business remotely instead of through on-site visits. However, it did impact the number of new trials that were initiated in 2020 and 2021. The number of oncology trials rebounded in 2022.



CRA employs experienced Clinical Research Coordinators that travel to the community-based oncology practices and hospitals for required study visits. Additionally, CRA’s principal investigator for a specific clinical trial is in contact with the oncology practices and hospitals to provide the necessary oversight. Community-based oncology practices and hospitals choose CRA because we provide the opportunity to conduct and conveniently enroll their patients in important clinical trials often unavailable to those community-based practices and hospitals. In addition, CRA is committed to increasing clinical trial access to patients from diverse and underserved communities that will better represent the real-world population. Although CRA’s historical focus has been in the area of oncology, in the future we intend to expand our therapeutic reach into other therapeutic areas, including possibly gastroenterology, dermatology, cardiology, urology and ophthalmology. The National Institutes of Health estimate that there are currently 126,164 active clinical studies in these therapeutic areas.



The clinical research industry is fragmented, consisting of many small, niche service providers, a number of medium-sized providers and a number of large CROs that are differentiated by the scale of their global operations, breadth of service portfolios and supporting technology infrastructure. Companies like CRA generally compete on the basis of previous product experience, the ability to recruit patients, the depth of therapeutic and scientific expertise, the strength of project teams, price and increasingly on the ability to apply new innovation that can drive significant time and cost savings throughout the development process.



On May 1, 2020, CRA entered into a note agreement for an aggregate principal amount of $146,250 with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan Chase”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) (the “2020 PPP Loan”). On February 19, 2021, CRA entered into a note agreement for an aggregate principal amount of $148,975 with JPMorgan Chase under the CARES Act administered by the SBA (the “2021 PPP Loan” and together with the 2020 PPP Loan, the “PPP Loans”). CRA received total aggregate proceeds of $295,225 under the PPP Loans. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, CRA used proceeds from the PPP Loans primarily for payroll costs. The 2020 PPP Loan was scheduled to mature on May 1, 2021 and the 2021 PPP Loan was scheduled to mature on February 19, 2022, each with a 1% interest rate and subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. $126,545.50 of the 2020 PPP Loan was forgiven on March 26, 2021. The remaining balance of $19,136.50 of the 2020 PPP Loan was not forgiven because an employee was terminated during the period. This amount is due in five years and is being repaid on a monthly basis. The 2021 PPP Loan was fully forgiven on November 3, 2021.



PainScript



On March 25, 2021, Optimus Health, Inc. (“Optimus Health”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests in AdhereRx Corporation (d/b/a PainScript) (“PainScript”) in exchange for an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, including shares issuable upon satisfaction of certain milestones. On December 28, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the stock acquisition agreement by and among the Company, Optimus Health, PainScript and Daniel Cohen, pursuant to which we agreed to modify the commercial milestones which needed to be achieved for the release of 400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to be equal to: (i) the generation of at least $80,000 in aggregate revenue between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022; or (ii) between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the entry into one or more commercial enterprise contracts that will generate revenue during their term not less than $200,000 from commercial sales of the Chronic Care Management application (a “Commercialization Success”). On April 13, 2022, we entered into a second amendment to the stock acquisition agreement by and among the Company, Optimus Health, PainScript and Daniel Cohen, pursuant to which we agreed that upon a Commercialization Success and the Company’s receipt of revenue in excess of $200,000 from the commercial enterprise contracts entered into in connection with such Commercialization Success or a Change of Control (as defined therein), the Company shall release the 400,000 shares of Company common stock to the PainScript shareholders.



On December 7, 2022, the Company entered into a stock acquisition agreement (the “Dec 2022 Agreement”) by and among the Company, Optimus Health, PainScript and certain shareholders of the Company pursuant to which the Company agreed to exchange 100% of the outstanding shares of PainScript for 1,600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which shares were then cancelled. The transactions contemplated by the Dec 2022 Agreement closed on December 15, 2022. In connection with the closing of the Dec 2022 Agreement, the 400,000 earnout shares issued to the former shareholders of PainScript were also cancelled. In addition, at closing, the Company provided a loan in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000 to PainScript to cover employee liabilities and general working capital. The loan bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and matures on the one-year anniversary of the original issuance date. To date, interest payments have been made on a timely basis. The loan is secured by a pledge of a majority of the voting capital stock of PainScript held by certain PainScript shareholders. The Company also contributed $100,000 to PainScript in order to cover outstanding liabilities.

Vitality Rx



On January 28, 2022, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Worker’s Health Rx, Inc., d/b/a Vitality Rx (“Vitality Rx”) and Marc Wiener, the sole shareholder, who is also our President, pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Vitality Rx in exchange for the issuance of 250,000 shares of our common stock and $350,000. The cash portion of the purchase price has been paid in full. 



Vitality Rx is an early-stage pharmacy dedicated to serving the pharmacy needs of patients in the community and residing in Assisted Living and Independent Living facilities throughout the tristate area.  The pharmacy anticipates maintaining an inventory of brand and generic medications needed to meet the needs of this population. In addition, Vitality Rx is exploring the possibility of providing intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”) to physician offices in the community: including but not limited to: neurologists, Ob/Gyn & infectious disease.  This offering is in a preliminary stage as a business plan is being constructed. 



Government Regulation



Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations.



In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities loosened or removed a number of regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period.



Regulation of Drugs and Biologics



The development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution and post-approval monitoring and reporting of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). These regulations apply to our customers and are generally applicable to us when we are providing services to our customers, either as a result of their direct applicability, through a transfer of regulatory obligations from our customers, or as a consequence of acting as local legal representative on behalf of our customers in a particular country or countries. Consequently, we must comply with all relevant laws and regulations in the conduct of our clinical research services. The following discussion describes the role of the FDA in the clinical drug development process in the United States. Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protections of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other materials. FDA laws and regulations may apply to clinical studies conducted outside the United States if, for example, such studies are conducted under an investigational new drug application (“IND”) or offered as support for an IND. However, some regions and countries do not allow for clinical trials to be conducted under foreign country legislation. Therefore, the FDA may waive certain requirements such as the institutional review board (“IRB”) requirements for a foreign institutional review board/independent ethics committee (“IRB/IEC”) that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) but may not meet may not meet all the IRB requirements contained in Title 21 Part 56 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations.



Prior to commencing human clinical trials in the United States, a company developing a new drug must file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The IND must include information about pre-clinical tests, manufacturing and control data, and a study protocol for the proposed clinical trial of the drug in humans. If the FDA does not object in writing within 30 days after filing, the IND becomes effective and the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with an effective IND. Similarly, the development of new medical devices in the United States requires an investigational device exemption application (“IDE”), unless exempt, prior to conducting human clinical trials. For therapeutic and diagnostic products that combine drugs, devices, and/or biological products, these are considered combination products. The FDA will make a determination based on the prior mode of action as to which FDA center will take the lead on the review. Nonetheless, due to the nature of combination products, there can still be differences in regulatory pathways for each component. These differences can impact regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including pre-clinical tests, clinical studies, manufacturing and control data as well as adverse event reporting.





3







The study protocol must also be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (“IRB”) for each principal investigator’s site in which a study is proposed to be conducted and each IRB may impose additional requirements on the conduct of the study in its institution. IRB have the authority to review, approve and monitor clinical trials, and clinical trials are subject to oversight by IRB. The industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials is embodied in the FDA’s regulations for IRB, investigators and sponsor/monitors, which regulations collectively are termed Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) by industry. GCP requirements address, among other things, IRBs, qualified investigators, informed consent, recordkeeping and reporting. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP requirements through periodic inspections, and violations of GCP requirements could result in enforcement actions including the issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, product recalls, criminal prosecutions or debarment from involvement in the submission of New Drug Applications/Biologics License Applications (“NDAs” and “BLAs,” respectively). Our global standard operating procedures are written in accordance with all applicable FDA and GCP requirements. This enables our work to be conducted locally to standards that meet all currently applicable regulatory requirements. We must also maintain records and documentation in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for each study for auditing by the customer and regulatory authorities.



If a clinical trial is not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the applicable regulatory agency may require that a clinical trial be modified, suspended or terminated, and we or our customers may be subject to a variety of sanctions. For example, violations could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning or untitled letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. IRBs may also suspend or terminate research not conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.



After receiving IRB approval, clinical trials usually start on a small scale to assess safety and then expand to larger trials to test both efficacy and safety in the target population. The trials are generally conducted in three phases (Phases I, II and III), which may overlap or be combined, although the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily conduct, a fourth phase of clinical trials (Phase IV) as a condition of approval or to obtain additional data on the product under investigation, respectively. After the successful completion of the first three clinical phases, a company requests approval for marketing its product by submitting an NDA for a drug or a BLA for a biologic product. NDAs/BLAs are comprehensive filings that include, among other things, the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about how the product will be manufactured, additional stability data and proposed labeling.



Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines



The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretation.



Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the U.S.; Fee Splitting



We contract with physicians or physician owned professional associations and professional corporations to provide access to our platform and services to them and their patients. We have entered into management services contracts that outline the nature of our relationships with them, and they pay us for those services via management and other service fees. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas and California, that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and that are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing a physician’s professional judgment. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine.



State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or administrative penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.

U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws



Federal Stark Law



We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients for “designated health services” such as laboratory and radiology services that are furnished at an entity if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $172,137 for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute



We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $104,330 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of more than $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the OIG has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.



Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter, it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws.



False Claims Act



Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs.

State Fraud and Abuse Laws



Several states in which we operate have also adopted or may adopt similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by Medicaid programs and any third-party payer, including commercial insurers or to any payer, including to funds paid out of pocket by a patient. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Other Healthcare Laws



HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payers of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payers as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs.



In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts, and statutory or common law fraud.



U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws



There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. AMG, our health system clients, and our health plan clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. We are a business associate of our covered entity clients when we are working on behalf of our covered entity clients including our affiliated medical groups and also when we are providing technology services to those clients via our telehealth platform. As a business associate, we are also directly regulated by HIPAA and are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to our covered entity clients through written business associate agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with HIPAA. Failure to comply with these contractual agreements could lead to loss of clients, contractual liability to our clients, and direct action by HHS, including monetary penalties.



Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. The civil penalties include civil monetary penalties of up to $59,552 per violation, not to exceed approximately $1.8 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year (as of 2020, and subject to periodic adjustments for inflation), and in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. Our management responsibilities to AMG include assisting it with its obligations under HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. HIPAA also requires a business associate to notify its covered entity clients of breaches by the business associate.





6







State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.



HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards for electronic transactions that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. On January 16, 2009, HHS released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by HIPAA must implement ICD 10 for medical coding on October 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended to October 1, 2015 and is now in effect.



Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but, unlike HIPAA, some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.



In addition to HIPAA and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security acts or practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. The FTC and states’ attorneys general have brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and similar state laws.



In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials and provide credit monitoring services and/or other relevant services to impacted individuals. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our clients who are covered entities, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.



Intellectual Property
