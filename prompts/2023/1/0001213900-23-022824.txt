Item 1. Business
Overview of Business



Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “AGAE,” “Allied” and the “Company” refer to Allied Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries.



Allied is a global experiential entertainment company focused on providing a growing audience of gamers with unique experiences through renowned assets, products, and services. Prior to July 2021, the Company owned and operated World Poker Tour (“WPT”) businesses and Allied Esports business. On July 12, 2021, the Company completed its sale of its business comprising the WPT business for gross proceeds of approximately $106 million. As of December 31 2022, the Company’s operation includes Allied Esports International, which owns and operates HyperX Arena Las Vegas, one of the world’s most recognized esports and entertainment events facilities, two mobile arenas-Allied Esports Trucks, and original content studio which creates and produces proprietary content series to serve brand activation and promotion, fans and community engagement. The Company offers a variety of esports and gaming-related content, including world class tournaments, live and virtual entertainment and gaming events, and original programming to continuously foster an engaged gaming community. In December 2022, the Company completed a strategic review of its business operations and announced plans to restructure the existing esports business and expand its focus to include a broader array of entertainment and gaming products and services. Under this plan, the Company intends to pursue multiple channels of opportunities instead of a single significant corporate transaction such as an acquisition of complimentary assets or businesses, and it is currently exploring opportunities to leverage its location-based-entertainment expertise with a focus on gaming lifestyle and experiential entertainment, as well as growing its digital footprint and monetization capabilities through mobile gaming.



The entertainment industry has witnessed the rapid growth of gaming, which now ranks among the largest and fastest-growing markets. As of 2021, with a staggering 3.1 billion gamers worldwide, the global gaming industry was valued at $202.64 billion and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% between 2022 and 2023. Mobile gaming and esports are the major driver of this exponentially growing market. Esports, an abbreviation of “electronic sports,” encompasses a diverse range of competitive electronic games that are played by gamers against each other. Popular esports games include Fortnite, League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Overwatch, and FIFA. Unlike the traditional video games where players can play alone against the computer or console, esports has evolved to include a community and spectator aspect. Competitive gameplay against another person, either individually or in teams, viewed by an online and in-person audience, has become a central feature of esports. Additionally, game developers have greatly increased the watchability of games, which has made the spectator aspect of gaming much more prevalent and further drives expansion of the gaming market. Esports has now become so popular that many colleges offer scholarships in esports and the best-known esports teams are receiving mainstream sponsorships and are being bought or invested in by celebrities, athletes and professional sports teams. The highest profile esports gamers have significant online audiences as they stream themselves playing against other players online and potentially can generate millions of dollars in sponsorship money and subscription fees from their online streaming channels. Meanwhile, the industry of watching other people play video games continues to surge in popularity. In 2022, the games live-streaming audience grew by 14.5% year over year to 927.3 million (Newzoo report). It is estimated that this category will reach 1.21 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of +12.7%. For years to come, infrastructure development and the growth of mobile esports will be the key drivers in emerging regions, while the diversification of content is likely to drive viewing behavior in western markets.



Allied will continue to use a three-pillar strategy in its gaming and entertainment services; in-person experiences, multiplatform content, and interactive services both independently and in connection with its strategic partners.



Our Growth Strategies



In-person Experiences



With its world class gaming and live broadcasting equipped facilities, Hyper X Arena Las Vegas, Allied will continue delivering first-in-class live experiences to customers which will allow them to compete against other players in world esports competitions, to host live events with influencers that potentially stream to millions of viewers worldwide with unprecedently engaged experience, to produce and distribute incredible entertainment content with its on-site production facilities and studios. Allied’s flagship HyperX Arena Las Vegas serves as a marquee destination for esports fans globally and has become one of the most recognized esports and live entertainment venues in the world. Additionally, Allied has two mobile esports arenas, which are 18-wheel semi-trailers that convert into first class esports arenas and competition stages with full content production capabilities and interactive talent studios. Through our renowned assets, Allied believes it can offer customers an unmatched ability to participate in simultaneous global esports events and offer sponsors and partners a truly scalable global platform and audience to promote their businesses and products.

Flagship Arena. In March 2018, Allied opened its first flagship arena, the HyperX Arena Las Vegas, at the Luxor Hotel & Casino on the Vegas strip, whose pyramid is one of the most visible landmarks in Las Vegas. This arena has over 130 gaming stations, two bars, food service, private rooms, an unmatched full-scale broadcast and production facility, and space for up to 1,000 people for events. The arena is custom-built for esports tournaments and has a broadcast-ready television studio to broadcast live events and produce content. Allied monetizes the arena through hosting or renting the space for live events; merchandise sales; daily usage fees from day-to-day gamers using the gaming stations; tournament entry and player venue fees; food and beverage; and a long-term sponsorship (i.e., our HyperX naming rights relationship).



Affiliate Arenas. One of Allied’s strategic advantages is its global network of esports arena partners, which enables it to host events and promote competitions around the world, with those competitions culminating in live events held at the flagship arena in Las Vegas. Allied achieves this through its Affiliate Program, which consists of strategic partnerships with third-party esports operators around the globe. Allied generally charges these affiliates an upfront fee and a minimal annual revenue share of gross revenue, starting in the second year of the operation of the venue. Allied’s brand visibility and reputation have already resulted in affiliate arrangements with arenas and gaming centers in China and a multi-year agreement with Fortress Esports Pty Ltd, a new gaming, esports and entertainment venue enterprise in Australia, which opened its first affiliate arena in Melbourne in March 2020 and reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2021. This network of affiliate arenas allows Allied to scale its brand penetration worldwide on a rapid basis, driving more gamers into the Allied ecosystem, with minimal costs to Allied. Furthermore, the content produced by these affiliate arenas can be sold by Allied, with minimal production costs.



Mobile Arenas. The mobile arenas are 18-wheeler trucks that expand out into fully functional esports arenas with event hosting, broadcasting and production capabilities. The mobility of the trucks makes them ideal for sponsors to reach a large audience in multiple locations at an economical cost. The trucks serve as mobile billboards for potential third-party sponsorship, as well as the Allied brand, providing highly visible brand presence wherever they appear.



Multiplatform Content



Built upon state-of-the-art unique facilities and a growing gamers community, Allied continues to produce successful gamers centric original content programing. Allied’s original content series Elevated, designed to help up-and-coming Twitch streamers break through the clutter, get discovered and grow their audiences, has brought in more than 10 million live viewers and 3 million VOD views over 4 episodes during its Season 1 debut in March of 2022. The series was renewed for Season 2 with stronger support from our brand partner Progressive Insurance, by doubling the production and expanded to 10 episodes for Season 2, which will air in Q2 2023. Allied has also signed a multi-year, multi-episode content partnership with the YES Network to produce original series Wannabe, which explores the journeys of professional gamers and professional athletes who have appeared on the YES Network, all of whom have a strong passion for esports and competitive gaming, and the common themes between their different careers. Each episode delves into the early dreams of these individuals and traces their paths to success. This highly entertaining original content series continues to strengthen our brand engagement, expand our fans out-reach, and build up multi-channel monetization through sponsorship, advertisement, and distribution.



We believe Allied’s ecosystem of esports branded properties gives it the reach, reputation and experience to produce world-class live events, in partnership with some of the most prominent names in the esports and entertainment industry. These live events provide Allied with the material to produce exciting content that can be distributed via three different formats, each of which has its own revenue generation model: live streaming, post-produced episodic content, and short-form repackaged content.



Live Streaming. According to a report by Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet, in 2022, viewers watched a total of 29.5 billion hours of live gaming content on popular streaming platforms such as Twitch, Youtube Gaming, and Facebook Gaming. This represents a decrease of 13.5% from the previous year’s 34.0 billion hours, which may be attributed in part to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the subsequent recovery of live events and travel. Twitch is the most popular form of esports content delivery channel today, as it offers the best interactive experiences for the audience. Vast improvements in technology and Internet service and speed have made live streaming with large audiences widely available today. Well-known gamers live stream themselves playing their favorite games on any of the popular streaming services (Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming, etc.) to a worldwide audience. The streamers derive revenue from ad sales, sponsorship, subscription fees and gift payments from spectators. Through Allied’s ecosystem of esports arenas, Allied can offer streamers a large platform to put on live events that can be simultaneously streamed on both the streamer’s channels and on Allied’s channels.

Post-Produced Episodic Content. Allied continues to develop esports entertainment programming around its live experiences and, using its experienced editing and production teams, create serial, episodic content and segments that tell compelling storylines around its gaming talent, in person experiences, and gaming events around the world. Allied draws from its knowledge and experience in developing WPT, which took the slow-paced game of poker and dramatized it and created storylines that made for exciting and compelling viewing. This post-produced content can be valuable real estate for sponsors, as Allied can integrate sponsors seamlessly into the show in a way that feels organic to the viewers. Allied can focus on different storylines, create excitement via editing and music inclusion, and generally elevate the production quality from that achievable in a live stream. Allied can then monetize this episodic content via sponsorship, advertising, selling the content itself to third party distributors, or even use it as a marketing tool to drive customers to come to Allied’s branded properties, buy its merchandise or otherwise interact with Allied.
Short-Form Repackaged Content. The library of content Allied will develop from events can be cut into smaller clips that can be used as marketing and promotion of the Allied brand on social media. Allied can also edit content to create new content, such as “best of” shows, focusing on one particular game as played by multiple well-known streamers, regional shows focusing on talent from a particular country, and so on.



Allied’s global branded esports properties ecosystem will create opportunities for live events which provide material to develop great content, all of which Allied can monetize in multiple ways. The large customer base Allied develops through these in-person experiences, live streams and content distribution will give it a customer base to launch interactive services.



Interactive services



Newzoo’s consumer research reveals that active engagement is becoming increasingly popular across all generations, with consumers spending nearly 15 hours per week engaging with games. Allied is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend by leveraging its unique physical assets, such as the HyperX Arena Las Vegas and Allied Esports Trucks’ live events and broadcasting capabilities, as well as its technology partnerships.



The Company aims to become the world’s leading live/virtual interactive space for content creators and broadcasters, with a particular emphasis on direct audience monetization through online ticket sales. Allied is working with various streaming technology partners to provide hyper-engaged, real-time interactive streaming experiences to a wide range of influencers, including YouTubers, Twitch streamers, podcasters, and sports stars.



By focusing on delivering highly interactive and engaging experiences to its audiences, Allied can unlock new revenue streams and provide a platform for influencers to monetize their content more effectively. With the potential for significant growth in the coming years, Allied is well-positioned to become a key player in the rapidly evolving world of interactive content monetization.

Competition



The esports gaming industry is competitive. Competitors range from established leagues and championships owned directly, as well as leagues franchised by well-known and capitalized game publishers and developers, interactive entertainment companies, diversified media companies and emerging start-ups.
