Overview
 
We are a provider and manager of value-based, conservative medical care combining life science advancements with traditional medical care for movement-restricting diseases and conditions in IMAC Regeneration Centers and BackSpace clinics. Our Innovative Medical Advancements and Care (IMAC) Regeneration Centers combine medical and physical procedures to improve patient experiences and outcomes and reduce healthcare costs as compared to other available treatment options. As of December 31, 2022, we own three and manage seven outpatient clinics that provide regenerative, orthopedic and minimally invasive procedures and therapies. Our treatments are performed by licensed medical practitioners through our regenerative rehabilitation protocols designed to improve the physical health, to advance the quality of life and to lessen the pain of our patients. We do not prescribe opioids, but instead offer an alternative to conventional surgery or joint replacement surgery by delivering minimally invasive medical treatments to help patients with sports injuries, back pain, knee pain, joint pain, ligament and tendon damage, and other related soft tissue conditions. Our employees focus on providing exceptional customer service to give our patients a memorable and caring experience. We believe that we have priced our treatments to be affordable by 95% of the population and are well positioned in the expanding regenerative medical sector.

Our licensed healthcare professionals provide each patient a custom treatment plan that integrates innovative regenerative medicine protocols (representing 9% of our revenue) with traditional, minimally invasive (minimizing skin punctures) medical procedures (representing 63% of our revenue) in combination with physical therapies (representing 22% of our revenue), chiropractic care (representing 5% of our revenue) and the remaining 1% of our revenue from memberships. We do not use or offer opioid-based prescriptions as part of our treatment options in order to help our patients avoid the dangers of opioid abuse and addiction. We have successfully treated patients that were previously addicted to opioids because of joint or soft tissue related pain. Further, our procedures comply with all professional athletic league drug restriction policies, including the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB.
 
Dr. Matthew Wallis, DC, our President, opened the first IMAC Regeneration Center in Paducah, Kentucky in August 2000, which remains the flagship location of our current business. Dr. Jason Brame, DC joined Dr. Wallis in 2008. In 2015, Drs. Wallis and Brame hired Jeffrey S. Ervin as our Chief Executive Officer to collectively create and implement their growth strategy. The result was the formal creation of IMAC Holdings, Limited Liability Company (“LLC”) to expand IMAC clinics outside of western Kentucky, with such facilities to remain owned or operated under the group using the IMAC Regeneration Center name and services. In June 2018, we completed a corporate conversion in which IMAC Holdings, LLC was converted to IMAC Holdings, Inc. to consolidate ownership of existing clinics and implement our growth strategy. In February 2019, we completed an initial public offering and our shares commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
 
We are focused on providing natural, non-opioid solutions to pain as consumers increasingly demand conservative treatments for an aging population. The demand for our services continues to grow fueled by consumer preferences for organic healthcare solutions over traditionally invasive orthopedic practices. We believe that our regenerative rehabilitation treatments are provided to patients at a much lower price than our primary competitors, including orthopedic surgeons, pain management clinics and hospital systems targeting invasive joint reconstruction. Surgical joint replacements cost several times more than our therapies initially treating the same condition. The U.S. government has recently adopted strict surgery pre-approval initiatives to reduce the cost for CMS and limit the proliferation of opioids since they accompany substantially all joint replacement surgeries.

We believe patient satisfaction is driven by our five fundamental beliefs:
 

● | We believe that the body has the ability to heal itself, and better results occur with our solutions to unlock the body’s natural healing process; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe in the power of doctors, from many different specializations, working together for the best patient care possible; 
● | We believe that employees should know patients by their face, not by a chart number; 
● | We believe consumers have a choice regardless of physician referral or insurance coverage; and 
● | We believe a medical setting should be comforting. 

 
We are led by senior executive officers who together have more than 100 years of combined experience in the healthcare services industry. Jeffrey S. Ervin, co-founder of IMAC Holdings and our Chief Executive Officer, joined us in March 2015. Mr. Ervin has a history of sourcing private equity investments and managing private equity operations in the healthcare and other growth industries. Mr. Ervin earned an M.B.A. degree from Vanderbilt University. The founder of our company, Matthew C. Wallis, DC, a licensed chiropractor, is our President. Dr. Wallis has implemented strategies in the company to create consistent operating efficiencies for our sales, marketing and service delivery operations. Sheri F. Gardzina serves as our Chief Financial Officer and joined the company in November 2017. Mrs. Gardzina earned an M.B.A. and M.S. from Northeastern University and is a licensed Certified Public Accountant. Ben Lerner, DC, a licensed chiropractor, joined the team in February 2022 as our Chief Operating Officer. Dr. Lerner left the company in February 2023 to pursue other opportunities.
 
Recent Developments
 
On March 20, 2023, we announced an executed letter of intent for a strategic merger-of-equals with Brain Scientific, Inc. (OTCQB:BRSFD), a Florida-based applied science technology company. Together, the companies will provide patients with true end-to-end neurological solutions using Brain Scientific’s diagnostic and motion technologies and IMAC’s regenerative rehabilitation medical services. Hassan Kotob, Chief Executive Officer of Brain Scientific, is expected to serve as Chairman and CEO of the combined company. The details related to this merger-of-equals are still being negotiated and have not been finalized.
 
The Company believes, although there can be no assurance, that, when reported, the revenues and net earnings for the year ended December 2023 of the combined Companies will exceed those reported for 2022. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent (collectively, the “Brain Scientific Acquisition”) is subject to the execution and delivery of a definitive Share and Asset Purchase Agreement and the satisfaction of the closing conditions which will be contained therein. It is contemplated that the Brain Scientific Acquisition will be consummated in 2023, but there can be no assurance that a definitive Share and Asset Purchase Agreement will be entered into, or that the Brain Scientific Acquisition will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the letter of intent or otherwise. Additionally, there will be a number of risks attendant upon the Brain Scientific Acquisition. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Brain Scientific Acquisition”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – The Brain Scientific Acquisition” and “Business – Brain Scientific Acquisitions”.
 
Our Operations
 
As of December 31, 2022, we operated 10 outpatient medical clinics in five states and 10 BackSpace locations in three states. Given the Company’s current financial position, during the first quarter of 2023, the Company decided to close four underperforming locations and in addition sold its Louisiana Orthopedic practice as well as The BackSpace, LLC operations in an effort to raise sufficient capital to support on-going operations. Management has been actively exploring various strategic alternatives in an effort to support operations in 2023 and beyond.

Our Services
 
The licensed healthcare professionals at our clinics work with each patient to create a protocol customized for each patient by utilizing a combination of the following traditional and innovative treatments:
 
Medical Treatments. Our specialized team of doctors work together to provide the latest minimally invasive, prescription-free treatments for movement challenges or pain related to orthopedic conditions. The treatments are customized to treat the underlying condition instead of addressing the challenge with prescriptions or surgeries.
 
Regenerative Medicine. Regenerative therapy at IMAC Regeneration Centers utilizes undifferentiated cellular tissue to regenerate damaged tissue. The majority of our procedures utilize cells from the patient, harvested under minimal manipulation, and applied during the same visit to the clinic. These autologous cells help to heal degenerative soft tissue conditions, which cause pain or compromise the patient’s quality of life. Platelet therapies comprise the greatest percentage of regenerative procedures. Independent studies in this area, including a recent safety and feasibility study published by Dr. Peter B. Fodor, “Adipose Derived Stromal Cell Injections for Pain Management of Osteoarthritis in the Human Knee Joint” (Aesthetic Surgery Journal, February 2016), have supported claims that autologous cell treatments using adipose and bone marrow lead to improved function and decreased pain within joints, muscles and connective tissue and can help alleviate osteoarthritis and degenerative disease. We believe that we have followed the increasingly accepted protocols described in this and other similar studies in connection with our regenerative therapies.
 
Physical Medicine. Our team of medical practitioners start by collaboratively building a personalized physical medicine treatment plan designed to help patients get back to living the life they deserve.
 
Physical Therapy. With a combination of biomechanical loading and tissue mobilization, our licensed physical rehabilitation therapists work with each patient to help the body restore skill within the joint or soft tissue.
 
Spinal Decompression. During this treatment, the spine is stretched and relaxed intermittently in a controlled manner, creating a negative pressure in the disc area that can pull herniated or bulging tissue back into the disc. Whether caused by trauma or degeneration, we realize the impact a spinal injury can have on the quality of one’s life and are committed to providing the most innovative, minimally invasive medical technology and care to relieve back pain and restore function.

Chiropractic Manipulation. Common for spine conditions, manual manipulation is used to increase range of motion, reduce nerve irritability and improve function.
 
FDA Clinical Trial
 
In November 2017, we engaged a medical consulting group to advise us on current regenerative medicine therapy protocols and to organize a clinical trial towards an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA, while pursuing a voluntary Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation. This process is defined under Section 3033 of the 21st Century Cures Act. We intend to conduct an investigator-initiated trial utilizing regenerative advancements to alleviate symptoms of debilitating, neurological conditions and diseases. Stem cell therapy is emerging as a potentially revolutionary new way to treat disease and injury, with wide-ranging medical benefits. It aims to repair damaged and diseased body parts with Healthy new cells provided by stem cell transplants.
 
The medical consulting group has assisted us in conducting research, establishing patient engagement tools and developing clinical strategies to achieve the IND and RMAT. We executed a technology transfer agreement with a research university to license an FDA Phase I approved mesenchymal stem cell drug candidate. We submitted an IND application with the FDA using this therapeutic product in May 2020, and the FDA Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies authorized the Phase I clinical trial in August 2020. IMAC physicians were trained to administer treatments within IMAC facilities and the FDA approved opening enrollment for the trial in November 2020. The first enrollee was treated in December 2020, utilizing umbilical cord-derived allogenic mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of bradykinesia due to Parkinson’s disease. The Phase 1 clinical trial consists of a 15-patient dose escalation safety and tolerability study. The trial is divided into three groups: (1) five patients with bradykinesia due to Parkinson’s disease received a low intravenous dose, (2) five patients received a medium intravenous dose, (3) and five patients received a high intravenous dose. Each trial participant received an intravenous infusion of stem cells and will be tracked for 12 months for data collection. The final patient was dosed on September 6, 2022.
 
No assurance can be given that the FDA will approve advancement beyond a Phase I study or the RMAT designation. We believe the RMAT designation may be helpful in differentiating our services and gaining a broader collaborative connection with the FDA. Failure to earn the RMAT designation will result in unfulfilled research expenses, but should not have a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We have developed a comprehensive approach and well-defined model delivering movement-optimizing medical treatments for minimally invasive orthopedic and neurological care. We recognize that patients often have broad set of conditions that restrict their movement and we provide a comprehensive physical evaluation to target all conditions that impact someone’s ability to function optimally. The key elements of our strategy that we believe will propel our growth are:
 
Offer State-of-the-Art Orthopedic Treatments. Our regenerative rehabilitation techniques are used to prevent arthritis, treat meniscus tears, defeat muscle deterioration and address other damaged tissue conditions. We will continue offering innovative therapies and recently approved medical technologies, including alternative medicine treatments, and will adapt our treatment offerings as new treatments are developed and come to market. 
 
Provide Multi-Specialty Medical Services. We recognized consistent patterns in our patients’ deficiencies. Instead of sending the patient to other medical specialists, we have incorporated complementary medical services to our patients for added convenience and satisfaction. By bringing together a diverse array of medical specialists and services, we are able to treat more health conditions and attract a larger base of patients. For example, obesity is a significant contributor to poor orthopedic function. While not a primary service offering, we offer medical weight loss protocols to assist with alleviating joint and back pain. 
 
Advertising and Marketing
 
Our corporate advertising and marketing efforts focus on increasing our brand awareness and communicating our commitment to “success without major surgery,” along with other competitive advantages our company offers. Our marketing strategy is to offer an innovative and recently approved medical technologies for movement and orthopedic therapies that appeal to a wide range of potential patients, continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our outpatient medical services. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including digital advertising, email marketing, social media and affiliate marketing, as well as through strategic partnerships with well-known sports celebrities to build our endorsements and draw patients to our IMAC Regeneration Centers. Our celebrity endorsers appear in our press marketing and social media marketing efforts and help generate interest in our brand and services. We maintain our website at www.imacregeneration.com. Advertising and marketing expense was approximately $1,100,000 and $1,325,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
 
Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on individuals who seek to maintain, restore and maximize their health and wellness. A majority of our customers are located within 25 miles of one of our outpatient medical clinics. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.

Competition and Our Competitive Advantages
 
The outpatient physical therapy industry is highly competitive, with thousands of clinics across the country. While some of our competitors offer regenerative medical treatments as an effective treatment for degenerative health conditions, we believe that few companies have the multi-disciplinary approach of combining physical therapy and medical professionals working together to generate optimal regenerative health outcomes. One of our major competitive advantages is the ability to deliver medical treatments alongside complementary physical medicine and provide broadly affordable regenerative treatments.
 
Competitive factors affecting our business include quality of care, cost, treatment outcomes, convenience of location, and relationships with, and ability to meet the needs of, referral and insurance payor sources. Our clinics compete, directly or indirectly, with many types of healthcare providers including the physical therapy departments of hospitals, private therapy clinics, physician-owned therapy clinics, and chiropractors. We may face more intense competition if consolidation of the therapy industry continues.
 
We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a result of the following competitive strengths:
 
Our Minimally Invasive Approach to Traditional Orthopedic Care. We pay particular attention to rehabilitating our patients’ musculoskeletal system to reduce pain and enhance mobility without major surgery or anesthesia. By combining physical therapy and regenerative medicine, we are able to treat a variety of physical conditions by using a patient’s own body to help heal itself.
 
Strong Regional Presence. We own three and manage seven clinics in five states, providing us leverage for implementation of our marketing strategies and utilization of our staff. We believe we offer a broader platform of regenerative therapies than our regional competitors.
 
We Do Not Prescribe Addictive Opioids. We do not use or offer opioid-based prescriptions as part of our treatment options in order to help our patients avoid the dangers of opioid abuse and addiction. We focus on preventing the potential for addiction through our regenerative-based therapies that help alleviate chronic pain.
 
Utilizing Diverse Medical Specialists for Customized Care. Our treatment protocols are customized by a team of medical doctors, nurse practitioners, chiropractors and physical therapists and are designed to heal damaged tissue without major surgery or prescription pain medication. This team approach delivers comprehensive service while avoiding the higher costs of major reconstructive surgery by medical specialists.

Protection of Proprietary Information
 
We own various U.S. federal trademark registrations and applications, and unregistered trademarks, including the registered mark “IMAC Regeneration Center.” We rely on trademark laws in the United States, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary information and brand. We cannot assure you that existing trademark laws or contractual rights will be adequate for protecting our intellectual property and proprietary information. Protection of confidential information, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in the markets in which we operate and compete is highly uncertain and may involve complex legal questions. We cannot completely prevent the unauthorized use or infringement of our confidential information or intellectual property rights as such prevention is inherently difficult. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our confidential information and intellectual property protection.
 
We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights in our trademarks. We do not expect to need any additional intellectual property rights to carry out our growth and expansion strategy.
 
For years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not incur any material time or labor for the development of the technology we use in our operations.
 
Government Regulation
 
Numerous federal, state and local regulations regulate healthcare services and those who provide them. Some states into which we may expand have laws requiring facilities employing health professionals and providing health-related services to be licensed and, in some cases, to obtain a certificate of need (that is, demonstrating to a state regulatory authority the need for, and financial feasibility of, new facilities or the commencement of new healthcare services). None of the states in which we currently operate require a certificate of need for the operation of our physical therapy business functions. Our healthcare professionals and/or medical clinics, however, are required to be licensed, as determined by the state in which they provide services. Failure to obtain or maintain any required certificates, approvals or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Regulations Controlling Fraud and Abuse. Various federal and state laws regulate financial relationships involving providers of healthcare services. These laws include Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S. C. § 1320a-7b(b)) (the “Fraud and Abuse Law”), under which civil and criminal penalties can be imposed upon persons who, among other things, offer, solicit, pay or receive remuneration in return for (i) the referral of patients for the rendering of any item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a Federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid); or (ii) purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a Federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). We believe that our business procedures and business arrangements are in compliance with these provisions. However, the provisions are broadly written and the full extent of their specific application to specific facts and arrangements to which we are a party is uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, several states have enacted state laws similar to the Fraud and Abuse Law, which may be more restrictive than the federal Fraud and Abuse Law.
 
Stark Law. Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. §1395nn) (the “Stark Law”) prohibit referrals by a physician of “designated health services” which are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Unlike the Fraud and Abuse Law, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute. Proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. Physical therapy services are among the “designated health services.” Further, the Stark Law has application to our management contracts with individual physicians and physician groups, as well as, any other financial relationship between us and referring physicians, including medical advisor arrangements and any financial transaction resulting from a clinic acquisition. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. As with the Fraud and Abuse Law, we consider the Stark Law in planning our outpatient clinics, establishing contractual and other arrangements with physicians, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law or any similar state laws, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
HIPAA. In an effort to further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentially, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of health fraud against all public and private payers. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information in an effort to ensure the privacy and electronic security of patient information and standards relating to the privacy of health information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February of 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) was signed into law. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), provided for substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (“EHRs”) and grants for the development of health information exchange (“HIE”). Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, a number of states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA.

We believe that our operations comply with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business.
 
Cybersecurity. We are a medical provider and comply with HIPAA and data sensitivity requirements as regulated by local and federal authorities. Our patient data is hosted, managed and secured with an approved Electronic Medical Record vendor. Cybersecurity is of paramount importance and our executive officers have implemented routine cyber breach insurance policies to protect our company from potential predatory initiatives to access patient and company data. See “Risk Factors – Our reputation and relationships with patients would be harmed if our patients’ data, particularly personally identifying data, were to be subject to a cyber-attack or otherwise by unauthorized persons.”
 
FDA Drug Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. As a result of these regulations, pharmaceutical product development and approval are very expensive and time consuming.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 

13

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. For dermatology products, Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
After completion of the required activities, including clinical testing, a NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States.
 
The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with the FDA’s good clinical practice requirements. Additionally, the FDA typically inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and may inspect the sponsor company and investigator sites that participated in the clinical trials. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the stated indication.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction following FDA review of a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA filed under section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act. An alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA (“505(b)(2) NDA”), which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 
505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.

Biologics
 
Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), via a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs and BLA supplements, including review timelines, are very similar to those for NDAs and NDA supplements, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as other drugs.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once a NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety reports is required following FDA approval of a NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity, patent or non-patent, for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of our programs.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies (RMAT) Designation
 
The FDA has established a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence (such as electronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
 
Other Regulatory Factors. Political, economic and regulatory influences are fundamentally changing the healthcare industry in the United States. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. Potential alternative approaches could include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, and price controls. Legislative debate is expected to continue in the future and market forces are expected to demand only modest increases or reduced costs. For instance, managed care entities are demanding lower reimbursement rates from healthcare providers and, in some cases, are requiring or encouraging providers to accept capitated payments that may not allow providers to cover their full costs or realize traditional levels of profitability. We cannot reasonably predict what impact the adoption of federal or state healthcare reform measures or future private sector reform may have on our business.

In recent years, federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering behavior that violates the federal civil and criminal laws regarding false claims and fraudulent billing and coding practices. Such laws require providers to adhere to complex reimbursement requirements regarding proper billing and coding in order to be compensated for their services by government payers. Our compliance program requires adherence to applicable law and promotes reimbursement education and training; however, a determination that our clinics’ billing and coding practices are false or fraudulent could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
As a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Managed care payers may also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in refunding amounts we have been paid; fines penalties and/or revocation of billing privileges for the affected clinics; exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payer network; or damage to our reputation.
 
We and our outpatient medical clinics are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting entities and individuals from knowingly and willfully making claims to Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs and third-party payers that contain false or fraudulent information. The federal False Claims Act encourages private individuals to file suits on behalf of the government against healthcare providers such as us. As such suits are generally filed under seal with a court to allow the government adequate time to investigate and determine whether it will intervene in the action, the implicated healthcare providers often are unaware of the suit until the government has made its determination and the seal is lifted. Violations or alleged violations of such laws, and any related lawsuits, could result in (i) exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, or (ii) significant financial or criminal sanctions, resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing errors that are replicated in a large number of claims, as each individual claim could be deemed a separate violation. In addition, many states also have enacted similar statutes, which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines, and treble damages.
 
Employees and Human Capital Management
 
As of March 28, 2023, we employed 85 individuals, of which 85 were full-time employees. As of that date, none of our employees were governed by collective bargaining agreements or were members of a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Integrating new staff into our culture is important for developing a positive work environment and maintaining future job satisfaction. Since December 2017, we have issued a semi-annual employee satisfaction survey to identify opportunities to enhance our corporate culture. We strive for greater diversity and inclusion through our employment and management practices. Today, our full-time employees range in age from 21-70 years, 25% of our executive team is female, 33% of our medical doctors represent a racial minority, and 74% of our full-time staff is female. We remain further committed to increasing the diversity of our employee base.

In the states in which our current outpatient clinics are located, persons performing designated medical or physical therapy services are required to be licensed by the state. Based on standard employee screening systems in place, all persons currently employed by us who are required to be licensed are licensed. We are not aware of any federal licensing requirements applicable to our employees.
 
Medical Advisory Board
 
We have a Medical Advisory Board comprised of all IMAC medical physicians. The Advisory Board meets annually to discuss matters relating to our therapies, range of medical treatments and strategic direction, and periodically presents its suggestions to our Board and to executive management. Members of the Advisory Board are reimbursed by us for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in serving on the Advisory Board.
