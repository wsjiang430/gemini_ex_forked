 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory, or immuno-inflammatory, disorders with high unmet medical need. Our strategy is focused on advancing the clinical development of our product candidates, including potentially pursuing additional indications and acquiring new product candidates and platforms to expand our pipeline. We intend to commercialize our product candidates either independently or through partnerships or otherwise monetize our pipeline through strategic transactions.

Our current clinical-stage product candidates consist of EQ101, EQ102 and itolizumab (EQ001). EQ101 and EQ102 are synthetic peptides engineered to specifically inhibit key disease-driving, clinically validated cytokine targets aimed at addressing unmet needs across a range of immuno-inflammatory indications. EQ101 is a first-in-class, selective, tri-specific inhibitor of IL-2, IL-9 and IL-15, and EQ102 is a first-in-class, selective, bi-specific inhibitor of IL-15 and IL-21. Itolizumab (EQ001) is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the immune checkpoint receptor CD6, which plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cell, or Teff cell, activity and trafficking that drives a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases across multiple therapeutic areas. Our novel and differentiated pipeline of first-in-class immunology assets has the potential to address unmet medical needs in numerous areas, including dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, hematology, transplant science, oncology and pulmonology.
 


We are focused on developing EQ101, EQ102 and itolizumab (EQ001) as potential best-in-class, disease modifying treatments for multiple severe immuno-inflammatory disorders and currently have active clinical development programs with all three assets. The following chart summarizes the status of our current clinical development programs. Details for each program are outlined in ‘Our Initial Clinical Indications’ section below.



Strategy

Our goal is to become a leading, fully-integrated biotechnology company focused on therapies for severe immuno-inflammatory disorders. To achieve our goal, we intend to:
 •Develop EQ101 for the treatment of Alopecia Areata. We are conducting a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study in subjects with alopecia areata, or AA. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EQ101 administered intravenously, or IV, with secondary objectives including the evaluation of drug efficacy, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, or PK/PD, properties, and changes in patient biomarkers. In addition, we are developing a subcutaneous, or SC, formulation of EQ101 expected to be ready for subsequent clinical studies.
 •Develop EQ102 for the treatment of Celiac Disease. We are conducting a Phase 1 first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of EQ102 administered SC as single or multiple doses in up to 64 healthy volunteers. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of EQ102, with secondary objectives including the assessment of PK/PD changes. Following the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, part of this study, we are planning an additional part which will evaluate the biological activity of EQ102 in subjects with celiac disease.
 •Develop itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of GVHD. We are conducting EQUATOR, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of itolizumab (EQ001) in acute graft-versus-host disease, or aGVHD. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the efficacy and safety of itolizumab (EQ001) versus placebo as a first-line therapy for aGVHD in combination with corticosteroids. 
 •Develop itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of lupus and lupus nephritis. We are conducting the Type B portion of EQUALISE, a Phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical study of itolizumab (EQ001) in patients with lupus nephritis, or LN. We completed the Type A portion, which was a MAD study involving 35 systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, patients to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD and clinical activity of itolizumab (EQ001) dosed SC every two weeks, or Q2W. 
 •Opportunistically expand our pipeline. We will continue to conduct preclinical and translational studies and assimilate learnings from clinical studies to help inform the selection of additional indications for future development of our product candidates. We will also leverage the collective talent within our organization to opportunistically discover, acquire or in-license other high-value therapeutic programs that may complement our core strategy or have the potential for synergistic therapeutic benefit in combination with EQ101, EQ102 or itolizumab (EQ001).
 •Build a commercial infrastructure. If any of our product candidates are approved, we may commercialize them ourselves in indications that can be effectively targeted using a specialty sales force. For other indications that require a larger sales force, we may commercialize approved products through collaborations with other parties. 
Acquisition
 We acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to EQ101 and EQ102 through the acquisition of Bioniz Therapeutics, Inc., or Bioniz, in February 2022. Through the acquisition, we expanded our immunology pipeline with first-in-class immuno-inflammatory product candidates across a range of development stages and obtained a proprietary platform for discovering additional, novel multi-cytokine targeting product candidates. See Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details of this acquisition.
Partnerships

Option Agreement with Ono
 
On December 5, 2022, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Ono, pursuant to which we granted Ono the exclusive right, but not the obligation, to acquire our rights to itolizumab (EQ001), or the Option. These rights include all therapeutic indications and the rights to commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In exchange for the Option, Ono paid us a one-time, upfront payment of an amount equal to JPY 3.5 billion, or $26.4 million.

If Ono exercises the Option, Ono will pay us a one-time, payment of an amount equal to JPY 5.0 billion, or approximately $37.2 million based on the currency exchange rate quoted by MUFG Bank, Ltd. on March 16, 2023. We are also eligible to receive up to $101.4 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones.

We are responsible for conducting all research and development of itolizumab (EQ001), which will be funded by Ono on a quarterly basis from July 1, 2022 through the option period. Unless terminated early, the option period will expire three months following the delivery of topline data from the EQUALISE clinical study in LN and interim data from the EQUATOR Phase 3 clinical study in aGVHD.

The Asset Purchase Agreement can be terminated at any time by Ono upon written notice, provided that in limited circumstances Ono will be obligated to continue to reimburse us for research and development costs and expenses of itolizumab (EQ001) for a certain period of time following such termination. If Ono does not timely exercise its Option, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Option will automatically terminate. The Asset Purchase Agreement also contains customary termination rights for both parties for material breach and an outside date (subject to limited adjustments) that permits either party to terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement if the closing has not occurred by December 31, 2025.

The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties with respect to both Equillium and Ono. Additionally, we are subject to customary obligations and covenants, including affirmative and negative operating covenants with respect to our business as it applies to the development and exploitation of itolizumab (EQ001), exclusivity obligations that prohibit us, except in limited circumstances, including in connection with the sale of our company, from pursuing a direct or indirect sale, license or other disposition of all or any portion of our itolizumab (EQ001) program or any of the assets to be purchased pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, and indemnification obligations, which, except in limited circumstances, are subject to customary caps and deductibles. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

Collaboration and License Agreement with Biocon

We acquired the rights to itolizumab (EQ001) in May 2017, pursuant to a collaboration and license agreement with Biocon SA (subsequently assigned to Biocon Limited, or together, Biocon). Pursuant to that agreement and subsequent amendments, or Biocon License, Biocon granted us an exclusive license to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit itolizumab (EQ001) and any pharmaceutical composition or preparation containing or comprising itolizumab (EQ001) that uses Biocon technology or Biocon know-how, or collectively, a Biocon Product, in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, or the Equillium Territory. Our collaboration with Biocon includes an exclusive supply agreement for clinical and commercial drug product of itolizumab (EQ001), or the Clinical Supply Agreement. Biocon currently manufactures itolizumab (EQ001) at commercial scale in a facility in India regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In addition, we have agreed to co-fund an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of itolizumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis being conducted by Biocon in India.
 
In consideration for the rights granted to us by Biocon, we issued to Biocon 2,316,134 shares of common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Biocon up to an aggregate of $30 million in regulatory milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and up to an aggregate of $565 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of first commercial sale of product and specified levels of product sales. We are also required to pay royalties on tiers of aggregate annual net sales of Biocon Products by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees in the United States and Canada at percentages from the mid-single digits to sub-teen double digits and on tiers of aggregate annual net sales of Biocon Products by us and our affiliates (but not our sublicensees) in Australia and New Zealand, in each case, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. Biocon is also required to pay us royalties at comparable percentages for sales of itolizumab outside of the Equillium Territory if the approvals in such geographies included or referenced our data, including data from certain of our clinical studies, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. Should Ono exercise its Option to acquire our rights to

itolizumab (EQ001), the aforementioned milestone payments and royalties potentially owed to Biocon would become Ono’s responsibility, and the potential royalties on sales of itolizumab (EQ001) outside of the Equillium Territory would become Ono’s right. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of the Biocon License and Clinical Supply Agreement.
 
Understanding the Basis of Our Approach: Multi-Cytokine Inhibition
 
Targeted Inhibition of Disease-Associated γC Cytokines with Novel Compounds Generated from a Proprietary Discovery Platform

Our proprietary multi-cytokine platform generates rationally designed composite peptides that selectively block key cytokines at the shared receptor level targeting pathogenic cytokine redundancies and synergies while preserving non-pathogenic signaling.
 
This approach provides multi-cytokine inhibition at the receptor level and is expected to avoid the broad immuno-suppression and off-target safety liabilities of Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitors. Many immune-mediated diseases are driven by the same combination of dysregulated cytokines, and we believe identifying the key cytokines for these diseases will allow us to target and develop customized treatment strategies for multiple autoimmune diseases.
 
Many monoclonal antibody, or mAb, therapies are targeted to a single cytokine or cytokine receptor and may not completely address the disease pathology if more than one cytokine is implicated in the disease process. Another therapeutic approach, inhibition of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, or JAK/STAT, signaling pathway, lacks specificity as it inhibits a signaling pathway that is utilized by many cytokines regardless of their involvement in the disease. As a result, this class of compounds is often associated with serious side effects. Our proprietary peptides selectively block multiple disease driving cytokines while maintaining the healthy immune balance through the normal function of other family members. See Figure 1.
 

Figure 1: Rationally-designed, selective inhibition of multiple cytokines is believed to represent an optimized therapeutic modality compared to mAb and JAK inhibitors.

Equillium’s Multi-Cytokine Inhibitors Selectively Block Activity of Certain Cytokines by Binding Pockets in the gC Common Receptor
 
EQ101 is a first-in-class, tri-specific inhibitor of IL-2, IL-9 and IL-15, three inflammatory cytokines implicated in multiple diseases. It selectively blocks those three key pathogenic cytokines while preserving non-pathogenic signaling related to the other gC cytokine family members, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-21 (Figure 2). EQ101 has demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept as a novel tri-specific cytokine inhibitor through a completed Phase 1/2 clinical study in cutaneous T cell lymphoma, or CTCL, a

dermato-oncology indication. The study achieved its primary objective of safety and tolerability and showed clinically meaningful improvements in the modified severity-weighted assessment tool, or SWAT, scores. In that study, the compound was shown to be well tolerated with a favorable safety profile with no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, no dose-limiting toxicities, and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.
 

Figure 2: EQ101 inhibits IL-2, IL-9 and IL-15, but not IL-4-, IL-7 and IL-21
 
EQ102 is a first-in-class, selective inhibitor of IL-15 and IL-21 (Figure 3). It has undergone substantial translational work supporting its potential use as a treatment for various gastrointestinal diseases including celiac disease, an immune disorder related to gluten exposure. The high degree of selectivity for IL-15 and IL-21 inhibition aligns well with the demonstrated key involvement of these two cytokines that work synergistically in driving the pathology in celiac disease and other inflammatory gut and hepatic disorders.

EQ101 & EQ102 Product Development

EQ101
 
EQ101 is a synthetic peptide covalently conjugated to a polyethylene glycol, or PEG, molecule in a site-specific manner. The drug substance is currently manufactured under good manufacturing practices, or GMP, by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, located in the United States. EQ101 drug product is currently formulated as a lyophilized powder for IV injection following reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, or SWFI. EQ101 SC formulation development is ongoing and expected to be ready for subsequent clinical studies.
 
Preclinical proof-of-concept studies of EQ101 have been conducted utilizing an animal model of immune-mediated hair loss. Non-Obese-Diabetic, or NOD, severe immune-deficient, or SCID, γc (CD132)-/- (NSG) mice are deficient in lymphoid cells and were used for generating a humanized mouse model of immune-mediated hair loss, which has been used by other labs (Sonntag 2015). Humanized mice that are transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells manifest symptoms including severe systemic hair loss or alopecia. Following the development of significant alopecia, approximately 4−5 weeks post-transplant, the animals initiated study treatment. Response to treatment was evaluated using survival, body weight, serum cytokine levels (i.e., IL-2, IL-6, IL-15, TNFa, IFNγ), and hair regrowth.

The efficacy results from the intervention studies found that EQ101 blockade of IL-2, IL-9 and IL-15 signaling resulted in significant regrowth of hair in this immune-mediated hair loss mouse model of AA. In addition, EQ101 also reduced circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and interferon gamma, or IFNγ, which are part of the immuno-inflammatory process observed in patients with AA. In this mouse model, EQ101 appeared to be more efficacious than an anti-IL-2 mAb, an anti-IL-15 mAb, and the JAK 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. These results suggest that EQ101 has promise as a novel potential treatment for patients with AA.
 
EQ101 has been evaluated by Bioniz in three completed human clinical studies. One was a single ascending dose, or SAD, clinical study in healthy volunteers and another was a MAD clinical study in healthy volunteers. In the SAD study, subjects received EQ101 administered IV, at a single dose of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, or 6.4 mg/kg. In the MAD study, subjects received four weekly IV doses of EQ101 at 0.5, 1, or 1.5 mg/kg or three doses every other week at 2 or 3 mg/kg. A total of 43 healthy

subjects received at least 1 dose of EQ101 in each of the two studies. EQ101 was considered well-tolerated with no deaths, serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events, infusion reactions or dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs.
 
Bioniz also evaluated EQ101 in an open-label Phase 1/2 dose-ranging clinical study of patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia, or LGLL, or refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma, or rCTCL, to characterize the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, and PK/PD of EQ101. The study enrolled 50 subjects, 30 with refractory CTCL and 20 with LGLL. Four escalating dose levels of 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg were administered weekly by IV infusion for up to 74 weeks. The study found that EQ101 was well-tolerated, with no DLTs, no infusion reactions, and no deaths, and only one subject discontinued participation due to an adverse event. Subjects treated with EQ101 exhibited a reduction in IL-2 and IL-15 dependent cells and inflammation, with improvements in skin lesions and a favorable overall response rate observed. Both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted EQ101 Orphan Drug designations for the treatment of CTCL in July 2019 and April 2021, respectively.
 
EQ102
 
EQ102 is also a synthetic peptide that is conjugated to a PEG molecule in a site-specific manner. The drug substance is currently manufactured under GMP by a CMO located in China. EQ102 drug product is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution using SWFI prior to SC administration.
 
Our Phase 1 clinical study is the first human clinical study of EQ102. Safety, toxicity, and PK/PD of EQ102 have been previously evaluated during the nonclinical development program that included 4-week toxicology studies in both rodents and Cynomolgus nonhuman primates, or NHP, using SC administration. In addition, an evaluation of toxicokinetic and anti-drug antibody, or ADA, potential and immunophenotype analyses were also performed in those studies. Dose-ranging studies were conducted in both mice and NHP to characterize the maximum tolerated doses and to inform dose selection for clinical development.
 
Understanding the Basis of Our Approach: CD6-ALCAM Pathway Inhibition
 
The Role of CD6 in Autoimmunity
 
The role of the immune system is to defend the body against foreign organisms and cells, including cancerous cells, and in doing so must distinguish accurately between self- and non-self entities, a process called tolerance. Autoimmunity is an immune response directed against the body’s own healthy cells and tissues, and is the underlying process in many inflammatory diseases. Autoimmunity results from a loss of tolerance caused in part by an imbalance in the relationship between T effector cells, or Teff cells, and regulatory T cells, or Treg cells. See Figure 4.

Figure 4: Autoimmunity is a balancing act. Treg cells play an important role in preventing Teff cells targeting of self-antigens that can lead to autoimmunity and tissue destruction.
Immune checkpoints are critical regulators of immune activation pathways, can be either co-stimulatory (activating) or co-inhibitory (inhibiting), and are crucial for maintaining immune balance and preventing autoimmunity. We believe co-stimulatory checkpoints are attractive drug targets for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory diseases, and more recently they have become a focus of development in immuno-inflammation. 
 

CD6 is a co-stimulatory receptor that plays an integral role in modulating T cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and trafficking. CD6 serves as a key checkpoint in regulating Teff cells that are central to autoimmune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that blockade of CD6 co-stimulation leads to selective inhibition of pathogenic Teff cell activity and trafficking, while preserving the important regulatory function of Treg cells. Such studies and new insights into the underlying biology highlight CD6 as a resurgent target for the treatment of multiple immuno-inflammatory diseases. 
 
Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, or ALCAM, is a ligand of CD6 that is expressed on hematopoietic tissues such as antigen-presenting cells, where it is important for immune synapse formation and optimal co-stimulation. Binding of ALCAM to domain-3 of CD6 leads to the downstream activation of several mitogen activated protein kinase pathways related to T cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and survival. See Figure 5. 
 
ALCAM is also expressed on non-hematopoietic tissues such as the vascular endothelium, blood-brain barrier, skin, lung, kidney and gut, where it selectively facilitates the trafficking of T cells expressing CD6.


Figure 5: CD6 co-stimulation drives pathogenic T cell development and activity. Co-stimulation occurs through the binding of ALCAM to domain-3 of CD6, leading to synergistic activation resulting in a five-fold increase in IL-2 receptor mediated Teff cell proliferation. Co-stimulation through CD6 promotes a pro-inflammatory response including the activation of pSTAT3 and RORγt resulting in increased expression of IL-23R and pathogenic secretion of several Teff pro-inflammatory cytokines. ALCAM expressed on tissues such as the skin, lung, gut, blood-brain-barrier and kidney, selectively facilitates the trafficking of Teff cells expressing CD6. Notably, Th17 cells (that are steroid insensitive) and associated cytokines suppress Treg cell activity leading to a high Th17:Treg ratio characteristic of chronic autoimmunity. 
 Modulation of Teff Cell Activity with Itolizumab (EQ001)
Itolizumab (EQ001) is a humanized antibody that selectively binds to human CD6 and inhibits the interaction of CD6 with its ligand ALCAM, preventing co-stimulation, and thereby reducing Teff cell activity and trafficking. Preclinical studies of itolizumab (EQ001) have shown that blockade of CD6 leads to a reduction in Teff cell proliferation and downregulation of several important pathways that contribute to Teff cell development such as Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Critically, CD6 blockade leads to the downregulation of important cellular pathways that control inflammation, including STAT3 and RORγt. The downregulation of these pathways is accompanied by decreased secretion of the pro-inflammatory Teff cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17.
 

Additionally, by inhibiting the binding of ALCAM to CD6, itolizumab modulates lymphocyte trafficking and results in reduced Teff cell infiltration into inflamed tissues. Based on its broad multi-modal mechanism, we believe itolizumab (EQ001) has the potential to treat multiple immuno-inflammatory diseases, including those that are resistant or refractory to existing therapies. See Figure 6.

Figure 6: Blockade of CD6 by itolizumab (EQ001) inhibits Teff cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and trafficking. Itolizumab (EQ001) selectively binds to domain-1 of CD6 and inhibits the interaction of ALCAM, preventing co-stimulation and thereby reducing Teff cell proliferation. Blockade of CD6 downregulates pSTAT and RORγt resulting in reduced expression of IL-23R and secretion of pro-inflammatory Teff cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17. Additionally, inhibiting the binding of ALCAM to CD6, reduces lymphocyte trafficking into inflamed tissues such as the skin, lung, gut, blood-brain-barrier and kidney. Reduction in the number and activity of Th17 cells inhibiting the Treg cells restores immune balance and promotes immune tolerance. 

Itolizumab (EQ001) Product Development

Itolizumab has shown activity in completed clinical studies conducted by Biocon in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, related to COVID-19. Itolizumab has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in India where it was originally launched by Biocon under the brand name ALZUMAb. ALZUMAb is produced in an NS0 cell line and is currently available only in an IV formulation. Itolizumab (EQ001) contains the identical monoclonal antibody sequence produced in a Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cell line and may be administered by IV or SC. CHO cell lines are the industry-standard antibody therapeutic production system. In September 2020, the Drugs Controller General of India granted approval to Biocon of itolizumab produced in a CHO cell line, marketed by Biocon in India under the brand name ALZUMAb-L, or ALZUMAb Lyophilized, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, as well as emergency use authorization of ALZUMAb-L for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Moving forward, Biocon is planning on transitioning their marketing and commercialization efforts from ALZUMAb to ALZUMAb-L. Itolizumab (EQ001) and ALZUMAb-L are different drug product names for the same formulation. 

Itolizumab (EQ001) is manufactured by Biocon at commercial scale in an FDA regulated manufacturing facility in India. Biocon has generated data demonstrating the analytical biocomparability of itolizumab (EQ001)/ALZUMAb-L and ALZUMAb using industry-standard physicochemical and biofunctional characterization methods.
 
Itolizumab (EQ001) Phase 1 Clinical Study in Healthy Subjects

Biocon conducted a Phase 1 clinical study of itolizumab (EQ001) in 37 healthy subjects that was completed in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2017. The study was conducted in two stages, with the first stage designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of ascending single doses of itolizumab (EQ001) SC, and the second stage designed to compare the PK of itolizumab (EQ001) IV to ALZUMAb and determine the absolute bioavailability of itolizumab (EQ001) SC. 

The administration of single doses of itolizumab (EQ001) SC in Stage 1 was found to be well tolerated, with a low incidence (2/24) of low titer anti-drug antibodies. There were no SAEs, DLTs, or drug discontinuations reported. No clinically meaningful changes in physical examinations or vital signs were observed, whereas transient decreases in lymphocyte counts without clinical consequences were seen in 11/24 (46%) subjects. In general, observed AEs were transient, mild to moderate

in severity, were not dose dependent, and most were consistent with those observed in prior clinical experience with ALZUMAb. 
 
In Stage 2, the infusion of single doses of both itolizumab (EQ001) IV and ALZUMAb was associated with the development of transient, reversible, grade 2 to 3 decreases in lymphocyte counts in the healthy subjects. As a result, Stage 2 of the study was terminated early following the enrollment of seven subjects, yielding limited overall safety data and insufficient PK data for evaluation. There were no SAEs reported. No other clinically meaningful abnormalities or trends were noted in clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters. Similar to Stage 1, a transient decrease in T cells expressing CD4, and to a lesser extent CD8, a two- to three-times increase in the proportion of Treg cells, and saturation of CD6 receptors were observed across itolizumab (EQ001) and ALZUMAb cohorts. 
 
While similar decreases in lymphocyte counts have not been reported with ALZUMAb previously, the timing of hematologic assessments in prior clinical studies may not have occurred at sufficiently early time-points to detect this transient response. Additionally, ALZUMAb had previously only been dosed in patients with active autoimmune disease and not healthy subjects. Importantly, the magnitude and kinetics of lymphocyte decreases were similar for itolizumab (EQ001) IV and ALZUMAb in Stage 2, while administration of itolizumab (EQ001) SC demonstrated milder decreases in lymphocyte counts, which would be expected based on the different PK properties of SC versus IV formulations. Furthermore, ALZUMAb had been well tolerated with demonstrated safety and clinical activity in three clinical studies in India in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis, with a total of 333 patients exposed to ALZUMAb to date in clinical studies at doses ranging from 0.2 mg/kg to 1.6 mg/kg over a period of four years. Therefore, we believe the transient decreases in lymphocyte counts seen in the Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects represent a PD property of both itolizumab (EQ001) and ALZUMAb that will be monitored going forward, and the results of the Phase 1 clinical study support the advancement of itolizumab (EQ001) SC and IV into further clinical development in patients with immuno-inflammatory disease. 

Our Initial Clinical Indications
 
Alopecia Areata Market Overview

AA is an inflammatory, non-scarring autoimmune-mediated condition resulting in hair loss that has limited treatment options for those with severe disease. The condition occurs when the immune system attacks hair follicles on any hair-bearing area of the body, most frequently on the head and face. The lifetime incidence of AA is estimated at about two percent globally, while the prevalence is estimated to be 0.1% to 0.2%. AA affects men and women of all racial and ethnic groups. It has a higher prevalence in children and adolescents with 40% of cases occurring prior to age 20, and 80% before age 40. The causes of AA are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle following a triggering event (e.g., stress, infection, trauma) facilitated by IFNγ, that leads to an upregulation of inflammatory cytokine signaling resulting in autoimmune-mediated hair loss. AA is associated with other immune-mediated or autoimmune disorders such as thyroiditis, vitiligo, and atopic diseases. Approximately 50% of patients have chronic relapsing, remitting disease persisting more than 12 months and approximately 10% to 35% ultimately experience complete loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or complete loss of scalp and body hair (alopecia universalis). AA has a psychosocial burden that can have a significant negative impact on health-related quality of life and has been associated with depression and anxiety.

Rationale for EQ101 for the Treatment of Alopecia Areata

IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15 have been identified as being upregulated in animal models of AA and in human biopsies of AA lesions. Studies have demonstrated cytotoxic CD8+ NKG2D+ T cells were both necessary and sufficient for the disease induction in mouse models of AA, with IL-2 increasing the number of CD8+ cells and IL-15 increasing the expression of NKG2D and the production of IFNγ by follicular epithelial cells that aberrantly transforms these T cells into cytotoxic T cells that attack the hair follicle. IL-15 released by dendritic cells and/or the follicular epithelial cells is believed to be the initiating event that promotes production of IFNγ, which leads to the initial loss of immune privilege of the hair follicle, and production of IL-2 that leads to T cell proliferation. Global transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration and upregulation of IL-2 and IL-15 that have been shown to promote the activation and survival of IFNγ-producing CD8+ NKG2D+ effector T cells. In addition, the pathologic activation by IL-9 of mast cells that produce and secrete Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13) and TGF and facilitate antigen presentation of the hair follicle to these cytotoxic T cells has been implicated in AA.

Several clinical studies have been conducted with JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AA. Initially, investigator-initiated studies using tofacitinib and ruxolitinib produced moderate response rates in small numbers of subjects that had been otherwise refractory to standard of care treatments. More recently, several industry-sponsored studies observed efficacy of

JAK inhibitors in the treatment of AA using baricitinib, ritlecitinib and deuruxolitinib. Baricitinib was granted FDA approval for the treatment of AA in June 2022.

Despite the results of those clinical studies and the approval of baricitinib, the efficacy of JAK inhibitors may be limited by their PK properties which can result in inadequate blockade of JAK signaling between doses and by the additional signaling pathways (PI3K, AKT, mTOR and MAPK/ERK) associated with the c cytokines that are not inhibited by the JAK inhibitors, which can lead to an incomplete blockade of pathologic cytokine signaling. Furthermore, safety issues have been associated with JAK inhibitors, due to their wide-ranging inhibitory effects on non-disease-related cytokine signaling, which may limit their utility and acceptance by physicians and patients. We believe EQ101 is a more selective and effective inhibitor of IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15 (i.e., disease-driving cytokines) and may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of AA.

Development Plan in Alopecia Areata

We have two open Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, for EQ101 for AA and CTCL. In November 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study (Figure 7) of EQ101 in subjects with AA in Australia. This is a multicenter, open-label, proof-of-concept clinical study in approximately 30 adult subjects between 18 and 60 years of age, with at least 35% scalp hair loss due to AA. Subjects will be dosed IV once weekly for 24 weeks with EQ101 at a dose level of 2 mg/kg, and subsequently followed for an additional four weeks. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EQ101 in subjects with moderate to severe AA over a 24-week treatment period. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate drug efficacy, PK/PD properties, and to assess changes in patient biomarkers. We expect to announce initial data from the Phase 2 clinical study of EQ101 in AA in the second half of 2023 and topline data in mid-2024. We are developing an SC formulation of EQ101 for planned use in subsequent clinical studies.

Celiac Disease Market Overview
 
Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disorder caused by inappropriate cellular and humoral immune responses to the dietary intake of gluten in the genetically susceptible individual. Celiac disease is one of the most common autoimmune disorders, with a reported prevalence of 0.5% to 1% of the global population and affecting approximately 2.3 million people in the United States. The prevalence of celiac disease has increased over the past 50 years and the rate of diagnosis has risen over the past two decades. Although celiac disease can occur at any age, onset most commonly occurs either in the first two years of life or in the second or third decades of life. Celiac disease occurs selectively in individuals expressing the gene human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. In celiac disease, a mucosal inflammatory response in the intestinal epithelia leads to villous atrophy, and crypt cell hyperplasia. The loss of mucosal integrity in celiac disease is associated with a high burden of illness resulting from a plethora of intestinal and extraintestinal disease manifestations. Currently, there are no approved products to treat celiac disease, and strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is currently the only approach for celiac disease patients to manage the disease. A full recovery is often observed in pediatric celiac disease patients, but over 40% of adult celiac disease patients maintain histological abnormalities – such as villous structural damage – following complete removal of dietary gluten. Further complicating the gluten-free treatment strategy, 5% of adult patients

can develop a refractory form of celiac disease, characterized by severe villous atrophy and the presence of abnormal intraepithelial lymphocytes, or IELs, which is considered the early stages of enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma, a potentially lethal condition not confined to intestinal epithelia.

Rationale for EQ102 for the Treatment of Celiac Disease
 
IL-15 has been identified as a key driver of celiac disease pathogenesis. IL-15 is chronically upregulated in the lamina propria and epithelium of the intestine and directly correlates with the severity of mucosal damage. This proinflammatory cytokine acts on distinct cell types resulting in malfunction of multiple immune mechanisms. Elevated IL-15 in the intestinal lamina propria has been shown to promote phenotypic changes to tolerogenic dendritic cells leading to a block in the generation of regulatory T cells, or Tregs, a lymphocyte subset critical for maintaining tolerance to self-antigens and promoting tolerance to innocuous dietary antigens. The reduction of inducible Tregs to dietary antigens elevates the potential for an intestinal inflammatory immune response to gluten intake. IL‑15 expression is also correlated with the upregulation of the activating NKG2D receptor on cytotoxic lymphocytes and its associated cytotoxic pathway, and with the complementary major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) ligands (i.e., MICA and MICB) at the epithelial cell surface that triggers their subsequent killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes.

Another γc cytokine that has been implicated in celiac disease is IL-21. IL-21 has a robust genetic association with celiac disease. IL-21 is produced by the gluten-specific CD4 T cells in celiac disease and has the capacity to promote cytolysis in intestinal intraepithelial cytotoxic T lymphocytes (IE‑CTL). IL-21 is only over-expressed in active celiac disease (patients who have gut tissue destruction) and not in potential celiac disease (those who only have antibody response and no gut tissue damage). This suggests that IL‑21 may be a co-factor along with IL-15 in causing tissue damage in active celiac disease. Furthermore, IL-21 is known to be a key cytokine in the development of B cell differentiation and plasma cell generation, and therefore antibody response. A key characteristic of celiac disease is the presence of autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 (TG2) that are produced by TG2-specific B cells. In addition to the infiltration of IE-CTLs in the lamina propria of the small bowel, there is evidence of plasmacytosis in the lamina propria which may highlight the potential pathogenic effect of autoantibody production in celiac disease. Recent studies highlighted the importance of crosstalk between CD4 T cells and B cells in activating the cytotoxic immune attack against gut tissue in celiac disease. IL‑21, as a major B-cell cytokine, may play a key role in orchestrating both antibody and cytotoxic responses in celiac disease. IL-21 inhibition may control the production of autoantibodies in these patients.
 
Further support that these two γc cytokines work in concert is bolstered by evidence that IL-15 drives IL‑21 secretion in IELs derived from patients with active celiac disease. EQ102 specifically inhibits the activity of IL-15 and IL-21, but not the remaining γc cytokines in the family (IL-2, -4, -7, or -9), thus targeting the key pathogenic cytokines in celiac disease while preserving the functional immune system through other uninterrupted γc cytokines. EQ102 has been thoroughly characterized, and we believe it is uniquely positioned to provide a specific two-pronged approach to downregulate the cytotoxic activity of IELs in celiac disease by inhibiting the synergistic effect of IL-15 and IL-21. We believe EQ102 may control the gliadin mediated inflammatory effect in celiac disease by acting on both B and T cell arms in a highly selective manner.
 
Development Plan in Celiac Disease
 
In September 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical study of EQ102 in healthy volunteers in Australia. It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of EQ102 administered SC as single or multiple doses in up to 64 healthy volunteers. In Part A, healthy volunteers will be enrolled and randomized to five cohorts (n=8 per cohort) to receive single doses of EQ102 or placebo. The starting dose in Part A will be 50 mg, with five ascending dose levels planned up to 1,000 mg. In Part B, healthy volunteers will be enrolled and randomized to three cohorts (n=8 per cohort) to receive multiple doses of EQ102 or placebo. In Part B, up to three dose levels will be evaluated, where the starting dose will be based on safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of EQ102, with secondary objectives including PK/PD changes after SAD and MAD. Following the MAD portion of this study, we plan to conduct a proof-of-concept Part C of the study, which is expected to evaluate the biological activity of EQ102 in subjects with celiac disease. See Figure 8 for an overview of the Phase 1 clinical study of EQ102. We expect to announce data from the SAD and MAD parts of the study in the second half of 2023 and celiac disease patient data in 2024.

Graft-Versus-Host Disease Market Overview

Graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD, is a multisystem disorder that is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, or allo-HSCT, caused by the transplanted immune system, more specifically Teff cells, recognizing and attacking the recipient’s body. GVHD is the leading cause of non-relapse mortality in patients receiving an allo-HSCT. The risk of GVHD limits the number and type of patients receiving allo-HSCT and we believe that a therapy that can attenuate GVHD risk could significantly expand the patient population eligible for allo-HSCT.

According to the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research and other published reports, there were approximately 10,000 allo-HSCT’s expected to have been performed in the United States in 2020 and the number of procedures has grown at an average annual growth rate of approximately 4% since 2007. Approximately 30-70% of allo-HSCT recipients develop aGVHD. Five-year survival for patients that respond to first-line treatment with corticosteroids has been reported to be as low as 53% while in steroid refractory aGVHD, the overall 5-year survival has been reported to be as low as 5%. We estimate that the incidence of aGVHD in 2020 was approximately 5,800 patients and the total prevalence of GVHD was approximately 16,000 patients. We estimate that by the year 2030, the annual incidence of aGVHD could be up to 7,000 patients and the total prevalence of GVHD could be up to 20,000 patients.

Rationale for Itolizumab (EQ001) for the Treatment of GVHD

Itolizumab (EQ001) Selectively Targets GVHD Pathogenesis

There is a high unmet medical need for a safe, effective and targeted treatment of GVHD. We believe itolizumab (EQ001) has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for aGVHD based on its ability to target the underlying biology of GVHD in a highly selective way. Further, this approach is also promising as we consider future development in the prevention of GVHD and the treatment of chronic GVHD, or cGVHD.
 
It is well established that Th17 cells, driven by pSTAT3 signaling, play a role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD, and studies have shown that pSTAT3 was significantly increased in T cells of GVHD patients. In aGVHD, additional studies have reported that Th17 cells and IL-17 serum levels were significantly elevated in patients at onset compared with HSCT patients without aGVHD. As the disease progresses, Th17 cells traffic from the peripheral blood into GVHD target tissues where they trigger damage. Furthermore, the expansion of Th17 cells in the early phase of aGVHD plays a role in the transition to cGVHD. In GVHD patients, studies have shown a high Th17:Treg ratio suggesting a loss of tolerance. Notably the increased number of circulating Th17 cells was accompanied by a decrease in Treg cells, suggesting a loss of Teff cell regulation. Such regulatory mechanisms are crucial for eliminating alloreactive T cell activity, thus preventing sustained autoimmune responses and tissue destruction in GVHD.

We believe itolizumab (EQ001) can selectively target elements of the underlying pathogenesis of aGVHD by: a) inhibiting Teff cells proliferation; b) downregulating the STAT3 pathway associated with development of pathogenic Th17 cells driving GVHD pathogenesis; c) inhibiting trafficking of Teff cells into GVHD target tissues preventing further inflammation and organ damage; and d) reducing the Th17:Treg ratio associated with the development of GVHD and thereby promoting tolerance.


Third-party Clinical Experience with Targeting CD6 in GVHD

Clinical evidence to support the rationale of treating GVHD with itolizumab (EQ001) comes from previously-reported third-party clinical experience with CD6-expressing T cell depletion in patients receiving bone marrow transplants for hematologic malignancies where it has been demonstrated that using an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody to deplete T cells from donor bone marrow or lymphocyte infusions has the potential to prevent aGVHD. In a study evaluating the clinical effects of selective in vitro CD6 expressing T cell depletion of donor allogeneic bone marrow using a monoclonal antibody to CD6 and rabbit complement, Soiffer et al. reported that in vitro T cell depletion with an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody effectively reduced the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplant without compromising engraftment.

Subsequent studies further confirmed the feasibility of CD6-expressing T cell depletion in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from human leukocyte antigen identical related and unrelated donors. In these studies, CD6 expressing depletion of the donor stem cell product was the sole method for GVHD prophylaxis. The low incidence of aGVHD reported in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow treated with anti-CD6 monoclonal antibodies was attributed to the early appearance of a population of peripheral CD3 expressing T lymphocytes with a CD6-negative phenotype, which showed diminished reactivity to allogeneic stimulation in mixed lymphocyte reaction assays. Although the above described approach is one of ex vivo CD6-expressing T cell depletion, we believe that it further supports the role of CD6-expressing T cells in aGVHD pathogenesis and validates CD6 as a potentially important target for modulation for the treatment of GVHD.
 Development Plan in GVHD

Our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the FDA for aGVHD was accepted in July 2018. The FDA granted itolizumab (EQ001) Fast Track designation for the treatment of aGVHD in December 2018 and Orphan Drug designations for both the prevention and treatment of aGVHD in February 2019.
 
In March 2019, we initiated EQUATE, an open-label Phase 1b clinical study of itolizumab (EQ001) as a first-line therapy concomitant with steroids for the treatment of aGVHD. In the EQUATE clinical study, we are assessing safety, PK, PD, and a number of clinical outcomes including complete response, or CR, rate, overall response rate, or ORR, survival and steroid taper. An overview of the design of the EQUATE study is depicted in Figure 9.
 

Figure 9: Overview of the EQUATE clinical study design
 
In February 2023, we presented final safety and efficacy results from the EQUATE clinical study at the Tandem Meetings of the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research. Data was presented from a total of 30 subjects treated with itolizumab (EQ001) at doses of 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 mg/kg. Itolizumab (EQ001) treatment in combination with systemic corticosteroids was associated with rapid and durable high rates of overall clinical response, where response at Day 29 was associated with improved progression-free survival through 1 year. Further, responders were able to taper steroids by 70% at Day 29 and 99% at Day 169. Itolizumab (EQ001) was well-tolerated in severe aGVHD patients. Based on these findings and feedback from both the FDA and leading physicians in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in March 2022 we initiated EQUATOR, a Phase 3 pivotal clinical study in first-line aGVHD.

EQUATOR is a randomized, double-blind clinical study that will assess the efficacy and safety of itolizumab (EQ001) versus placebo as a first-line therapy for aGVHD in combination with corticosteroids. The primary objective of the study is to achieve early disease response, with key secondary objectives to evaluate durability of response, corticosteroid use, survival

outcomes, and cGVHD incidence. The primary endpoint assessment is CR rate at Day 29, with key secondary endpoints of overall response rate, or ORR, at Day 29 and durability of CR rate from Day 29 through Day 99.
 
The EQUATOR study will compare the efficacy and safety of IV administered itolizumab (EQ001) versus placebo (randomized 1:1) as a first-line therapy in up to 200 adult and adolescent patients with Grade III-IV aGVHD or Grade II aGVHD with lower GI involvement, in combination with high doses of corticosteroids, the current standard of care. Per the study protocol, patients must receive itolizumab (EQ001) within 3 days of the first administration of high-dose corticosteroids with a treatment period from Days 1-99 and a follow-up period from Days 100-365. Eligible subjects who receive 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent on Day 1 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following two treatment groups: Group A: itolizumab (EQ001), 1.6 mg/kg initial dose followed by 6 doses of 0.8 mg/kg once every two weeks (Q2W), plus systemic corticosteroids (100 subjects), or Group B: placebo, 7 doses Q2W, plus systemic corticosteroids (100 subjects). An independent data monitoring committee will regularly review safety data, and an interim analysis is planned after approximately 100 subjects have completed Day 29 assessments to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment. We anticipate that interim review occurring in 2024. An overview of the design of the EQUATOR study is depicted in Figure 10.
 
Figure 10: Overview of the EQUATOR clinical study design
Lupus Market Overview
SLE is a heterogeneous, multisystem, autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of multiple autoantibodies and deposition of immune complexes in various tissues. Based on publicly available sources, we estimate that SLE impacts between 250,000 and 322,000 people in the United States.

LN is the most frequent, serious manifestation of SLE occurring in up to 30-60% of SLE patients. It is estimated there are over 100,000 patients living with LN in the United States; despite the significant number of people affected, there are currently only two FDA-approved drugs for this condition.

Current Therapies for Lupus Nephritis and their Limitations

Current standard-of-care therapy for the most aggressive type of LN, called proliferative LN or Class III or IV LN, consists of broad-based immunosuppressive drugs, such as prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, or MMF, and cyclophosphamide, which come with significant toxicities. LN is predominantly a disease of young women, and these drugs carry with them a number of toxicities that are particularly problematic for this population including weight gain, edema, moon face, infection risk, diabetes, and infertility.

While these therapies have improved 5-year survival for LN patients, as many as 50-75% of patients are refractory to treatment and those that respond will likely relapse within five years. In those patients who are refractory or relapse after initial treatment with induction therapy, there is no consensus or strong evidence to support what treatments may be effective. The prognosis for patients with proliferative LN remains poor and up to 40% of patients will progress to end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. Overall, the available options are quite limited for LN patients, particularly those that are refractory to, or relapse from standard induction therapy. Recently, two new therapies have been

approved for LN. GlaxoSmithKline’s Benlysta, which was approved for LN in December 2020, targets BLyS and inhibits the stimulation of autoreactive B-cells. Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Lupkynis, which was approved in January 2021, is a calcineurin inhibitor that blocks IL-2 expression and inhibits autoreactive T cells. Despite those recent approvals, there remains a significant need for new therapies that are more effective, can maintain a durable response, and carry a better safety profile.
 
Rationale for Itolizumab (EQ001) for the Treatment of LN

Itolizumab (EQ001) Selectively Targets Teff Cells that Play a Central Role in the Pathogenesis of LN
 
Despite the presence of autoantibody formation and inflammatory cytokines in SLE and LN, B cell-directed and single-cytokine targeted therapies have largely failed in clinical development. More recent evidence has demonstrated that Teff cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of both SLE and LN in that they mediate tissue damage and also enhance the production of autoantibodies by promoting B cell differentiation, proliferation and maturation. Multiple Teff cells/cytokines, such Th1/IFN-γ, Th2/IL-4 and Th17/IL-17, have all been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of both SLE and LN, highlighting the complex nature of the disease. However, Th17 cells are emerging as key targets as it has been demonstrated that high levels of IL-17 predict poor histopathological outcome after immunosuppressive therapy in patients with LN. Elevated levels of Th17 cells are accompanied by a decrease of Treg cells, suggesting that loss of this functional immune balance may be involved in the pathogenesis of renal damage in SLE patients. Therefore, targeting Teff cells, or molecules that modulate Teff cell activity, while preserving Treg activity could prove to be a successful therapeutic strategy for patients with SLE and LN.

We believe the unique mechanism of action of itolizumab (EQ001) can selectively target elements of the underlying pathogenesis of LN by: a) inhibiting multiple pathogenic Teff cells and cytokine secretion; b) inhibiting trafficking of Teff cells into kidney tissues; and c) reducing the Th17:Treg ratio associated with LN.
 
Translational Research Supporting Itolizumab (EQ001) in LN

Given the central role that Teff cells play in the immunopathogenesis of SLE and LN, we believe itolizumab (EQ001), which has been shown to block the CD6-ALCAM pathway and inhibit both the activity as well as trafficking of Teff cells into tissues, represents a promising therapeutic approach in this disease. To support this hypothesis, data from preclinical experiments in animal models of SLE and glomerulonephritis demonstrated that treatment with an anti-CD6 mAb lowers pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves disease activity, proteinuria, and renal function. In addition, validation for targeting the CD6-ALCAM pathway with itolizumab (EQ001) in LN is bolstered by translational research findings in human tissue and was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in January 2022. The manuscript highlights data confirming the role of T cells activated by the CD6-ALCAM pathway in the development of LN and supports our research of itolizumab (EQ001) as a potentially novel therapeutic for treating LN.
 
Research conducted at the University of Houston, supported by a Target Identification in Lupus Grant from the Lupus Research Alliance, has shown that patients with active LN have substantial elevations in urinary ALCAM and that ALCAM levels in the urine track with disease activity. See Figure 11. These data further highlight the potentially important pathogenic role of the CD6-ALCAM pathway in patients with LN.





Figure 11: ALCAM is a predictive biomarker in patients with active LN. The graph depicts levels of ALCAM in the urine of active LN, active (non-renal) SLE, inactive SLE and healthy controls by ELISA. ALCAM was highest in active LN patients while SLE patients were higher than healthy controls. The table compares the performance of urinary protein markers in differentiating active LN (N=89) from inactive LN (N=60) in African-American and Hispanic systemic lupus erythematosus patients.

 
In addition to target validation, this research on urinary biomarkers may also have important implications in how we develop itolizumab (EQ001) in LN. The ease and scalability of using urine as a non-invasive liquid biopsy of the kidney provides us an opportunity to potentially change the way we identify and treat patients with LN. A biomarker-guided treatment approach using real-time urinary testing of the CD6-ALCAM pathway to determine the right patients for therapy, guide treatment, and monitor the disease has the potential to increase the chance of advancing a targeted therapeutic to drug approval and significantly improve patient care. Specifically, elevations in urinary biomarkers, such as soluble ALCAM or CD6, could be used to identify patients most likely to respond to itolizumab (EQ001). An evaluation of these biomarkers will be an important part of the development program and forms the initial basis for exploring a personalized medicine biomarker strategy with itolizumab (EQ001).

Development Plan in LN

In July 2019, our IND for lupus/LN was accepted by the FDA, and in December 2019 the FDA granted itolizumab (EQ001) Fast Track designation for the treatment of LN. In September 2019, we initiated EQUALISE, a Phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical study of itolizumab (EQ001) in patients with SLE and in patients with LN. The completed Type A portion was a MAD study involving 35 SLE patients to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity of SC doses of itolizumab (EQ001) ranging from 0.4 mg/kg to 3.2 mg/kg Q2W. The ongoing Type B portion of the study is open label and

is evaluating up to 20 newly diagnosed or refractory LN patients who will be treated with itolizumab (EQ001) dosed at 1.6 mg/kg SC Q2W for up to 24 weeks. The selection of the 1.6 mg/kg dose was based on the totality of the safety, tolerability, and PK/PD data in the Type A part of the study that demonstrated a plateau in the reduction of CD6 cell surface expression above the 1.6 mg/kg dose. In addition to the same objectives as were in the Type A portion of the study, the Type B portion will also assess potential clinical activity of itolizumab (EQ001) in LN patients based on proteinuria levels and SLEDAI-2K scores. An overview of the design of the EQUALISE study is depicted in Figure 12.
 

Figure 12: Overview of the EQUALISE clinical study design
 
In March 2021, we reported favorable topline data from the Type A group of the EQUALISE study in patients with SLE where the data showed itolizumab (EQ001) was well tolerated. In addition, itolizumab (EQ001) demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction of cell surface CD6 expression on effector T cells, an indicator of drug activity, consistent with its mechanism of action.
 
In September 2022, we announced interim results from the Type B LN portion of the study where itolizumab (EQ001) demonstrated clinically meaningful responses in highly proteinuric subjects. The interim data reported on 13 patients, with 11 patients reaching at least 12 weeks of treatment and 6 patients reaching 28 weeks or the end of study, or EOS. Based on published guidelines for the management of LN from the European League Against Rheumatism, or EULAR, and European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, or ERA-EDTA, clinical activity assessments in this study are focused on the change in UPCR from baseline; proportion of patients with a CR, defined as 50% or greater reduction in UPCR and less than 0.5-0.7 g/g; and proportion of patients achieving a partial response, or PR, defined as 50% or greater reduction in UPCR. Subjects in the interim analysis were highly proteinuric with a baseline mean UPCR of 5.8 g/g. Clinically meaningful responses were observed by week 28 (EOS) including 3 of 6 (50%) subjects achieving a CR (UPCR < 0.7 g/g), 2 of 6 (33%) subjects achieving a PR (UPCR > 50% reduction) and 4 of 6 (67%) subjects achieving greater than 80% reduction in UPCR. In all subjects receiving more than one dose, 8 of 12 (67%) subjects achieved greater than 50% reduction in UPCR, we observed an average reduction of 60% in UPCR (over 3g of proteinuria) and subjects titrated steroid dose to < 7.5 mg/day consistent with EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations. Itolizumab (EQ001) treatment was generally well tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations. We expect to announce topline data from the Type B portion of the EQUALISE study of patients with active proliferative LN in the first half of 2024.

 We file U.S. provisional patent applications as well as U.S. non-provisional applications and PCT applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the 153 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. At the end of the period of 2 1/2 years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first 2 1/2 years of filing.
 We intend to prosecute the pending applications that we own and in-license and to pursue patent issuance and protection in key commercial markets where we expect significant product sales may occur.
With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a Biologics License Application, or BLA.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our products and services. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the patent. A U.S. patent also may be afforded a patent term adjustment, or PTA, under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in obtaining the patent from the USPTO. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent

term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. In addition, in the United States, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on trade secrets relating to product candidates and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, including through breaches of such agreements with our employees and consultants. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific partners, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Moreover, there are several companies marketing or developing treatments that may be approved for the same indications and/or diseases as our product candidates.
Alopecia Areata
 The management of AA currently involves the use of a variety of topical, intralesional, and systemic agents, as well as devices, but the response to treatment varies widely. First-line therapies typically rely on topical or intralesional corticosteroids and in more severe patients, systemic corticosteroids. For refractory disease, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine and cyclosporine may be used. There is currently only one product, baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor with a brand name of Olumiant, approved by the FDA for the treatment of AA. Clinical studies have studied JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators, among others. Companies involved in alopecia areata drug development include Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc., ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Limited, Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (acquired by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.), Forte Biosciences, Inc., Horizon Therapeutics plc, Legacy Healthcare, Pfizer Inc., Reistone Biopharma, Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., and Zura Bio Limited.
Celiac Disease
 The only available treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. Most patients have difficulty maintaining such a diet and many patients do not fully respond, with symptoms persisting despite avoidance of gluten. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for treatment of celiac disease. We are aware of a number of companies with development programs targeting the condition including Anokion SA, Calypso Biotech BV, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., IGY Immune Technologies & Life Sciences Inc., Immunic, Inc., ImmunogenX, Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., Provention Bio, Selecta Biosciences, Theriva Biologics, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and Zedira GmbH.
 aGVHD
Corticosteroids, or steroids, remain the standard of care for the first-line treatment of aGVHD. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies indicated as a first-line treatment of aGVHD. Second-line therapy consists of off-label immunosuppressives for which the therapeutic benefit has not been established, and Incyte Corporation’s ruxolitinib which was approved for the treatment of steroid refractory aGVHD in 2019.
In addition, we are aware of a number of companies with development programs in first-line and steroid refractory aGVHD, including AltruBio, Inc., ASC Therapeutics, CSL Behring LLC, Cynata Therapeutics Limited, ElsaLys Biotech, Humanigen, Inc., Maat Pharma SA, Medac GmbH, Mesoblast Limited, Shenzhen Xbiome Biotech, Co., Ltd., VectivBio Holding AG, and Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.
 Lupus Nephritis
 Standard of care induction treatment in patients with the most severe forms of LN, called proliferative LN or Class III or IV LN, is typically IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone with the addition of MMF or cyclophosphamide. Standard of care for maintenance therapy is typically a combination of corticosteroids and MMF or calcineurin inhibitors. There are currently two approved therapies for the treatment of LN. One is GlaxoSmithKline’s Benlysta, approved in 2020, and the other is Lupkynis (voclosporin), which was approved in January 2021 and is marketed by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.
 We are aware of a number of companies with development programs targeting LN including Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Corestem Co., Ltd., CSL Behring LLC, Genentech Inc., Jansen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Kezar Life Sciences, Inc., Novartis AG, Omeros Corporation and Vera Therapeutics, Inc.
 Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We expect to manage sales, marketing, patient access and distribution either through internal resources or through third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Should Ono exercise its option to acquire our rights to itolizumab (EQ001), the commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001) would be Ono’s responsibility.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on CMOs to manufacture EQ101 and EQ102. We rely on Biocon, our contract manufacturer, pursuant to the Biocon License and Biocon Supply Agreement, for all our required raw materials, drug substance and drug product needs for preclinical research, clinical studies and commercial supply of itolizumab (EQ001). Biocon manufactures itolizumab (EQ001) at commercial scale at its FDA-regulated facility in Bangalore, India.
With respect to any future product candidates, we expect to rely on contract manufacturers for all our required raw materials, drug substance and drug product needs for preclinical research, clinical studies and commercial supply.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the

governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under both the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations; 
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 ▪approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the study is commenced; 
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 ▪preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for product candidates that are manufactured in biological systems like itolizumab (EQ001), or a New Drug Application, or NDA, for product candidates like EQ101 or EQ102 that are manufactured through chemical synthesis, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies; 
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to file the application for review; 
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and 
 ▪FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA or NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical study with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and PD characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical study. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical study can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical study.
Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical study conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical study must review and approve the plan for any clinical study and its informed consent form before the clinical study begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the study is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board,

which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical study if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
▪Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 ▪Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical studies may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical studies. 
 ▪Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical studies after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 clinical study may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA. Concurrent with clinical studies, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Submission, Review and Approval of a BLA or NDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA or NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Once a BLA or NDA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA or an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA or an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.

A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA or NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA or NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA or NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
Any marketing application for a new therapeutic product submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval.
A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA or NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA or NDA.
In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA or NDA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application fee.
A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA or NDA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, issuance by FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 ▪fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 


▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or 
 ▪injunctions, consent decrees or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 The co-development and validation of a diagnostic marker related to the CD6-ALCAM pathway and other urinary biomarkers for a companion diagnostic to identify LN patients most likely to respond to itolizumab (EQ001) will subject us and any diagnostic collaborator to device regulations of the FDA. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for itolizumab (EQ001) will utilize the PMA pathway.
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and clinical studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain

exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA (discussed below).
The federal false claims, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws, which can be enforced by private citizens, on behalf of the government, through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain

healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose requirements on covered entities, business associates and their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain biopharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.
In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, as defined by such law, other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical studies and other activities, and/or register their sales and medical representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit

certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare & Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.
Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
▪a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 ▪safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 ▪appropriate for the specific patient; 
 ▪cost-effective; and 
 ▪neither experimental nor investigational. 
 We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop. Additionally, we or our collaborators may develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our

product candidates. Companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of biopharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, which was passed into law in August 2022, included drug pricing reforms that have the potential to adversely impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and could lessen the real or perceived value of our product candidates, which would negatively impact our business. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
▪an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; 
 ▪an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; 
 ▪a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 ▪extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 ▪expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; 
 ▪expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program; 


▪a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
 ▪expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 
 ▪a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; 
 ▪requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals; 
 ▪a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; 
 ▪establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare & Medicaid spending; and 
 ▪a licensure framework for follow on biologic products. 
 There have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, the Trump administration signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.


Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control biopharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Government Regulations Related to Economic Sanctions
Pursuant to various laws, regulations, and executive orders, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions that prohibit or restrict certain activities with embargoed countries, sanctioned entities, and sanctioned individuals for particular foreign policy and national security reasons. The scope of the sanctions varies significantly, but may include comprehensive restrictions on imports, exports, investment, and facilitation of foreign transactions involving a sanctioned jurisdiction, entity or person, as well as non-sanctioned persons and entities acting on behalf of sanctioned jurisdictions, entities or people.
One such set of regulations is the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, or CACR. The CACR prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in virtually all transactions involving property of the government of Cuba or Cuban nationals, or property in which the government of Cuba or any Cuban national has at any time on or since July 8, 1963 had any interest of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect. Where activity is prohibited by the CACR, engagement in such activity must be authorized by a general or specific license granted by OFAC. The antibody sequence for both itolizumab (EQ001) and ALZUMAb was developed exclusively by Cuban nationals. We currently rely on a general license in the CACR, relating to Cuban-origin pharmaceuticals, to import and conduct clinical studies relating to itolizumab (EQ001).
In November 2019, OFAC notified us that after careful consideration, which included consultation with the FDA, OFAC determined that itolizumab falls within the definition of “Cuban-origin pharmaceutical” and, as such, the general licenses at section 515.547(b) and (c) of the CACR authorize the conduct of clinical studies for itolizumab for the purpose of seeking

approval for the drug from the FDA. Thus, no further authorization is required from OFAC at this time for our ongoing and planned clinical studies of itolizumab.
 Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 36 employees, all of whom were full-time and engaged in research and development activities, operations, finance, business development or administration. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed.
