 Business Overview
 Savara Inc. (together with its subsidiaries “Savara,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases. Our lead program, molgramostim nebulizer solution (“molgramostim"), is an inhaled biologic, specifically an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in Phase 3 development for autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (“aPAP”). Molgramostim is delivered via an investigational eFlow® Nebulizer System (PARI Pharma GmbH). Our management team has significant experience in orphan drug development and pulmonary medicine, identifying unmet needs, and effectively advancing product candidates to approval and commercialization.
Corporate Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leader in rare respiratory therapeutics through the development and commercialization of novel, best-in-class medicines that address unmet medical needs in this field. Key elements of our strategy include:
 •Continued advancement of the molgramostim aPAP program and the Phase 3 IMPALA-2 clinical trial. The IMPALA-2 trial design has been endorsed by regulatory authorities in the US (FDA), Europe (EMA), UK (MHRA), and Japan (PMDA), and regulatory and ethics committees in various countries and sites where the trial is being conducted. The dosing of the first patient was initiated on June 30, 2021, and we have continued to activate clinical trial sites and enroll patients in the trial.
 •Ensuring all aspects of our manufacturing are validated and can produce product at commercial scale. In additional to our primary drug substance manufacturer, GEMA Biotech S.A. ("GEMA"), in July 2022, we executed a master services agreement with an additional third-party biomanufacturing company, an integrated contract research and contract development company focused on cell- and gene-based therapies and large molecule biologics that provides a broad array of biologic manufacturing, analytical, and R&D services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, to serve as a potential second source manufacturer of molgramostim drug substances to attain uninterrupted drug substance supply and mitigate approvability risk.
 •Outsourcing capital-intensive operations. We will continue to pursue the development and manufacturing of our product candidate by outsourcing most clinical development work and manufacturing operations. We believe our business model enables the effective and capital-efficient development of our pipeline through the use of high-quality specialist vendors and consultants.
 Molgramostim – aPAP
 Our lead product candidate is an inhaled biologic. Molgramostim is an inhaled formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF and is being developed for the treatment of aPAP. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (“PAP”) is a rare lung disease characterized by the accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli (or air sacs) of the lungs. There are different types of PAP, of which aPAP is the most common.
 In May 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP. Fast Track Designation facilitates the development and expedites the review of new drugs or biologics intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. In December 2019, although the data from the IMPALA Phase 2/3 study, previously conducted by us and further described herein, did not meet the regulatory requirement for approval, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) for molgramostim in aPAP based on data from the 24-week double-blind treatment period from our IMPALA trial. Additionally, molgramostim was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of aPAP in the United States and the European Union (“EU”), which allows for seven and ten years of exclusivity from approval, respectively. Savara has exclusive access to the PARI eFlow® Nebulizer System for this indication along with a proprietary cell bank for molgramostim, a non-glycosylated inhaled form of GM-CSF. Additionally, In the United Kingdom (UK) molgramostim nebulizer solution for the treatment of aPAP was granted Innovation Passport (June 2022) and Promising Innovative Medicine (August 2022) designations by the UK MHRA. These designations provide the opportunity for enhanced dialogue and input from the MHRA and the Health Technology Assessment bodies in England, Scotland, and Wales.


In 2019, we announced that IMPALA, the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP, did not meet its primary endpoint of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, or (A-a)DO2, improvement compared to placebo. The totality of data from the IMPALA trial gives us confidence that molgramostim has the potential to address a significant unmet need in this rare disease. These data include:
 •multiple key secondary and exploratory endpoints that either achieved nominal statistical significance or trended in favor of the active drug arms;
 •results from the open-label period of the trial that demonstrated a sustained treatment effect, or continued improvement, after longer term exposure to molgramostim; additionally, patients who had been on placebo during the double-blind period of the trial and switched to treatment with molgramostim during the open-label period, showed improvements that eventually were generally similar to those seen in patients who received molgramostim during the double-blind period; and
 •molgramostim being generally well tolerated.
 In October 2020, results from the IMPALA trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We consider molgramostim to have a favorable risk-benefit profile and remain confident in the future of the program, including the current Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial.
 As of December 31, 2022, our Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, which builds on key learnings from the IMPALA trial remains on track. During 2021 and 2022, we activated many clinical trial sites and announced the dosing of our first patient occurred on June 30, 2021. Since that time, we have continued to enroll additional patients.
 We also received acceptance from the Pediatric Committee of the EMA for a proposed revised pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) for molgramostim.
 Detailed Program Description
 Molgramostim
 Background on aPAP
Autoimmune PAP, known as aPAP, is a specific disease belonging to a family of distinct rare lung diseases collectively referred to as PAP. aPAP represents about 90% of all patients with PAP and the estimated prevalence of PAP is six to seven cases per million people in the United States, with similar or higher prevalence reported elsewhere in the world. For example, Japan, a country that undertakes a more centralized approach to diagnosing and treating PAP, has seen a consistent increase in patients being diagnosed with the disease. It is now estimated the prevalence in Japan could be three to four times the original estimate of seven cases per million.
aPAP is characterized by the accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli, or air sacs, of the lungs. The surfactant consists of proteins and lipids and is an important physiological substance that lines the inside of the alveoli to prevent the lungs from collapsing. The lungs continuously produce new active surfactant. In a healthy lung, the surfactant is cleared by immune cells called alveolar macrophages. However, in lungs of patients with aPAP, the macrophages fail to clear the surfactant from the alveoli, leading to gradual accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli. The root cause of aPAP is an autoimmune response against GM-CSF, a naturally occurring protein in the body. Pulmonary macrophages need to be stimulated by GM-CSF to function properly, but in aPAP, GM-CSF is neutralized by antibodies against GM-CSF, rendering the macrophages unable to perform their tasks, including the clearance of surfactant from the alveoli.
 aPAP most commonly affects men in early middle age, but both sexes and people of any age can be affected. As a result of the accumulation of surfactant, gas exchange in the lungs is obstructed, and patients start to experience shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased exercise tolerance. Typically, shortness of breath is first observed upon exertion, but as the disease progresses, shortness of breath can be experienced even when a person is at rest. Patients may experience cough, sputum production, and episodes of fever, especially if secondary lung infection develops. In the long-term, the disease can lead to serious complications, including pulmonary fibrosis, and often potentially leading to the need for lung transplantation.
 Current treatment options for aPAP
 There is no approved medicine for the treatment of aPAP. The current standard-of-care for aPAP is a non-standardized procedure called Whole Lung Lavage (“WLL”), which entails washing out the lungs with saline, most commonly, one lung at a time, to physically remove excess surfactant from the lungs. The invasive and inconvenient procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves:
 •insertion of a double-lumen endobronchial tube for lung separation;
•repeated filling of the treated lung with up to 15-50 liters of saline;
 6


•percussion of the lung to emulsify the surfactant sediment; and
•draining the saline by gravity until the lavage fluid that is removed from the lung becomes clear.
 Potential complications from WLL include rib fracture, hypoxia, pneumothorax (collapsed lung), hydrothorax (fluid in pleural cavity), superimposed infection, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ("ARDS").
WLLs are performed by highly experienced physicians at specialist sites and necessitate hospitalization. In most patients, WLL may only provide temporary symptomatic relief. Once the lungs refill with surfactant, the WLL procedure needs to be repeated.
 As there are no approved pharmaceutical treatments available for aPAP, there is an unmet need for a convenient and efficacious medicinal treatment. We believe that inhalation of molgramostim activates macrophages in the lung alveoli, thus potentially restoring the surfactant-clearing activity of the alveolar macrophages and considerably improving oxygenation and exercise tolerance. Sargramostim (Leukine®), an injectable form of GM-CSF, is approved in the United States for intravenous (“IV”) and subcutaneous administration (“SC”) treatment of neutropenia caused by cancer chemotherapy and other related indications. Currently, there are no approved inhalation formulations of GM-CSF. GM-CSF products administered systemically (e.g., by injection), including molgramostim, are unlikely to benefit patients with aPAP because aPAP patients have circulating antibodies against GM-CSF. These antibodies would likely neutralize systemically administered GM-CSF before reaching the alveolar space in the lung.
 The potential benefits of inhaled GM-CSF in aPAP, together with the availability of sargramostim (Leukine®) for off-label compounding, have prompted independent clinicians and academic researchers in the United States, Europe, and Japan to study the safety and efficacy of inhaled GM-CSF in aPAP patients. In addition to our Phase 2/3 IMPALA trial of molgramostim, the largest completed placebo-controlled trial in this patient population (n=138), several investigator-sponsored, open-label clinical trials and case studies of inhaled GM-CSF treatment have been published, with promising results on the efficacy and safety of the treatment. In total, treatment of nearly 150 aPAP patients with inhaled GM-CSF has been reported in open-label trials or retrospective cohorts, as well as several individual case reports. In PAGE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 25-week clinical trial of inhaled sargramostim (Leukine®) in 64 patients with mild-to-moderate disease, a significant effect was observed in the primary endpoint, which was change from baseline in (A-a)DO2. Secondary endpoints, including changes from baseline in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (“DLCO”), six-minute walk distance (“6MWD”), and aPAP serum biomarkers, showed directional, but in most cases not statistically significant, treatment effects over placebo. Overall, for the first time, the PAGE trial showed in a placebo-controlled setting, proof-of-concept for GM-CSF inhalation therapy in aPAP. Results from these investigator-sponsored clinical trials and case studies indicate that GM-CSF may have a positive impact on oxygenation and clinical symptoms in aPAP patients. For details on the results of the IMPALA trial, please see the Clinical Development of Molgramostim – aPAP: Phase 2/3 IMPALA Trial section included in this report.
 According to our review of published literature, few safety issues related with GM-CSF inhalation in patients with aPAP have been reported. However, there is still limited information available on the long-term safety of inhaled GM-CSF.
Product Description
 Molgramostim is a non-glycosylated form of recombinant human GM-CSF that we are developing as an inhaled formulation for the treatment of aPAP. GM-CSF is an endogenous growth factor that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells (blood immune cells), mainly granulocytic and monocytic cells, which defend against bacteria and viruses, and clear cellular debris and waste substances from the body. Molgramostim is produced in a strain of Escherichia coli bearing a genetically engineered plasmid containing a human GM-CSF gene.
 Our product is a drug-device combination consisting of molgramostim nebulizer solution (drug component) and a vibrating mesh nebulizer (device component). Molgramostim nebulizer solution is vialed as a sterile formulation containing 300 µg of molgramostim in 1.2 mL solution. Molgramostim nebulizer solution is administered once daily by inhalation via a high efficiency nebulizer, the eFlow® Nebulizer System (PARI Pharma GmbH). The eFlow® Nebulizer System is a reusable electronic inhalation system that has been optimized for administration of molgramostim nebulizer solution. The eFlow® consists of a controller unit (AC or battery powered), a nebulizer handset, and a connection cord. The controller unit's lifespan is multiple years and the handset is replaced monthly with a new unit.
 Molgramostim was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in October 2012 and by the EMA in July 2013 for the treatment of aPAP. It was also granted Fast Track Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in May 2019 and December 2019, respectively. Further it was granted Innovation Passport (June 2022) and Promising Innovative
7


Medicine (August 2022) designations in the UK. Since 2014, molgramostim has been available in several European countries for the treatment of aPAP for named patients following unsolicited physician requests.
 We anticipate that molgramostim will be used as a long-term treatment in patients with aPAP. Treatment with molgramostim is expected to reduce or eliminate the need for WLL in patients with aPAP. In the IMPALA trial, a reduced number of WLL procedures in the active treatment arms was seen compared to the placebo treatment arm, but the difference was not statistically significant.
 Molgramostim Key Advantages
Based on data from the completed Phase 2/3 IMPALA trial and building upon the published investigator-sponsored treatment experience with inhaled GM-CSF, we believe molgramostim has the potential to become the treatment of choice for aPAP. The following characteristics of molgramostim may contribute to the clinical profile of the investigational product candidate, as well as facilitate potential regulatory approval and successful commercialization.
Specifically, molgramostim offers:
 •a strong product foundation that applies both a previously approved active drug substance class and drug delivery technology;
 •GM-CSF delivered directly to the lungs, the primary site of macrophage function deficiency in aPAP, which could result in clinical efficacy with limited systemic adverse effects;
 •a high-efficiency nebulizer that provides a fast and convenient method of administration; this is highly desirable for long-term treatment in a chronic disease, such as aPAP;
 •A low patient impact therapy that can be carried out in the home in 3 to 5 minutes each day using the portable eFlow nebulizer. 
 •eligibility for strong market protection via orphan drug status, potential eligibility for biologic exclusivity that provides twelve years of total market protection in the United States, and Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations;
 •a proprietary cell bank used in the production of the drug substance; and
 •an exclusive agreement for the specific device that is tailored for administration of molgramostim nebulizer solution.
 Clinical Development of Molgramostim – aPAP
 Phase 3 IMPALA-2 Trial
 


IMPALA-2 is a Phase 3, 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of molgramostim 300 µg administered once daily by inhalation with matching placebo in patients with aPAP. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in percent predicted DLCO, a gas exchange measure. Three secondary endpoints will evaluate clinical measures of direct patient benefit: St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (“SGRQ”) Total Score, SGRQ Activity Component Score, and exercise capacity using a treadmill test. Other efficacy endpoints will include (A-a)DO2 (another gas exchange measure), supplemental oxygen use, WLL frequency, patient and clinician global impression of disease severity and disease change, chest computed tomography (“CT”) scan to assess lung opacity, and blood biomarkers. IMPALA-2 is expected to enroll a total of approximately160 patients who will be randomized to receive treatment for 48 weeks in one of two arms: molgramostim 300 µg administered once daily or inhaled placebo administered once daily. The primary time point for efficacy assessment will be at week 24, however, efficacy will be assessed through week 48 to show durability of effect. Safety will be assessed through week 48. Following the 48-week double-blind treatment period, patients will roll over to a 48-week open-label period and will receive molgramostim 300 µg administered once daily.

In January 2021, we engaged Parexel International Limited (“Parexel”), a global contract research organization (“CRO”) to support our IMPALA-2 clinical trial operational activities. The IMPALA-2 trial design has been endorsed by regulatory authorities in the USA (FDA), Europe (EMA), UK (MHRA), and Japan (PMDA), and also by regulatory bodies and ethics committees in individual countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia where the trial is being conducted. We announced the first patient had been dosed on June 30, 2021, and since then we have continued to activate sites and enroll patients. The trial conduct is on track and projected top line data are expected by end of 2Q 2024. While we are working to complete the IMPALA-2 trial as quickly and as safely as possible, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging variants, as well as supply chain issues and geopolitical unrest in certain geographies, continues to evolve and may adversely impact trial timelines in the future.
 Phase 2/3 IMPALA Trial
 


IMPALA was a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of molgramostim in patients with aPAP. Conducted in 18 countries including the United States, Japan, and various European countries, it was the largest controlled clinical trial of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP. Patients were randomized to receive treatment for up to 24 weeks in one of three treatment arms: 1) molgramostim 300 µg administered once daily (“continuous dosing arm”), 2) molgramostim 300 µg and matching placebo administered daily every other week (“intermittent dosing arm”), or 3) inhaled placebo administered once daily. At the end of the 24-week double-blind period, all patients received molgramostim 300 ug administered daily in every other week intermittent cycles in a 24-week open-label follow up period. The primary endpoint of the trial was (A-a)DO2, gas exchange measure. In addition, three key secondary endpoints – SGRQ, 6MWD, and time to/requirement for WLL – along with multiple other exploratory endpoints were assessed to determine improvement in the disease pathology, pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, and function.
The pathogenesis of aPAP is well known and GM-CSF’s effect on the disease, as evaluated by (A-a)DO2, dyspnea, 6MWD, pulmonary function tests, CT scores, and biomarkers, is well documented through published clinical trials. While IMPALA did not meet its primary endpoint, when looking at the totality of evidence, we believe that data from the IMPALA trial demonstrated reversal of lung pathology and pathophysiology, improvement in clinical outcomes, and reduction of the need for rescue treatment, with a clear dose-frequency dependency in favor of the continuous dosing arm. Such results are detailed below:
 •Lung Pathology – Reversal of disease pathology and reduction of surfactant accumulation was demonstrated in the Full Analysis Set (“FAS”) population for (A-a)DO2 with improvement in CT scans as measured by Ground Glass Opacity scores. Results from IMPALA also demonstrated positive biomarker data, with improvements seen in most of the key biomarkers known to be associated with the severity of aPAP. 
 •Lung Pathophysiology – In the FAS population, an average (A-a)DO2 improvement of 12.1 mmHg was observed in the continuous dosing arm, compared to an average (A-a)DO2 improvement of 8.8 mmHg in the placebo arm. With an estimated 4.6 mmHg treatment difference, the trial did not meet its primary endpoint. Notably, one-third of patients in IMPALA were prescribed supplemental oxygen, continuously or as necessary, during the trial. The trial protocol recommended that supplemental oxygen not be used immediately before or during arterial blood sampling to minimize influence on (A-a)DO2 values. The protocol did allow patients to remain on supplemental oxygen during blood sampling if they could not tolerate discontinuation due to the severity of their respiratory condition. This was conditionally allowed only if they received the same oxygen flow rate used at baseline at all subsequent visits (n=4 patients, two in the placebo arm and one in each of the active arms). In these four patients, (A-a)DO2 values distributed quite differently compared to the remaining trial population – ranging from highly negative to highly positive. In a revised analysis that excluded these four patients, a statistically significant average (A-a)DO2 improvement was observed in the continuous dosing arm compared with the placebo arm.

Impaired gas transfer and oxygenation are key pathophysiologic features of aPAP and are associated with symptoms of shortness of breath and limitations in exercise capacity. In addition to (A-a)DO2, DLCO was assessed as a secondary endpoint to evaluate the efficacy of molgramostim on gas transfer. Patients in the continuous dosing arm showed a mean improvement of 11.6% predicted in DLCO, whereas the intermittent dosing and placebo arms showed a 7.7% predicted and 3.9% predicted improvement, respectively. The estimated treatment difference of 7.9% predicted (p=0.007) between the continuous dosing arm and placebo was statistically significant, and in keeping with the (A-a)DO2 improvement, and suggests improved gas exchange in the lungs.
 •Clinical Outcomes – An average improvement of 12.3 points in the SGRQ, a patient-reported outcomes/health status measure and a key secondary endpoint, was observed in the continuous dosing arm compared to an average improvement of 4.7 points in the placebo arm. The estimated treatment difference was 7.6 points, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The 6MWD, another key secondary endpoint, was numerically in favor of the continuous dosing arm, but the difference to placebo was not statistically significant. Patients in the continuous dosing arm showed a mean improvement of 39.6 meters in the 6MWD, while the intermittent and placebo arms showed improvements of 11.3 meters and 6.0 meters, respectively. The third key secondary endpoint was the requirement for WLL. Four patients in each of the active arms and six patients in the placebo arm underwent at least one WLL procedure during the treatment period. Given that some patients received more than one WLL, the total number of WLLs observed in the continuous dosing arm was nine, with seven observed in the intermittent dosing arm and 17 in the placebo arm. 
 •Consistency of Endpoints – A range of primary and secondary endpoints were selected to determine the potential treatment effect of molgramostim on aPAP. Patients in the continuous dosing arm demonstrated consistent improvements across all the key endpoints compared to placebo, with the majority of the measures achieving statistical significance. A dose-frequency dependency was observed, with continuous daily administration of molgramostim generally resulting in higher efficacy than intermittent dosing.
 •Safety and Tolerability – The percentage of patients with adverse events were similar in the treatment arms, except for the percentage of patients with chest pain, which was higher in the continuous dosing arm compared to placebo. 
 Results from the open-label period of the IMPALA trial, announced in March 2020, demonstrated a sustained treatment effect, or continued improvement, after longer term exposure to molgramostim. A summary of the results is provided below.
 •Patients who had been in the continuous dosing group during the double-blind period: 
 (A-a)DO2 improvement from baseline continued in these patients during the open-label period of the trial, with progressively larger improvements at weeks 48 and 72. Likewise, progressively larger improvements from baseline were observed in DLCO and SGRQ at weeks 48 and 72.
 •Patients who had been in the placebo group during the double-blind period:
 Placebo patients that transitioned to active drug showed similar average improvements in (A-a)DO2, DLCO, and SGRQ in the open-label period as compared to the continuous dosing group during the double-blind period, reaching similar levels of improvement to the continuous dosing group by week 72.
Similar trends were seen in the 6MWD at weeks 48 and 72, but the data were less conclusive.
 During the double-blind period of the trial, 33 WLL procedures were required, with nine in the continuous group compared to 17 in the placebo group and 7 were observed in the intermittent dosing arm. By contrast, during the 48-week open-label period of the trial, during which time all patients received active drug, five WLL procedures were conducted.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities to produce clinical or commercial quantities of our molgramostim product candidate. We have fee-for-service contracts with a drug substance manufacturer and drug product manufacturer that covers all steps of the manufacturing process of molgramostim. We expect to continue with this outsourcing model for the foreseeable future, and in July 2002, we engaged a second source manufacturer to reduce production risks and ensure drug substance supply. All of our manufacturing and supply vendors are certified by National Competent Authorities to operate under Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals; however, such manufacturing and supply vendors have not yet received an FDA inspection.


Molgramostim drug substance is currently manufactured by GEMA. All clinical and nonclinical trials to-date have used material sourced from GEMA and validation activities are ongoing to prepare for commercial manufacturing. Additionally, we have engaged an additional third-party as a second source for the manufacturing of molgramostim.
Patheon UK Limited in Ferentino, Italy (“Patheon”), a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., was selected as the commercial drug product manufacturer and also produces drug product for clinical supply. Technology transfer and process validation activities with Patheon were completed but will be re-executed in 2023 as Patheon moves the manufacturing of molgramostim drug product to a new filling line in the same facility.
Additionally, on December 21, 2022, we selected and engaged a third-party manufacturing services company as a second source to Patheon for the manufacturer of molgramostim. This third-party will provide a GMP Fill-Finish PPQ Campaign of the molgramostim drug product.
 Molgramostim is administered to the lungs using the eFlow® Nebulizer System, manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH in Stamberg, Germany (“PARI”). The eFlow® Nebulizer System has been Conformité Européenne (“CE”) certified (CE 0123) according to the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC) as a class IIa device. The device has a 510(k) approval in the United States as a general device. We have an exclusive license and a long-term supply agreement with PARI, as further discussed below, covering the eFlow® Nebulizer System for the administration of recombinant human GM-CSF.
 Commercialization
 Savara owns exclusive rights to molgramostim in the United States and all other major markets. We continue to pursue clinical and regulatory approvals for molgramostim. In doing so, we may engage with strategic partners to collaborate on implementing optimal sales and promotion activities. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and centers, as well as provide patients with support programs to ensure product access. Pending EMA approval, we expect to commercialize molgramostim in the EU and may engage with strategic partners to optimize sales and promotion activities in other EU territories.
Key License and Other Agreements
 Parexel
 We entered into an MSA with Parexel on March 5, 2021, pursuant to which Parexel provides contract research services related to our clinical trials. The MSA has an initial term of five years. We may terminate the MSA and/or any work order without cause on 60 days’ prior written notice to Parexel. Either party may terminate the MSA or any work order, and Parexel may suspend the performance of services for a material uncured breach by the other party. In addition, either party may immediately terminate the Agreement and/or any individual work order on prior written notice if (a) continuation of the services would pose an undue risk to the health and/or wellbeing of a study participant, (b) any certificate, authorization, approval or exemption from a regulatory authority required for the conduct of the services is revoked, suspended, or expires without renewal, (c) in the reasonable opinion of such party, the continuation of the services would be in violation of applicable law, or (d) the other party becomes insolvent. Concurrent with entering the MSA, we executed a work order with Parexel, under which Parexel will provide services related to the IMPALA-2 trial. As of December 31, 2022, under that work order, we expect to pay Parexel service fees and pass-through expenses estimated to be approximately between $17 million and $20 million over the remainder of the IMPALA-2 clinical trial assuming no additional change orders or material changes to the MSA and statements of works.
 PARI Pharma GmbH
 We have a license and collaboration agreement related to molgramostim with PARI Pharma GmbH (the “PARI License Agreement”). Under the PARI License Agreement, we have a worldwide, exclusive license to commercialize PARI’s eFlow Nebulizer System for the pulmonary delivery of any liquid formulation containing human GM-CSF (“hGM-CSF”) as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient for nebulization for aPAP.

 GEMA Biotech S.A.
 In April 2019, we entered into a Manufacture and Supply Agreement with GEMA, which was amended on December 7, 2022 (the “GEMA Agreement”), pursuant to which GEMA will supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for molgramostim exclusively to us for commercial sale and continue to supply the API to us for clinical trials and research and development activities. Additionally, GEMA transferred and assigned to us all rights, titles, and interest in and to the master cell bank and working cell bank necessary to produce the API.
 Pursuant to the terms of the GEMA Agreement, GEMA agreed to undertake the actions required to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other similar regulatory authorities and obtain the approvals necessary to manufacture and supply the API to us for commercial sale.
 In addition to an agreed upon price of the API, we paid GEMA a milestone payment upon the effective date of the agreement and are required to make milestone payments upon (i) completion of certain developmental activities, (ii) successful completion of an audit by the FDA, and (iii) marketing approval of a product containing the API. If we successfully commercialize a product containing the API in a country, we must pay GEMA a single digit percentage royalty on annual net sales. We are obligated to make such royalty payments until the earlier of (i) 10 years after the first receipt of marketing approval for the product in that country or (ii) the date a biosimilar of such product is first sold in that country.
The term of the GEMA Agreement, continues until the twentieth anniversary of the date of receipt of marketing approval for a product containing the API in any country and may be extended for additional twelve-month terms by the agreement of both parties. We may terminate the GEMA Agreement immediately if (i) products containing the API will not be sold or will be withdrawn from the market, (ii) the FDA or other regulatory authority withdraws marketing approval for or fails to approve products incorporating the API, (iii) three or more batches of API supplied in any six month period fail to conform to specifications, (iv) GEMA receives notice of deficiencies in its manufacturing and fails to adequately respond, or (v) GEMA fails to achieve compliance with the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities necessary to manufacture and supply the API to us for commercial sale.
 Patheon UK Limited
 We have entered into an agreement and related work orders with Patheon under which Patheon manufactures our molgramostim product candidate for clinical trials. We may terminate the agreement at any time for any business reason.
 In June 2019, we entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Master Manufacturing Agreement”) with Patheon and expect in the future to enter into one or more related Product Agreements (each a “Product Agreement) pursuant to the Master Manufacturing Agreement to govern the terms and conditions of Patheon’s manufacture of commercial supplies of molgramostim.
 The Master Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term ending December 31, 2024, and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years each if there is a Product Agreement in effect, unless a party has given notice of termination. Either party may terminate the Master Manufacturing Agreement upon the other party’s uncured

material breach or insolvency. Patheon may terminate the Master Manufacturing Agreement if we assign such agreement to an assignee that is unacceptable to Patheon for certain reasons, for failure of our timely payment of invoices, or if we forecast zero volume for six months.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drugs, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidate. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Government Regulation of Drugs
 United States
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates, like ours, may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulation;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee for each clinical site before a clinical trial can begin;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), after completion of all required clinical trials;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”); and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidate will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro trials assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other

things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Additionally, in certain instances, a fourth phase, post approval, may be necessary or required.
 •Phase 1. The drug product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 •Phase 2. The drug product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
 •Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. Phase 4 trials may be required as a condition to approval of the BLA.
 Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the drug characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including trials initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. As noted previously, molgramostim nebulizer solution for the treatment of aPAP has been granted Orphan Drug Designation, and as such is exempt from the payment of User Fees under current legislation.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for the indication being pursued, and the facility in which it is manufactured,

processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety and effectiveness. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or our drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-marketing trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing trials. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of its products under development.
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for Fast Track Designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing trials or completion of ongoing trials after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the

development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.
 Fast Track Designation, priority review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 The review and approval process with respect to our drug candidate may also be significantly delayed in the event of government shutdowns, if any.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.
 Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or potentially require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated, or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of a BLA if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-marketing trials or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions

of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Government Regulation of Combination Products
 Our product candidate under development will be regulated as a combination product, which means that it is comprised of two or more different components that, if marketed individually, would be subject to different regulatory paths and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center within the FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. We believe our product candidate includes both a drug and medical device component, and will be regulated as a drug, subject to the review of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research which will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development and approval. The FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health will provide support and review of the nebulizer component of our product candidate.
European Union
 MAA
 To obtain approval of a drug under the EU regulatory system, an application for a marketing authorization may be submitted under a centralized, a decentralized, or a national procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes or for orphan drugs, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states, which grants the same rights and obligations in each member state as a national marketing authorization. As a general rule, only one marketing authorization may be granted for drugs approved through the centralized procedure and the marketing authorization is also relevant for the EEA countries.
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. On day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur designated by the CHMP, it adopts a list of questions, which are sent to the applicant together with the CHMP's overall conclusions. Applicants then have three months to respond (plus an additional three-month extension, if requested). The applicant's replies are assessed, and the assessment report is revised as necessary (and may include a prepared list of outstanding issues). By day 180 of the procedures, the revised assessment report and list of outstanding issues are sent to the applicant together with the CHMP's recommendation. Applicants then have one month to respond to the CHMP (and can request a one or two-month extension). The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur assess the applicant's replies and then submit them for review to the CHMP and prepare a final assessment report. Following their evaluation, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the marketing authorization. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the Standing Committee of the Member States. The European Commission prepares a draft decision and circulates it to the member states; if the draft decision differs from the CHMP opinion, the Commission must provide detailed explanations. The European Commission adopts a decision within 15 days of the end of the consultation procedure.
 Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) the applicant will likely be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.
 Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis, until the holder provides a comprehensive data package. Grant of conditional marketing authorization is dependent on the applicant's ability to fulfill the conditions within an agreed upon deadline. Applicants are subject to conditions, including the requirement to complete ongoing studies or to conduct new studies with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive or to fulfill specific obligations in relation to pharmacovigilance. Once a comprehensive data package has been supplied, the conditional marketing authorization is replaced by a regular marketing authorization.

Exclusivities
 If an approved drug contains a new active substance, it is protected by data exclusivity for eight years from the notification of the Commission decision granting the marketing authorization and then by marketing protection for an additional two or three years. Overall, the drug is protected for ten or eleven years against generic competition, and no additional exclusivity protection is granted for any new development of the active substance it contains.
 During the eight-year period of data exclusivity, competitors may not refer to the marketing authorization dossier of the approved drug for regulatory purposes. During the period of marketing protection, competitors may not market their generic drugs. The period of marketing protection is normally two years but may become three years if, during the eight-year data exclusivity period, a new therapeutic indication is approved that is considered as bringing a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies.
 Japan
 Under the Japanese regulatory system administered by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (“PMDA”) (which is responsible for product review and evaluations under the supervision of the MHLW), pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. The Law on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (Act No. 145 of 1960) requires a license for marketing authorization when importing to Japan and selling pharmaceutical products manufactured in other countries. It also requires each manufacturing site of a foreign manufacturer to be certified as a manufacturing site of pharmaceutical products to be marketed in Japan.
To receive a license for marketing authorization, the manufacturer or seller must, at the very least, employ certain manufacturing, marketing, quality, and safety personnel. If the quality management methods and post marketing safety management methods applied with respect to the pharmaceutical product fail to conform to the standards stipulated by the MHLWA license, marketing authorization may not be granted. A company must submit an application for approval to the MHLW with results of nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy, and safety of the product candidate to obtain manufacturing/marketing approval for a new product. A data compliance review, on-site inspection for good clinical practice, and audit and detailed data review for compliance with current good manufacturing practices are undertaken by the PMDA. The committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council will discuss each application, and based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by the MHLW. The approval process timeline significantly varies, but it can take years. Pricing approval for the product is required in order to be applied for redemption of health insurance. Once approved and marketable, the medical products are also subject to regular post-marketing vigilance of safety and quality under the standards of Good Manufacturing Practice. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the MHLW sets the prices of the products on this list. Upon marketing approval, the manufacturer or seller begins negotiations regarding the reimbursement price with the MHLW, which is generally determined within 60 to 90 days. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.
Orphan Drug Status
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a drug candidate that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.


Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidate for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
 The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
 Breakthrough Designation
 In December 2019, the FDA granted the use of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP program Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which provides a process for expediting the development and review of drug candidates that are intended to treat a serious condition and for which preliminary evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over the available therapy.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs and interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to increased scrutiny and review if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct illegal per se under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers.
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the FCA, impose liability on persons and/or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual, or whistleblower, in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million

and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our products, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, known as “Open Payments” and implemented as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year.
On October 24, 2018, former President Trump signed into law the “Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act” which in part (under a provision entitled “Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine”) extends the reporting and transparency requirements under Open Payments to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 We are also subject to data privacy and security regulation by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business and the EU with the General Data Protection Regulation rules which became effective in May 2018. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses (collectively, “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to them, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.


In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have adopted an anti-corruption policy which mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect against intentional, reckless, or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators, or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payers. Third-party payers include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payers will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidate, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical trials to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidate that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for third-party payers to seek coverage and reimbursement. Thus, one payer’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payer will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow third-party payers to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could materially affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidate are:
 •an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
 •an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
 •a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
 •a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 •extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;


•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidate, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. It is unclear how this such effort to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the healthcare industry or our business operations. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.
 Other Foreign Regulations
 In addition to regulations mentioned above, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidate and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture and any other technology to which we have rights, as appropriate, such as device exclusivity. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 Our success will, in part, depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets as well as our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We cannot be sure patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our processes and proprietary technology portfolio are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. While we have confidence in our key individuals, consultants, partner

organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and there may not be adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to continuous technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidate will be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of our potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than us, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidate, manufacturing, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be faster and more successful in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of very capable competitors. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses.
 We are not aware of any other companies developing an inhaled form of GM-CSF. A glycosylated GM-CSF product, sargramostim (Leukine®), is available on the market in the United States, approved for IV or SC delivery in patients with neutropenia following cancer chemotherapy. Leukine® has not been approved for the treatment of aPAP or any other acute or chronic lung disease but is sometimes used as a pharmacy-compounded product (injectable product compounded for inhalation delivery). The drug substance in Leukine®, sargramostim, has been used in a nonclinical research project conducted by NIH/TRND in collaboration with the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine on the potential application of inhaled GM-CSF as a treatment for aPAP. No clinical trials have been conducted to date under this collaboration project. We are aware of a multicenter clinical trial of inhaled Leukine®, using a standard commercially available nebulizer, which was conducted by a consortium of independent clinical investigators from the trial conducted in Japan. It is not known to us if this trial, together with other possibly available related clinical or nonclinical information, may be, or will be, used to support a potential new product approval in Japan. If such a new product would be approved and launched in Japan, we believe it has the potential to present a material competitive threat to the commercial success of molgramostim in Japan. In addition, in November 2018, Partner Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial biotechnology company, was granted Orphan Drug Designation for Leukine® for the treatment of PAP by the FDA.
Employees and Human Capital
 We are committed to attracting and retaining the best possible talent. As of March 30, 2023, we had 28 employees as well as several third-party consultants. All employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Attraction, Development and Retention
 We believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Our compensation program, including salary, bonus, benefits as well as short and long-term incentives, is designed to help us to attract and retain individuals whose skills are important to our current and long-term success. Our total compensation package is generally positioned within the competitive ranges of our peer market, with differences generally based on tenure, skills, and performance needed to attract and retain key talent. We have also implemented a spot bonus program that allows employees to nominate their colleagues for cash awards in recognition of notable achievements.
We believe that continued professional growth and development are essential to helping our team stay on top of current rules, laws, trends, and events which impact their duties. We seek to develop our employee talent within the organization through access to training, continuous learning programs, and other development initiatives. We foster a culture of empowerment, transparency, and respect.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We value diverse backgrounds and viewpoints and are committed to equal opportunity. We aim to recruit, hire, place, develop, compensate, and advance people based on the needs of our organization and the qualifications, performance, skills, and experience of our people. We expect to continue to enhance our workforce diversity and advance the development of diverse talent. We consistently evaluate the opportunity for diversity for both our employee workforce and our board of directors. Upon beginning employment with Savara, all employees receive training on workplace diversity and inclusion.
Health and Safety
 The health and safety of our employees is a top priority, and our goal is to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all personnel. In dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging variants, we have provided our employees the ability to work virtually in order to best manage business and personal responsibilities. We will continue to manage this situation with a focus towards the safety of our employees.
