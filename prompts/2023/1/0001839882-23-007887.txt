Item 1. General
Company Background
 
Nanophase Technologies Corporation (“Nanophase,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Solésence, LLC (our “Solésence beauty science subsidiary”), is a leading innovator in minerals-based and scientifically-driven health care solutions across beauty and life science categories, protecting skin from environmental aggressors and aiding in medical diagnostics. Skin health and medical diagnostics combined currently make up the great majority of our business and drive our forward growth strategy, with additional revenue being generated from other legacy advanced materials applications. The Company was incorporated in Illinois on November 25, 1989 and became a Delaware corporation during November 1997. Our common stock trades on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol NANX. We have development and application laboratories, and manufacturing capacity in three locations in the Chicago, Illinois area.
 
Leveraging a platform of integrated patented and proprietary technologies, we create products with unique performance to enhance end-consumers’ health and well-being. We offer soup-to-nuts production, from engineered materials, formulation development, and finished product development, to commercial manufacturing and packaging capabilities. Our expertise in materials engineering allows us to effectively coat and disperse materials on a nano and “non-nano” scale for use in a variety of markets in skin health, including for use in sunscreens as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) and as fully developed prestige skin care products, marketed and sold through our Solésence beauty science subsidiary. We believe that we have developed technological advantages with respect to our APIs sold for use as ingredients, while our Solésence beauty science technologies lead to enhanced efficacy and aesthetics in our finished products, which have received broad acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the enhanced efficacy and aesthetic qualities offered by our proprietary technology platform, Solésence finished products satisfy growing consumer demands around “clean” and inclusive beauty. Solésence beauty science also benefits from the Company’s vertical integration with each product’s key active ingredient that delivers its point-of-difference. This vertical integration helps us to improve efficiency and avoid potential major supply chain challenges while also addressing ongoing sustainability efforts. 
 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) testing for various viruses, most notably SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”), has become a critical use of our technology in the life science space. Through our medical diagnostics materials, we have been able to support efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our deep expertise in materials science has created advantages that enable performance in certain tests that may not be achievable through other materials. Outside of life science, we continue to sell advanced materials for use in legacy applications, all of which, along with medical diagnostics, currently fall into the advanced materials product category. 
 
Given our technological position, in addition to the historical market acceptance of our APIs for use in skin health products and sunscreens, rapidly growing sales for our suite of Solésence® finished products, and the expanded use of our diagnostic materials in aiding the fight to curb the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses, in 2021 we announced that we reoriented our Company strategy. We continue to see unprecedented demand in both beauty science, for our APIs and finished products, and life science areas. The markets for both have shown an appetite for what we are producing, and management believes that this growth is happening now due to a confluence of our technology, market conditions that favor what we produce, and our expanded expertise in these areas.  
 
Nanophase, primarily through Solésence, now partners with brands to develop, manufacture, and market products and ingredients that enhance lives through healthy skin. We are focusing our combined business-, ingredient-, and product-development capabilities on products with unique performance in this area. While we will continue to produce and sell materials to our other advanced materials customers, it is not our strategic focus. We may develop additional technologies, or find unique applications outside of our core markets in the future, but to maximize the use of our resources today, we plan on expanding efforts in areas where we have proven we can deliver innovation and growth.
 
Solésence Beauty Science Business 
 
In 2020, Solésence beauty science finished products surpassed our personal care ingredients business in terms of total revenue, and in 2021 and 2022, Solésence beauty science more than doubled our revenue from personal care ingredients. We believe that Solésence offers the greatest growth potential of any group of products in any market in the Company’s history. Our volumes are continuing to grow, limited mainly by our capacity. We expect our Solésence volume, based on 2023 shipments and customer orders in-hand, to exceed full year 2022 volume.  
 
The extent to which we grow will be dependent upon our ability to effectively expand our capabilities during 2023. As a result, we plan to continue investments in facilities and equipment as well as in human resources, in 2023 and beyond. We are prioritizing facilities expansion, and capital investment in this business to allow for continued growth, and increased profitability.

During 2015 we were granted a patent on a new type of particle surface treatment (coating) — now called Active Stress Defense™ Technology — which has become the cornerstone of our new product development in our Solésence business, with first revenue recognized during 2017. We now offer a suite of three technologies under our Active Stress Defense™ platform, each of which offers a distinct market advantage in terms of performance, aesthetics, and/or “clean” positioning in UV and environmental protection, with flexible formulas that allow for adoption by a range of brands with different market positions. We continue to develop and expand our in-house formulating capability, through which we have created, and now sold, more than 250 SKUs of fully formulated finished cosmetics products in markets focused on skin health, with the majority in prestige beauty. Products developed and sold by our Solésence beauty science subsidiary are all produced under the requirements of current Good Manufacturing Standards (“cGMP”), as enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which enables us to leverage the expertise we developed in the manufacture of personal care ingredients. Although our Solésence products are fully formulated for consumer use, we do not sell directly to consumers or distribute products to consumers under the Solésence® brand through intermediaries or resellers. Instead, we sell our Solésence® products to brand partners as market-ready products, as customized white label products, or as custom-developed products, in each case, for sale or distribution to consumers under our customers’ brand names. In 2022, Solésence (through Nanophase, as its parent company) was granted site clearance by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) for the full finished product manufacture of creams, lotions, sprays, sticks and all topical sunscreen forms. TGA site clearance is legally required for brands to market Solésence-made products as primary sunscreens in Australia. Our initial focus continues to be on establishing a footprint with both new and existing Solésence brand partners, to enable the sale of our patented skin health products as primary sunscreens. Also in 2022, Nanophase was granted a patent in Korea for the Kleair™ technology used exclusively in Solésence products. Shortly thereafter, Solésence Beauty Science received two industry accolades. In July at Cosmoprof North America, Solésence was awarded the Cosmopack Award for best Formulation for its product Multi-Cultural Magic SPF 50+ Featuring Kleair™ technology, acknowledging the Company’s technology, formulation and marketing know-how. In September, Solésence was awarded the Cosmetics & Toiletries Allē Award for Most Significant Active Ingredient in Sun/Light Protection for Kleair™ technology, a further acknowledgement of the company’s technology know-how, as well as a recognition for the Company in the areas of innovation and impact. In early 2023, Solésence was named number 2 on Fast Company’s Most Innovative Beauty Businesses list. This is a prestigious award that recognizes the impact we have on the industry we serve and the lives of the people who use our products. 
 
Personal Care Ingredients Business
 
Prior to 2020, our largest line of business had been the manufacture and sale of APIs in the skin health and sun care markets, which we deliver to customers through strategic partnerships. We continue to manufacture and supply hundreds of metric tons of surface engineered zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to our customers annually, and these are used by major global consumer products companies for sunscreens and skin health-focused personal care products. We produce these products using proprietary coating and dispersion technologies that comply with the requirements of cGMP and are classified as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, or APIs, by the FDA. We believe we have opportunities for growth in API sales in 2023.
Advanced Materials Business
 
Our third line of business has been the manufacture and sale of advanced nanoparticle materials, including a material used in life science applications to enhance the performance of PCR test methods. Given the high level of demand for our medical diagnostics material during 2020 and 2021, this composes the majority of our advanced materials business. We continue to service other profitable markets where we have had a degree of success in the past, including applications in food packaging, coatings and optical polishing, but our strategic focus and related future development is in the area of improving the health for all human beings, and any related applications that may be created as we work to develop future materials to satisfy this growing area.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Most of the raw materials we use are readily commercially available. In some cases, we rely on sole-source processors of materials that utilize an array of worldwide sources for the raw materials that they process to our specifications. However, we require very high purity zinc for our personal care applications that have occasionally seen shortages in prior years. Although we currently believe we have developed adequate commercial relationships to supply the necessary raw materials for our business which are not readily commercially available, our business is subject to the pricing and availability of certain raw materials.
 
Some of the raw materials that are critical to the production of our products and parts that are critical to the operation of our equipment are sourced from single suppliers, suppliers from China and Korea, and in some cases, a single supplier from China. In 2022 we continue to monitor delays in shipping exports from China and Korea. Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we do not anticipate any directly related supply disruptions as we do not knowingly source any materials directly from either country. Additionally, we could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business operations or that are beyond our control, including but not limited to international trade restrictions and conditions related to COVID-19 or other epidemics. We typically maintain no less than one month’s supply of raw materials and parts that are sourced from sole suppliers and make efforts to identify additional suppliers who may be able to provide such raw materials or parts.

Markets and Distribution
 
Solésence Beauty Science Business
 
We partner with brands on a global basis to develop, manufacture and market products that enhance lives through healthy skin. These products are fully-formulated solutions built around proprietary Solésence technologies, which are designed to improve skin health for all human beings, and are aligned with consumer demand for “clean” and inclusive beauty products that enhance skin health. Solésence clients, or brand partners, are positioned in skin care, makeup/cosmetics, and sun care markets, with the majority of our partners operating in the prestige beauty segment with retail, direct-to-consumer, and/or omnichannel strategies. This represents a move downstream from our previous position — one of providing ingredients to manufacturers — to offering finished products that we believe offer a clear and distinct market advantage relative to both aesthetics and performance. With our first Solésence beauty science product revenue recognized during 2017, we had our first material amounts of Solésence product revenue in 2018, and saw significant expansion in these sales through 2022. Solésence brand partners have experienced strong growth as our products have seen broad acceptance from retailers, adoption by consumers, and recognition by third-party media outlets through awards and accolades. We expect our Solésence beauty science business to enhance both our degree of control of the business development cycle, and to further enable our ability to grow rapidly. 
Personal Care Ingredients Business
 
In addition to serving strategic partners in diverse markets and geographic locations, we will continue to devote significant resources to maintaining and growing our relationship with BASF Corporation (“BASF”), the largest customer in our personal care ingredients line of business. This has been a successful relationship that we expect will contribute to our future growth. BASF, which describes itself as the world’s leading chemical company with annual revenue of approximately $79 billion, is a “globally leading supplier of sustainable high-performance ingredients for the personal care industry,” with recognized brands, significant revenue, and a broad sales network. BASF is primarily responsible for the business development cycle and maintains the direct customer relationships. We have a long-term exclusive relationship with BASF, primarily to provide nano-scale specific zinc oxide-based products made to specific specifications to be used in personal care cosmetics, with sunscreens and daily wear products being the dominant applications. 
 
On August 9, 2022 BASF filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The New Jersey Complaint claims that Nanophase breached the parties’ 1999 Zinc Oxide Supply Agreement. For additional information about the complaint see Item 3. Legal proceedings.
 
Advanced Materials Business
 
Our technologies for engineering and manufacturing life science materials and other nanomaterials, and our understanding of how to make nano-scale and other advanced materials exhibit desirable performance characteristics in various media, have resulted in commercial materials solutions that we believe offer superior performance in many applications. Medical diagnostics, which we view as being a life science application, was the largest market for our advanced materials business from 2020 through 2022, and we expect this to be true for the foreseeable future. This is a key area of focus in advanced materials in terms of new business development.  Our legacy markets for advanced materials include architectural coatings, surface treatment (polishing), plastics additives, textiles applications, and others. As advanced materials markets continue to develop and grow, we believe that customers’ preferred delivery formats will often be dispersed and/or coated nanomaterials for life science applications. We believe we are well-positioned with our platform of integrated commercial nanomaterial technologies to respond to this demand, although outside of life science areas, we are currently not actively developing new business in this area.Research and Development
 
Most of our research and development over the past few years has been directly related to Solésence beauty science product and personal care ingredient applications development. We endeavor to either meet specific customer needs or to develop applications solutions to address unmet needs in a particular market where we believe our materials will offer a distinct performance advantage. Our efforts in research and development, cosmetic formulating, process engineering and advanced engineering groups are focused in three major areas: 1) application development for our products; 2) creating or obtaining additional core materials technologies and/or materials that have the capability to serve multiple beauty or life science markets; and 3) continuing to improve our core technologies to improve manufacturing operations and reduce costs.
 
Our total research and development expense, which includes all expenses relating to our technology and advanced engineering groups, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $3.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively. This represents our share of these expenses only and does not take into account amounts spent by any of our customers in support of new product development. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to develop products which bring a high degree of value to our customers’ products. Through the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, we had cumulative research and development expenses of approximately $6.8 million and related cumulative expenditures on equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately $0.2 million.

Competitive Advantage
 
In our Solésence beauty science business, our Active Stress Defense™ platform of proprietary technologies – which includes Kleair™ – offers unique skin health benefits through performance-related and aesthetic advantages in environmental protection skin health products, including in UVA/UVB, pollution and HEV (blue) light protection. These technologies expand access to healthy skin by improving both the product experience across the full range of skin tones while also leveraging a unique versatility that enables a variety of novel formats to reach the full range of product preferences and lifestyles. By combining our market awareness, proprietary dispersion capabilities and formulation know-how, our Solésence products enable our brand partners to expand the range of products within skin care and color cosmetics categories that can include sun and environmental protection, and their products consequently fill a unique market segment which drives the growing demand for our Solésence products.
 
In our personal care ingredients business, we believe that targeted collaborations with our long-standing customers in the ingredients space will enable them to have a competitive advantage which will sustain and/or grow their market share in the sunscreen API market. Both the Solesence® beauty science business and the personal care ingredients business have been positively impacted by the growing interest among consumers for mineral-based sunscreens, which management sees as a validation of the Company strategy.
 
In our advanced materials business, we have created an integrated platform of commercial nanomaterial technologies that are patented, patent-pending or proprietary, and result in products that see end use in a variety of applications, including use in enhancing the performance of PCR testing for various viruses, including COVID-19. These technologies revolve around our two distinct manufacturing process (PVS – Plasma Vapor Synthesis and NAS – NanoArc® Synthesis) and are designed to deliver nano- and advanced-materials solutions for a targeted market or a specific customer application. Our platform provides flexibility and capability to engineer nanomaterials that meet a customer’s performance requirements and delivers our nanomaterial solutions in a readily usable format. Our technologies are scalable and robust, having allowed us to produce up to several hundred metric tons in this segment annually.
 
Manufacturing Operations   
 
We currently have manufacturing capacity based in three locations in the Chicago area. At two of these facilities, we are able to develop and supply engineered materials and bulk finished goods in quantities ranging from grams to metric tons. Our two existing facilities are registered under the ISO 9001, American National Standard, Quality Management System Requirements, and ISO 14001, American National Standard, Environmental Management System Requirements.  We are compliant with cGMP for products under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulation, applying to the manufacture of APIs and OTC Finished Dosage Form materials (primarily used in sun protection). Our third facility, our newest and also in the Chicago area, is compliant with cGMP for products under FDA regulation, applying to the manufacture of APIs and OTC Finished Dosage Form materials (primarily used in sun protection) and we expect to have similar capabilities and registrations as those in our two other manufacturing facilities by the end of 2023. We have registered some of the chemicals we ship to customers in Europe pursuant to the European Chemical Agency’s regulations issued to date pertaining to Registration Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”). Currently, we have registered Zinc Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Iron Oxide and Octyltrimethoxysilane under REACH.
 
Our operations employ a cellular, team-based manufacturing approach, where workers operate in work “cells,” under a lean manufacturing environment to continuously advance and improve production capabilities. We have also developed a highly flexible workforce that has been cross trained to allow it to be employed broadly across our manufacturing processes. Beginning in late 2019, we also began to employ a significant number of temporary operators to assist us in supporting the production of our Solésence products.  Our manufacturing approach, targeted engineering actions, and capital investment have resulted in continuing process innovations and improvements that have reduced the variable manufacturing cost significantly over the past several years, while increasing our capacity to meet demand.
 
We are committed to a Lean Six Sigma manufacturing approach, to the extent possible given a certain measure of irregular demand, where we are able to reduce excess labor and manage the lowest practical inventory and supply levels in order to minimize working capital demands. This approach complements two of our major operational goals - (1) to increase output without adding unnecessarily to existing equipment and (2) to continually reduce production costs while consistently producing high quality products.
 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property. In addition to obtaining patent and trademarks based on our inventions and products, we may also license certain third-party patents from time-to-time to expand our technology base.

As of the date of this filing, we own 10 U.S. patents and 8 pending U.S. patent applications. We also own 56 foreign patents and patent applications consisting of 35 issued or allowed foreign patents and 21 pending foreign patent applications. All of the pending and owned foreign patents are counterparts to domestic filings covering our platform of nanotechnologies and surface treatments.
 
Competition
 
Within each of our targeted markets and product applications, we face potential competition from contract manufacturers and developers, advanced materials and chemical companies, and suppliers of traditional materials. In many markets, the actual or potential competitors are larger and more diversified than we are; however, we believe we focus on market segments and opportunities where our materials and related technologies are superior to those of our competitors, often due to our abilities to produce highly engineered ingredients to meet specific performance requirements, develop advanced material solutions for customers’ specific applications, and in the case of Solésence, finished products that impart the benefits of minerals-based products with superior tactile, visual, and performance characteristics.

With respect to traditional suppliers, we may compete against lower priced traditional materials for certain customer applications. In some product or process applications the benefits of using advanced materials do not always justify a process change or outweigh their frequently higher costs. 
 
We believe that our material technologies and manufacturing platforms are strong. We believe we are well-positioned with our platform of integrated commercial materials technologies and track record of technology improvement and evolution.
 
In addition to competition in the advanced materials and related markets, our Solésence beauty science subsidiary faces competition from a wide variety of offerings in the field of skin care. Our Solésence products compete with existing solutions as well as new solutions from various sources, including other product developers and manufacturers who seek to serve skin care brands and integrated brands who also manufacture their own products in-house, and we must differentiate our value proposition in order to gain traction in this marketplace. The complexities of sunscreen regulation and the nuances of the development and manufacture of sunscreen products present a barrier for brands with integrated manufacturing in other skin care and cosmetics areas. Still, several Solésence customers have internal development and manufacturing capabilities that are similar to the capabilities of Solésence, and can serve as indirect competition to our products and services. We believe that our Solésence beauty science technology and our expertise in the nuances of formulating products that contain UV protection, coupled with our expanding capability to produce novel formats, will allow us to become a competitive player in this market on a sustainable basis. 
 
Governmental Regulations, Including Climate Change 
 
The manufacture and use of certain of the products that contain Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients are subject to governmental regulations. As a result, we are required to adhere to the cGMP requirements of the FDA and similar regulations that include testing, control and documentation requirements enforced by periodic inspections. We also comply with the European Chemical Agency’s regulations issued to date pertaining to the chemicals we have registered under REACH. In early 2022, we were granted site clearance by Australia’s TGA for the full finished product manufacture of creams, lotions, sprays, sticks and all topical sunscreen forms. TGA site clearance is legally required for brands to market Solésence-made products as primary sunscreens in Australia. Our initial focus will be on establishing a footprint with both new and existing Solésence brand partners, to enable the sale of our patented skin health products as primary sunscreens.
 
We are committed to environmental health and safety (“EH&S”). We believe we comply with all applicable exposure limit standards issued by the United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“OSHA”). Because nanotechnology remains an emerging and evolving science, there are no currently accepted standards, measurements or personal protective equipment available that are specific to nanoparticle safety. Accordingly, we rely on general chemical safety and process safety practices to identify safe personal protective equipment and appropriate handling protocols. We believe that we have taken a leadership position on EH&S in our operations and have internal and external review and monitoring of our practices.
 
In addition, our facilities and operations are subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various environmental and occupational safety and health laws. We believe we are in compliance with all such laws and regulations, and to date, those regulations have not materially restricted or impeded operations. Further, we believe our processes to be highly efficient, generating very low levels of waste and emissions. For this reason, we do not view issues surrounding climate change and any currently foreseeable related regulations as materially impacting our business and financial statements, beyond any inestimable impact on the macro-economic environment. 
 
We have taken a responsible, proactive approach to EH&S by implementing appropriate procedures and processes to have our facilities registered under ISO 14001, American National Standard, Environmental Management System Requirements. We are also involved with leading industry groups that are defining nanomaterial standards and protocols. These currently include the ASTM International Committee on Nanotechnology, and the US TAG to ISO TC 229 Nanotechnology committee managed by the American National Standards Institute committee (ANSI). We also participate in FDA reviews relative to cosmetic and applicable drug applications. We have a full-time, advanced degreed professional, along with a supporting staff, who spend a significant amount of time managing governmental regulation compliance and EH&S. We believe that our Company has an exemplary safety record.

Employees
 
On December 31, 2022, we had a total of 82 full-time employees, 11 of whom hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have a number of temporary, and temporary-to-permanent employees, typically 85 to 100 on a demand-driven basis, and a number of contractors with specific industry experience that have become a part of our talent pool. We have no collective bargaining agreements and believe that we have a strong relationship with our employees, whom management believes represent the strength of our Company.
Backlog
 
We do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. Our sales are primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of our Solésence formulated products, personal care ingredients, and advanced materials. We have some agreements that give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of ingredients during a specified time period. These agreements, however, do not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity of such ingredients. The quantities actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. For these reasons we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts.
Business Segment and Geographical Information
 
Our operations comprise a single business segment and all of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. See Note 13 to the accompanying Financial Statements for additional information.
Key Customers
 
A limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of our commercial revenue, and aside from our largest customer, and our medical diagnostics customer, we are seeing the composition of these key customers change with the growth we are experiencing within our Solésence beauty science subsidiary, which has grown to exceed Personal Care Ingredients and Advanced Materials combined.  For 2022, total Solésence revenue amounted to $23.1M or 62% of total revenue compared to $18.2M, or 62% for 2021.  In particular, revenue from four customers across all business areas, our largest customer in personal care applications (BASF), three of our Solésence customers, constituted approximately 30%, 17%, 15%, and 7%, respectively, of our 2022 total revenue.
 
As our Solésence products continue to represent more of our total revenues, we expect to see a number of smaller (sub-10% of revenue) customers represent a more significant portion of our total revenue. We have experienced this in 2022 and 2021 and expect it to continue in 2023 and beyond. Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and, therefore, may be able to exert a high degree of influence over us. While our agreements with BASF are long-term agreements, they may be terminated by BASF under certain circumstances with reasonable notice and do not provide any guarantees that BASF will buy our products. The loss of one of our largest customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To reduce the impact of having a high concentration of sales to a limited number of customers, we have aggressively pursued new customers through our market focused business model, and particularly through our Solésence beauty science subsidiary. To the extent we are successful in both adding a large number of customers through this model, and maintaining or expanding our existing partners, we believe we will be able to best manage the risks associated with customer concentration.
