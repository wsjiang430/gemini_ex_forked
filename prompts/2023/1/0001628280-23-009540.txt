ITEM 1.    Business
Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (“D&B Entertainment”) is the owner and operator of 204 venues in North America that offer premier entertainment and dining experiences to its guests. The Company has 151 Dave & Buster’s branded stores in 41 states, Puerto Rico, and Canada and offers guests the opportunity to "Eat Drink Play and Watch," all in one location. Each store offers a full menu of entrées and appetizers, a complete selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports and other televised events. On June 29, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Main Event, which as of January 29, 2023, operated 50 Main Event and 3 The Summit branded stores (collectively referred to as "Main Event") in 17 states across the country. Main Event offers food, drinks and amusements, including state-of-the-art bowling, laser tag, hundreds of arcade games and virtual reality, making it the perfect place for families to connect and make memories. 
Unless otherwise provided in this report, references to “Dave & Buster’s,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to D&B Entertainment and its wholly owned subsidiaries and any predecessor entities. 
Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53-week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 each contained 52 weeks. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 29, 2023, January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021 as "fiscal 2022", "fiscal 2021", and "fiscal 2020", respectively, throughout this report. 
Food and Beverage
We strive to differentiate our food with quality, flavorful offerings guided by an “Inspired American Kitchen” identity at our Dave & Buster’s locations and a "Family Kitchen" at our Main Event locations. These offerings are rooted in enhanced flavors and quality ingredients across a condensed number of menu items that enables our customers to explore new flavors while offering a balanced selection of familiar dishes. Our menus simplify execution and, along with recent kitchen enhancements, allow us to deliver dishes to customers hotter and faster to drive an improved customer experience. While our menus appeal to a broad spectrum of customers, we continue to evolve it to reflect the changing tastes of our customers, with options for full meals as well as grabbing an appetizer to share with friends. We deliver high-quality offerings, including a wide variety of starters, one-of-a-kind burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, pasta, and low calorie, vegetarian, and gluten friendly options. We believe our broad menus offer something for everyone and are appropriate for many different occasions. To ensure that we stay on-trend, we update our menus regularly with new food items or limited time offers. Our food revenues, which include non-alcoholic beverages, accounted for approximately 68% of our food and beverage revenues and approximately 23% of our total revenues during fiscal 2022. 
Each of our locations also offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, hand-crafted cocktails, and premium spirits. We are focused on maintaining a streamlined beverage menu for ease of execution, while using quality ingredients including fresh juices, purees and house-made mixers. Beverage service is typically available throughout the entire store, 
allowing for multiple point of sale opportunities. We believe that our high margin beverage offering is complementary to the other offerings at each of our stores. Our alcoholic beverage revenues accounted for approximately 32% of our total food and beverage revenues and approximately 11% of our total revenues during fiscal 2022. 
Amusement and Entertainment
Game play is a key aspect of the entertainment experience at each of our stores, which we believe is the core differentiating feature of our brands. The Midway in each of our stores is an area where we offer a wide array of amusement and entertainment options, some of which are exclusive to our Dave & Buster's and Main Event brands on a permanent or temporary basis. Each of our Dave & Buster’s stores typically has approximately 145 redemption and simulation games as well as our proprietary virtual reality platform. Our Main Event locations feature redemption and simulation games as well as bowling, laser tag, billiards and gravity ropes. Some of our Main Event locations also feature mini escape rooms, mini golf and gravity ropes. Most of our games are activated by game play credits on cards or other RFID devices. A customer purchases a card with game play credits or “chips” at an automated kiosk, through our mobile application, or from one of our team members. Our amusement and other revenues accounted for approximately 65% of our total revenues during fiscal 2022. Redemption games offer our customers the opportunity to win tickets that are redeemable at a retail-style space in our stores with prizes ranging from branded novelty items to high-end electronics. We believe this “opportunity to win” creates a fun and highly energized social experience that is an important aspect of the in-store experience and cannot be easily replicated at home. Many of our non-redemption games, which include our virtual reality, video, and simulation offerings, can be played by multiple customers simultaneously and include some of the latest high-tech games that are commercially available. Other amusements, including billiards and bowling, represented the remainder of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2022. 
Sports-viewing is another key component of the entertainment experience at Dave & Buster’s. All our stores have multiple large screen televisions and high-quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports and other immersive programming. Most of our Dave & Buster's stores have an enhanced viewing experience with huge cutting-edge LED “Wow Walls”, that differentiates Dave & Buster’s by delivering an elevated viewing experience and providing a platform for broader programming and marketing opportunities. Our "Sports Watching" areas offer an immersive viewing environment that provides customers with large, high-definition televisions, to watch community-focused sports programming and enjoy our full bar and food menu. We believe that we have created an energetic environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers, and our goal is to build awareness of D&B as “the best place to watch sports” and the “only place to watch the games and play the games.” 
Competitive Positioning 
The out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers’ discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, night clubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. We also face competition from local, regional, and national establishments that offer similar entertainment experiences and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition on a national basis in the future from other similar concepts. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. 
The key elements that drive our total customer experience and help position us from a competitive standpoint include the following: 
Strong, distinctive brands with broad customer appeal. 
We believe that the multi-faceted customer experience at our stores, supported by our extensive marketing reach has helped us create a widely recognized brand. We have a high degree of awareness of our brands as a dining and entertainment venue, and a broad customer appeal with an attractive target demographic. The primary target for our Dave & Buster’s locations is adults 21-39, while our Main Event branded stores primarily focus on families with children.
Multi-faceted customer experience highlights our value proposition. 
We believe that our combination of interactive games, attractive television viewing areas, high-quality dining, and full-service beverage offerings, delivered in a highly energized atmosphere, provides a multi-faceted customer experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. We aim to offer our customers a value proposition comparable or superior to many of the separately available dining and entertainment options. We are continuously working with game manufacturers and others to create new games and attractions that include content 
that is exclusively available at our Dave & Buster’s and Main Event stores on a permanent or temporary basis. Our new games in combination with new food and beverage offerings and focused attention to the customer experience help us to retain and generate customer traffic. Our value proposition is enhanced by marketing initiatives, including free game play that often features the introduction of our new games, game play dollar volume discounts, and eat and play promotional offers. We believe these initiatives encourage customers to participate more fully across our broad range of food, beverage, and entertainment offerings. 
Store models generate favorable store economics and strong returns. 
We believe our store models offering entertainment, food, and beverages options provide certain benefits in comparison to traditional restaurant concepts, which are reflected in our historically higher revenue per store, higher comparable store operating income margins, and higher comparable Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins (defined in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). 
Our entertainment offerings have low variable costs, generating a gross margin of 91.0% for fiscal 2022. With 65.5% of our fiscal 2022 revenues from entertainment, we have less exposure than traditional restaurant concepts to food costs. Our business model generates strong cash flow that we can use to execute our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our operating income margins, our Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins, our refined new store formats and the fact that our stores typically open with high volumes that drive margins in year one will help us achieve one-year and five-year cash-on-cash return targets. We expect our average one-year and five-year cash-on-cash returns to be approximately 35% and 25%, respectively. We define and calculate cash-on-cash returns for an individual store as (a) Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, excluding pre-opening expenses, national marketing expense allocation, non-cash charges related to asset disposals, currency transactions and changes in non-cash deferred amusement revenue, divided by (b) our net development costs. Net development costs include equipment, building, leaseholds and site costs, net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord payments, excluding pre-opening costs and capitalized interest. 
Commitment to customer satisfaction.
We aim to enhance our food, beverage, and entertainment offerings through our service philosophy of providing a high quality and consistent customer experience through dedicated training and development of our team members and a corporate culture that encourages employee engagement. 
Strategy
Our current strategy is built on the following key components: 
Drive growth in comparable store sales. 
We intend to differentiate our brands from other food and entertainment alternatives and drive growth in our comparable sales, in a competitive landscape, through the following strategies: 
•Offer novel food & drink to bring people together. Our current menu offerings are designed to provide a differentiated food and beverage offering based on an “Inspired American Kitchen” identity at our Dave & Buster's locations and a "Family Kitchen" at our Main Event locations. We aim to offer a wide variety of items for our guests. We also strive to improve efficiency by simplifying execution, allowing us to deliver dishes hotter and faster to drive an improved customer experience. We continually update our offerings based on customer research, and optimize our selections to improve execution efficiency. For both food and beverage, we aim to periodically introduce new items, and run limited time offers during key periods. 
•Offer the latest entertainment to enjoy together. We believe that our games and amusement activities are the core differentiating feature of our brands and staying current with the latest offerings promotes trial and provides an exciting environment to enjoy with friends and family, especially with the latest multiplayer games and challenges. We plan to continually update our games each year through development of innovative and proprietary games and the purchase of new games that will resonate with our customers and drive brand relevance due to a variety of factors, including their large scale, eye-catching appearance, virtual reality features, association with recognizable brands or the fact that they cannot be easily replicated at home. We also intend to extend our programming capabilities at Dave & Buster's stores by offering more curated content and creating a calendar of ongoing and one-time events leveraging our investments in the best and latest audio-visual technology. 
•Align team and integrated experience. We intend to consistently drive service excellence, including the use of technology to improve speed of service and to give our customers more control over their in-store experience. We 
will also refresh our commitment to serving customers through an improved hiring, training and service model, and our team will help create fun and bring our new strategies to life. 
•Drive customer engagement. We will focus on delivering personalized messaging that connects with the customer to drive incremental visitation and will focus our advertising on communicating the emotional side of our brand promise. In addition, we will continue to leverage our customer relationship management program and our growing loyalty database by delivering more targeted individualized offers and creative content. 
Invest domestically in our brands.
We believe that the Dave & Buster’s and Main Event brands have significant domestic growth opportunities in the United States and Canada. In fiscal 2022, we opened seven new Dave & Buster's stores and opened one Main Event store since the Main Event Acquisition was completed. In fiscal 2023 and beyond, the number of openings will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, generate sufficient operating cash flows or utilize available cash to finance construction of leasehold improvements and pre-opening costs, obtain necessary local governmental permits, and recruit and train team members. 
Regarding our long-term strategy of new store growth, we base new site selection on an analytical evaluation of a set of drivers we believe increase the probability of successful, high-volume stores, including site visibility, accessibility and traffic volume, and trade area demographics The experience and relationships of our current development team has enabled us to focus our attention on the most relevant network of real estate brokers, which has given us access to a larger pool of qualified potential store sites. In addition, we believe the more contemporary look of our stores has been one of the key drivers in attracting new developers and building our new store pipeline. 
Dave & Buster's Stores - Our Dave & Buster's stores vary in size from approximately 16,000 to 70,000 square feet. To optimize sales per square foot and further enhance our store economics we currently utilize three basic formats when designing new stores. The target size of our future large format stores is expected to be between 30,000 and 45,000 square feet, the target size of our future medium format stores is expected to be between 25,000 and 30,000 square feet while our small format stores are below 25,000 square feet. We believe that the smaller store format allows us to reduce capital investment risk per store. For the smaller format, we have reduced the back-of-house space and optimized the customer facing area dedicated to video and redemption games. We believe that the smaller format maintains the dynamic customer experience that is the foundation of our brand and allows us flexibility in our site selection process. 
Main Event Stores - Our Main Event stores vary in size from approximately 37,500 to 78,000 square feet. The target size of our future stores is between approximately 40,000 and 55,000 square feet. If an existing building is identified in a target location, we could open a future store outside of this range depending on projected store economics, competition and various other factors.
Invest in Foreign Operations
We own and operate two stores outside of the United States in the Canadian province of Ontario. These stores generated revenues of approximately $21.4 million, $6.9 million, and $2.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2021, our Canadian stores were only able to operate a combined 48 weeks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Canadian stores were open throughout fiscal 2022. At January 30, 2022, less than 2.0% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States. 
The foreign activities of these and future stores outside the United States are subject to various risks of doing business in a foreign country, including currency fluctuations, changes in laws and regulations and economic and political stability. We do not believe there is any material risk associated with the Canadian operations or any dependence by the domestic business upon the Canadian operations. 
We also plan to expand our Dave & Buster's brand through international franchise agreements. In September 2022, we signed an international franchise partnership to begin expanding the Dave & Buster's brand to locations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, followed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Also, the acquisition of Main Event provides the Company with another brand to expand internationally.
To drive international expansion, we have developed key strategic initiatives that uniquely support global market penetration, including a customizable footprint to drive box economics in each market, menu localization with high regional resonance, a proprietary, dynamic pricing model, global marketing programs that are demographically agnostic and locally executable, differentiated and unique amusement strategy and packages, and localized entertainment and 3rd party programming.
Human Capital Management
Our team members are the heart of our Company, and they help us run the fun in our stores every day. We depend on our team members to provide great service and maintain consistently strong operations. Our ability to attract and retain an engaged and experienced team is critical to successful execution of our business strategies. While we continue to operate in a competitive labor environment, we believe our culture, policies, and labor practices contribute to strong relations with our team members. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified store management and operating personnel while also controlling our labor costs.”) 
Our Culture
In our stores and at our store support center, we are committed to being fun creators. Our team members share a deep commitment to values that describe the relationships our team members have with our customers and each other. We are devoted to our service philosophy that calls us to provide exceptional service to our customers and to each other every day. Our attitude encourages intensity, hard work, and having fun. We firmly believe we are better together and we encourage inclusivity, teamwork, and good judgment. Finally, we encourage all team members to be committed to innovation, embracing change, and continuous learning and growth. 
Our Team
At January 29, 2023, we employed 22,748 team members across both of our brands, consisting of 342 store support, 164 dedicated special events sales force, 1,583 store management, and 20,659 store hourly team members. 
Our values bind us to a shared commitment to attract, retain, engage, and develop a team that mirrors the diversity of the customers we serve. We strive to provide inclusive fun for all, and we believe our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion promotes teamwork to achieve our common goals, helps our team members reach their highest potential at work, enables our team members to make better decisions to serve all our stakeholders, and fuels innovation. Racial minorities make up approximately 65% of our U.S. workforce, and we are proud of our diversity, which is summarized below: 

 | Male | | Female | | Total
White | 16.8 | % | | 18.6 | % | 35.4 | %
Hispanic | 14.5 | % | | 16.2 | % | 30.7 | %
Black or African American | 12.8 | % | | 14.1 | % | 26.9 | %
Asian/American Indian/Pacific Islander | 1.7 | % | | 2.2 | % | 3.9 | %
Two or more races | 1.4 | % | | 1.7 | % | 3.1 | %
Total | 47.2 | % | | 52.8 | % | 100.0 | %

In fiscal 2022, we strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Among other key accomplishments, we:
•progressed on our goals to improve representation of women and team members who are black, indigenous or people of color (BIPOC) in our corporate and field leadership before the end of FY 2025;
•enhanced our commitment to women in leadership through greater participation in membership and activity with Women’s Foodservice Forum; 
•emphasized our commitment to diversity and belonging throughout the year in internal and external communications, including social media and the expansion of our Diversity Council membership and activity.
We believe our culture, policies, and labor practices contribute to strong engagement with our team members. In particular, our leaders work to develop and maintain strong communications and relationships with our team members. 
Our Leadership Team
We are led by a strong senior management team with a wealth of experience with national brands spanning casual dining, entertainment, and other consumer-centric industries. We believe that our management team’s prior experience, combined with its experience at Dave & Buster’s and Main Event, provides us with insights into our customer base and enables us to create the dynamic environment that is core to our brands. 
Our Store Teams 
Our typical store team consists of a General Manager supported by an average of six to seven additional management positions per store. Management team members handle various departments within the store including 
responsibility for hourly team members. A typical Dave & Buster’s store employs approximately 115 hourly team members, and a typical Main Event store employs approximately 95 team members, most of which who part-time.
The General Manager and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including the hiring, training, and development of team members, as well as financial and operational performance. There is a defined structure of development and progression of job responsibilities within the supporting management positions to ensure that an adequate succession plan exists within each store. Each store is overseen by a Regional Operations Director, Senior Regional Operations Director or Vice President of Operations (collectively, “Regional Management”) who directly or indirectly report to our Chief Operating Officer. We are proud of our store leadership teams’ experience and carefully monitor store management team retention rates, which for us has consistently tracked in the top quartile of the upscale casual dining industry. 
Attracting Talent
We seek to hire experienced leaders and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. We offer performance-based compensation programs to our store management and store support center employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level) include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, and various employee assistance programs. In addition, our salaried and hourly team members are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure. 
Developing Talent
We motivate and develop our team members by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. Throughout the year, we provide numerous training opportunities for our team members, with a focus on continuous learning and development. With hundreds of leadership positions across our stores, we provide a pathway and training for individuals across the organization to advance from entry-level jobs into management roles. In addition, our geographic footprint often allows us to offer our store team members relocation options. 
We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, safety protocols, game playability and maintenance of our stores. We provide new team members with comprehensive orientation and one-on-one training for their positions to help ensure they meet our high standards. New team members are trained by partnering with a trainer to assure that the training and information they receive is complete and accurate. Team members are certified for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness and responsibility training for service team members. 
We require our new store managers to complete an eight-week training program that includes front-of-house service, kitchen, amusements, and management responsibilities. Newly trained managers are then assigned to their home store, where they receive additional training with their General Manager. Their last two weeks of training include a comprehensive validation of new skills. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We conduct regular evaluations with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals and continuously evaluate our staffing to proactively plan for growth. We hold an annual General Manager conference in which our General Managers share best practices and receive an operating plan they will execute to drive performance. 
When we open a new store, we provide varying levels of training to team members in each position to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the store from the first day it opens to the public. Prior to opening a new store, our dedicated training and opening team travels to the store to deliver an intensive training program for all team members. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important because it helps us provide our customers with a quality experience from day one. After a store has been opened and is operating smoothly, the store managers supervise the training of new team members. 
Corporate Responsibility
Our core values call for each of our team members to care for each other, our customers, and the communities we serve. We will not do business with organizations that employ or condone unfair labor practices. We partner with suppliers who share our commitment to ethical business conduct, fair labor practices, proven environmental, health, and safety practices, and environmental sustainability. We also specifically condemn human trafficking and abuse of child labor. We understand that supporting our communities includes being good environmental stewards and striving to conduct business in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. 
In addition, we strongly encourage team members to give back to the communities we serve. Although our Company invests time and resources in many charitable causes, we have two main causes we focus our efforts to support. The first is our long-standing partnership with Make-A-Wish, which we have proudly supported in a national partnership since April 2012. Through fiscal 2022, we have given over $17 million to this worthy cause, and we participate in several events throughout the year both in our stores and at our store support center to raise money for Make-A-Wish. We also volunteer our time and talents. 
In addition, we invest in helping our own team members during their times of greatest need. The D&B H.E.A.R.T. (Helping Employees at Rough Times) Fund was an independent non-profit established to create an employee assistance fund for the benefit of team members who suffer catastrophic events resulting in severe economic hardship. The Main Event Family Fund was also an independent non-profit established employee assistance fund for the benefit of Main Event team members. In February 2023, we combined the two funds into a new independent non-profit employee assistance fund named Buster's Legacy Fund. Both funds and the new Buster's Legacy Fund are financed by contributions from our team members, customers, and business partners. 
Advertising and Marketing
We use advertising and marketing to build awareness and strengthen our brands' relevance. We spent approximately $57.6 million in marketing efforts in fiscal 2022, $32.2 million in fiscal 2021, and $21.1 million in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, due to the temporary closures, capacity restrictions and other operating limitations imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we substantially curtailed national cable television media, which continues to be the largest portion of our advertising and marketing spend. 
We utilize several forms of media, including investments in linear TV, connected TV, social and digital video, and test new types of programmatic display and digital audio, and have several digital marketing initiatives including search engine marketing and optimization, mobile campaigns, and website improvements. We execute periodic promotions, create in-store point-of-purchase materials and execute local marketing plans to address specific objectives in individual stores or markets. We work with external advertising, digital, media and design agencies in the development and execution of these programs. 
We also invest in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our customers and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society. Central to this effort is continued investment in our mobile application and web platforms, which are used to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing periodic exclusive offers and discounts and providing a convenient way to purchase gaming cards. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we launched an enhanced loyalty program for our Dave & Buster's brand that now has millions of members and continues to grow. The Dave & Buster’s Rewards Program is a customer recognition program that rewards members primarily for their game chips played. Eligible members have the ability to level-up by playing game chips, and members are rewarded with free game play or food offers based on their level. As our loyalty program continues to grow, it provides an important method for maintaining customers’ connection with the D&B brand and further driving customer satisfaction. 
We utilize a number of other initiatives to continually improve our market effectiveness, including refining our marketing strategy to better reach both young adults and families, creating new advertising campaigns, investing in menu research and development to differentiate our food offerings from our competition and improve key product attributes (quality, consistency, value and overall customer satisfaction) and execution, developing product/promotional strategies to attract new customers and increase spending/length of stay, and reflecting a consistent brand identity that represents our positioning and commitment to quality. 
Special Event marketing programs are run in support of our special events team initiatives. Dedicated, target-specific marketing programs are executed primarily utilizing digital, customer relationship management (CRM), and print marketing collateral. We have online booking for social parties to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers. 
Information Technology and Cyber Security 
We utilize several proprietary and third-party management information systems. These systems are designed to enable our games’ functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense. We believe our management information systems are sufficient to support our business plans. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria. 
Our managers have daily routines focused on driving consistent execution in food, beverage, and amusements. We utilize a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. In addition to our own routines, we leverage a third-party vendor to help ensure quality beverage operations, responsible alcohol service and loss prevention. Our workforce management platform also allows management to quickly add or reduce labor based on real-time business needs and historically assisted our managers in optimizing hourly labor based on anticipated sales volumes. Our amusement team uses a proprietary system that is supported by a mobile application that identifies amusement issues and needed repairs to help ensure our games are operational and meeting our ideal playing standard. Complementing this program is our routine preventative maintenance program, designed to prevent game failure and extend the functionality of our games. Consolidated reporting tools for the key drivers of our business are provided to our Regional Management to identify and troubleshoot any systemic issues.
We have invested in connectivity and data infrastructure to modernize and upgrade the capacity of our store systems, continued work on new, customer-facing digital experiences, such as the launch of our new mobile application that supports in-store and off-premise amusement entertainment, and deployed hand-held point-of-sale devices in our stores. 
We accept electronic payment cards from our customers for payment in our stores. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and team members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our customers’ credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our employees’ personal information. Our existing cyber security policy includes cyber security techniques, tactics, and procedures, including continuous monitoring and detection programs, network protections, employee training and awareness and incident response preparedness. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerability, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. We utilize a voluntary tool to help manage privacy risk by independently benchmarking our cyber security program to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cybersecurity Framework, using an independent third party, and we share the results of our annual audit with our Audit Committee. 
In fiscal 2022, we began investing in new enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), human capital management ("HCM"), and inventory software to provide our store management and store support teams with the tools necessary to enhance our ability to record and track data, make more effective real-time decisions, and drive process efficiencies. We plan to implement these new systems over the next two years.
Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing
We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process. Within each store, the Kitchen Manager is primarily responsible for ensuring the timely and correct preparation of food products per the recipes we specify. We provide each of our stores with various tools and training to facilitate these activities.
Store-Level Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality
Our revenues are influenced by seasonal shifts in consumer spending. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays, which will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters. During the first half of fiscal 2021, results also fluctuated due to the timing and frequency of temporary closures and operating restrictions as a result of state and local guidelines imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Suppliers
The principal goods used by us are redemption game prizes and food and beverage products, which are available from a number of suppliers. We currently purchase a significant amount of our amusement merchandise through a direct import program, a program in which we purchase amusement redemption merchandise and certain furniture directly from offshore manufacturers. We are a large buyer of traditional and amusement games and as a result believe we receive discounted pricing arrangements. Wage inflation and other macro-economic pressures could result in increasing expenses, as suppliers may seek to pass higher costs on to us. 
Intellectual Property
We have registered the trademarks Dave & Buster’s®, Power Card®, Eat & Play Combo®, Eat Drink Play®, Eat Drink Play Watch®, Main Event®, Main Event Entertainment®, and Eat.Bowl.Play® and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our tradenames and our logos to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to sign a code of ethics, which includes an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential. 
Government Regulation
