Item 1. Business
General
 
We are an early-stage blank check company incorporated in August 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company whose business purpose is to effect an initial business combination. Since our initial public offering, we have focused our search for an initial business combination with businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns.
Initial Public Offering
 
On November 16, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 10,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share and one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $115,000,000, which included an additional 1,500,000 units and 52,500 placement units in connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, generating an additional $525,000 of gross proceeds. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 528,075 units to our sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $5,280,750.

The Share Purchase Agreement
 
This section describes the material provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following summary of the Share Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Share Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1.

General Description of the Share Purchase Agreement
 
On August 1, 2022, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with Graphjet Technology Sdn.

The Share Purchase Agreement is by and among the Company, Graphjet, Swee Guan Hoo, solely in his capacity as the representative of the shareholders of the Company, and their successors and assignees (the “Purchaser Representative”), from and after the closing of the Graphjet Business Combination (the “Closing”), and the holders of all issued and outstanding shares of Graphjet (the “Graphjet Shares”) (each, a “Selling Shareholder” and collectively, the “Selling Shareholders”), and Lee Ping Wei, in the capacity as the representative for the Selling Shareholders (the “Shareholder Representative”).
 
Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement (the “Transactions”), (i) each Selling Shareholder shall sell to the Company, and the Company shall purchase from each Selling Shareholder, all of the issued and outstanding Graphjet Shares, as set forth opposite the name of such Selling Shareholder on Exhibit A-1 of the Share Purchase Agreement, free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances, in exchange for the right to receive such Selling Shareholder’s share of the Transaction Consideration (as defined below); (ii) Graphjet shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and (iii) the Company will change its name to Graphjet Technology.

Representations and Warranties; Covenants
 
The Share Purchase Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties by each of the Company, Graphjet and the Selling Shareholders as of the date of the Share Purchase Agreement and as of the date of the Closing. Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect” as used in the Share Purchase Agreement means with respect to any specified person or entity, any fact, event, occurrence, change or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of such person or entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of such person or entity or any of its subsidiaries on a timely basis to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement or the ancillary documents to which it is a party or bound or to perform its obligations thereunder, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Share Purchase Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the Share Purchase Agreement. The representations and warranties made by the Company, Graphjet and the Selling Shareholders are customary for transactions similar to the Transactions.
 
Each party agreed in the Share Purchase Agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing and obtain third party and regulatory approvals. The Share Purchase Agreement also contains certain customary covenants by the Company and Graphjet during the period between the signing of the Share Purchase Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms (the “Interim Period”), regarding (1) the provision of access to their properties, books and personnel; (2) the operation of their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business; (3) provision of financial statements by Graphjet; (4) Energem’s public filings; (5) no insider trading; (6) notifications of certain breaches, consent requirements or other matters; (7) efforts to file the S-4 Registration Statement (as defined below); (8) tax matters; (9) further assurances; (10) election of the post-Closing board of directors; (11) public announcements; and (12) confidentiality.

There are also certain customary post-Closing covenants regarding (1) tax matters; (2) maintenance of books and records; (3) indemnification of directors and officers; and (4) use of trust account proceeds.
 
The Share Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby require the approval of the Company’s shareholders. The Company agreed, as promptly as practicable after the effective date of the Share Purchase Agreement, to prepare, with reasonable assistance from Graphjet, and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended, the “S-4 Registration Statement”) in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) of the Energem Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the Selling Shareholders as Transaction Consideration, and containing a proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of soliciting proxies from the shareholders of the Company. The solicitation of proxies is required to obtain the Company’s shareholders approval of the Share Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the “Energem Shareholder Approval Matters”), at a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders (the “Energem Special Meeting”) and providing such shareholders an opportunity to participate in the Redemption. The Company initially filed the S-4 Registration Statement with the SEC on December 7, 2022.

Our Business
 
We have specifically formed a preeminent management team and board of directors with significant experience to source, evaluate and execute a merger with a company that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team. We believe that the principal technologies and sectors with massive potential include: zero emission technologies in the in the renewable energy space. Applications will only be limited by imagination. From a geographic standpoint, our target sectors are globally integrated, and we target to capture opportunities high growth markets such as North America and Asia Pacific.
 
Our team is composed of seasoned industry leaders and experienced capital investors, and it has a robust network in our target industries and significant experience in the sourcing, due diligence, acquisition and execution of strategic investments. Further, our team has a global, demonstrated track-record of executing investments and managing follow-on growth in our target industries, with transaction sizes ranging from the hundreds of millions to multiple billions.
 
We intend to partner with the management and owners of one or more high-quality companies seeking an alternative to a traditional initial public offering (“IPO”). We will use our management team’s significant venture capital and private equity experience in sourcing transactions and due diligence to identify and negotiate a combination with an enduring business. The traditional IPO process entails significant preparation, commitment of time and resources and entails meaningful uncertainty. As a result, management and owners are searching for viable public market alternatives. We believe that the combined experience of our management, members of our Board and our advisors, represents a compelling alternative combined with the potential for long-term value creation.
 
We see an increased focus on sustainability and impact during the countdown to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) by 2030. This focus is driving numerous attractive and high-growth commercial opportunities that can contribute to the solution of complex global challenges such as zero emissions, industrial innovation, reduction of waste, and combating climate change. Indeed, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) investing continues to grow in significance with both institutional and retail investors, and its alignment with consumer behavior continues to grow as well.
 
We have also observed that companies increasingly seek to become more mission-driven through the adoption of clear and transparent ESG frameworks. Further, we are seeing that an emphasis on better outcomes for all stakeholders is increasingly becoming a source of competitive advantage. It is already well-evidenced that businesses with strong ESG practices can achieve attractive investment returns. In an era where more and more people want to work for, buy from and invest in organizations that share their values, we believe companies that have a positive impact on society and the planet will be better placed to succeed and grow sustainably.
 
Our team is comprised of seasoned industry leaders and experienced capital investors, and it has a robust network in our target industries and significant experience in the sourcing, due diligence, acquisition and execution of strategic investments. Further, our team has a global, demonstrated track record of executing investments and managing follow-on growth in our target industries, with transaction sizes ranging from the hundreds of millions to multiple billions.
 
Over the course of their careers, our management team and Board have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of opportunities. This network has been developed through both investing and operating experience across a broad range of sectors, including diversified business services, technology, telecommunications, media and entertainment, pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare, financial services and financial technology, consumer products, energy and power, real estate including real estate services and related businesses, environmental services, mobility and electrification of the transportation industry and insurance and insurance related services. We expect these networks will provide us with a robust flow of opportunities for a potential business combination.
 
We have employed a pro-active acquisition strategy focused on identifying potential business combination targets, as seen with the Graphjet Business Combination. We believe strongly in our management team’s ability to add value from both an operating and a financing perspective which has been a key driver of past performance and we believe will continue to be central to its differentiated acquisition strategy.

Our Business Strategy
 
Our investment strategy seeks to promote responsible and purposeful business standards, and focuses on the following three types of companies:
 

● | Businesses that contribute scalable solutions in the renewable energy space, which have positive fundamental growth drivers that deliver attractive financial returns and measurable impact when considering ESG factors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Best-in-class businesses that benefit all stakeholders, where we can leverage our impact management expertise to maximize the companies’ positive impacts, build a stronger brand and value proposition, and drive financial return; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses which do not currently have best-in-class impact management practices but where there is an opportunity to re-orient and transform currently negative aspects of business operations to generate positive outcomes; and in doing so, build a more sustainable and resilient business model with a more attractive, less risky and more future-proofed financial return. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we believe our management and sponsors’ experience allows us to evaluate targets that have the potential to accelerate financial value creation while also having a measurable net positive impact on the environment and society outside of China and Hong Kong.
 
Our management team’s efforts to seek a suitable business combination target will be complemented by the experience and network of our Board of Directors. In addition, our management team and Board of Directors will utilize their extensive networks of seasoned industry operators and advisors to help us identify potential targets and effect the initial business combination in a more efficient process. We believe that our team and vision will make us an attractive partner for founders and owners in the industries in which we plan to pursue business combination targets.
 
Globally, we are approaching a decisive moment for international efforts to tackle the climate crisis – a great challenge of our times. The number of countries that have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century or soon after continues to grow, but so do global greenhouse gas emissions. This gap between rhetoric and action needs to close if we are to have a fighting chance of reaching net zero by 2050 and limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C. Doing so requires nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems that underpin our economies. We are in a critical year at the start of a critical decade for these efforts.
 
Our business strategies will be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in the energy value chain with an immediate plan to focus on South East Asia and the Asia Pacific Regions (outside of China and Hong Kong), specifically in the oil and gas and other potential renewable energy business as well as other adjacent services, industrials, and technologies, and remaining opportunities across the energy value chain, including select opportunities within the traditional power generation and energy production.
 
We believe that the way businesses and consumers operate, make decisions, and spend has forever been changed because of the pandemic. We believe further that our relationships with a large pool of quality initial business combination targets looking for an opportunity to create liquidity for current investors and currency to acquire other companies. This provides numerous opportunities, and we would be well positioned given the difficulty in bridging technology and/or capital opportunities between the east and west. Further, we believe that the management team and board member’s extensive background, careers, reputations, and relationships in cross border business experience gives us the insight and position to identify the ideal targets for a business combination that creates long-term opportunity and value growth and to complete the business combination.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets, such as Graphjet, for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe:

● | are fundamentally sound but that we believe can improve results by leveraging the transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience of our management team; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


12
--


● | have high-quality and strategically located assets; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | have a de-risked asset base with meaningful free cash flow; 
● | can utilize the extensive networks and insights that our management team and have built in the energy value chain; 
● | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance; 
● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; 
● | have an attractive valuation at entry and conservative balance sheet to create resiliency across the commodity cycle; 
● | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. 
● | synergistic /strategic partnership with existing owner; 
● | clean slate with no or minimum legacy issues; 
● | offer growth potential & knock-on opportunities; and 
● | strong focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) and sustainability. 

 
Potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks. We intend to spend significant time assessing a company’s leadership and personnel and evaluating what we can do to augment or upgrade the team over time if needed. We will seek to identify business that we believe exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, or that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to determine a target company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review will encompass, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with incumbent management and employees, inspection of facilities, consultations with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers, and suppliers, as well as a review of operational, legal, and additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
We expect to place significant emphasis on a business combination target’s technology and intellectual property as part of our acquisition evaluation process, consistent with the investment approach of our management team. This due diligence may include the engagement of multiple technical experts across both industry and academia to review the technology, participation in joint due diligence meetings with these technical experts and management, as well as detailed intellectual property due diligence, to determine the nature and quality of a company’s technology innovation.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own founder shares and may own rights following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors, as well as our management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
 
Each of our directors and officers presently has and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as Graphjet. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See “The Share Purchase Agreement” above for more information regarding such exchange in the Share Purchase Agreement. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the Graphjet Business Combination, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for an initial business combination presently in the amount of approximately $20,011,014.13 (as of March 23, 2023), we offer a target business, such as Graphjet, a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints.

Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement units, our share capital debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We receive proprietary transaction opportunities as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities from the network built up by our management team and by the members of our Board. Target business candidates, such as Graphjet, have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, if we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering and approving the transaction.
 

15
--


Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the Graphjet management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Graphjet Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, including the Graphjet Business Combination, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs after our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses, or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, such as Graphjet, we have conducted and will continue conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
The Energem Board retained Baker Tilly (Malaysia) to opine on the fairness of the proposed acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in Graphjet for the Transaction Consideration of US$1.38 billion. Baker Tilly concluded that the fair market value of the entire equity interest in Graphjet ranges from USD $2.20 billion to USD $2.65 billion using the Relative Valuation Approach (“RVA”) methodology followed by the application of a fifty percent (50%) Start-Up Discount to Graphjet’s valuation. The Relative Valuation Approach uses a “relative valuation model,” which is a business valuation method that compares a company’s value to that of its competitors or industry peers to assess the company’s financial worth. The Energem Board relied on the Baker Tilly fairness opinion regarding the fairness of the Transaction Consideration to acquire Graphjet.
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.

Type of Transaction | Whether Share Approval is Required
---------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of shares of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or 
● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

 
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote; 


17
--


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | other time and budget constraints of the Company; and 
● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders. 

Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination
 
The shareholders of the Company approved the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association at the November 16, 2022 Extraordinary General Meeting, changing the structure and cost of the Company’s right to extend the Termination Date by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, which we refer to as a “business combination,” (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100% of the Company’s common shares included as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering that closed on November 18, 2021, which was November 18, 2022 but was amended to extend the Termination Date by up to nine (9) one-month extensions to August 18, 2023 provided that (i) the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional $0.045 per share for each month until August 18, 2023, and (ii) compliance with the procedures relating to any such extension, as set forth in the Trust Agreement.
Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. If our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our public shares of Common Shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination, such as the Graphjet Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required period.

18

Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of ordinary shares present and entitled to vote at the meeting to approve the initial business combination are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding ordinary shares of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of ordinary shares of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our sponsor, officers, directors, and director nominees will count towards this quorum. Our sponsor, officers, directors, and director nominees have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our sponsor, officers, directors, and director nominees may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination.
 
Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against, or abstain from voting on, the proposed transaction or abstain from voting. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or abstained from voting. Public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any extension of the period to complete our initial business combination.
 
If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 

19
--


Our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of our Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
 
Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the initial business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 

20
--


The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. To perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the Company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the Company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before delivering his or her shares to the Company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 12 months (or as extended as provided in our registration statement) from the closing of this offering. Public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any extension of the period to complete our initial business combination.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that we have up to nine (9) one-month Extensions to August 18, 2023, provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional $0.045 per share for each month, or as extended by the Company’s shareholders in accordance with our Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. If we are unable to complete our business combination by August 18, 2023 (or as otherwise extended), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by August 18, 2023, in accordance with our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
 
Our sponsor, directors and each member of our management have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination including with respect to any shares obtained through the placement units. However, if our sponsor, directors or members of our management team acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination.

Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the interest on the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering the sale of the placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.15. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.15. Under Section 281(b) of the Companies Act, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our shareholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.

The underwriters will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.15 per unit, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
 
If an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.15 per unit, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, and our sponsor asserts that they are unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.15 per unit.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to the remaining proceeds of this offering and the sale of the placement units with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $25,000).
 
If we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder.
 
Under the Companies Act, shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public shareholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination may be considered a liquidating distribution under Cayman Islands law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Companies Act intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to shareholders, any liability of shareholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such shareholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the shareholder, and any liability of the shareholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public shareholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Cayman Islands law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the Companies Act, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay taxes and if needed, dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our shareholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the Companies Act requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.15 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. If an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.15 per unit to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some, or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, with respect to such shares of our Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as Graphjet, we may continue to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.

We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large-accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or after the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
