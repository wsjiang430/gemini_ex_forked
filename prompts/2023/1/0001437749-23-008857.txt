Item 1.     BusinessCompany Overview
 
TSS, Inc. provides a range of comprehensive services to enable the planning, design, deployment, maintenance, and refurbishment of end-user and enterprise systems, including the mission-critical facilities they are housed in. We provide a single-source solution for enabling technologies in data centers, operation centers, network facilities, server rooms, security operations centers, communications facilities and the infrastructure systems that are critical to their function. Our services include technology consulting, design and engineering, project management, systems integration, system installations, facilities management and IT procurement and reseller services.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in December 2004. Our headquarters and our systems integration facility are located in Round Rock, Texas.
 
Our business is concentrated on the data center infrastructure and services market. This market remains highly competitive as commerce continues to move to cloud-based solutions and as data storage and compute requirements continue to escalate for many industries. These underlying macroeconomic trends are driving demand for more information technology equipment, and more efficient data center design and operations, resulting in continued overall growth in this market. We compete in large growing market segments, often against larger competitors who have greater resources. We rely on several large customers to win contracts and to provide business to us under “Master Service Agreements”, and the loss of any such customers could have a material negative effect on our results.
 
In particular, we are focused on the cloud IT infrastructure market with emphasis on the modular data center area, and we have concentrated our activities around our systems integration and facilities maintenance businesses. We have also developed and expanded our rack integration, imaging and logistic services to increase the overall utilization of our systems integration facility and to insulate us from the variable timing of modular data center orders. This simplification of our business and the focus towards the modular data center market has increased our customer concentration and concentrated the markets in which we compete.
 
Almost all of the components used in our systems integration business are consigned to us by our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or their end-user customers, thus our revenues reflect only the services we perform, and the consigned components are not reflected in our balance sheet. We also offer our customers the ability to procure third-party hardware, software and services on their behalf that are then used in our integration services as we integrate these components to deliver a completed system to our customer. In some cases, we also act as an agent and arrange for the purchase of third-party hardware, software or services that are to be provided to our customers by another party and we have no control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. In these instances, we are acting as an agent in the transaction. These procurement and reseller activities allow us to develop relationships with new hardware, software and professional service providers and allow us to generate higher margins on integration projects by broadening our revenue and customer base.
 

Service Offerings
 
We have developed a unique set of solution offerings where we provide a range of services that enable our customers and partners to more efficiently plan, develop, deploy and maintain data centers and their related assets, along with end user systems. These solutions begin with strategies for the care of information technology assets that are being housed in the facility or modular data centers, including power, cooling and heat rejection, as well as disaster recovery backup systems. Our operating expenses are not exclusively aligned to each service offering, as shared resources such as sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses support all services. Our solutions involve all aspects of the life cycle of both traditional and modular data centers and their related assets and are described in more detail below.

Facilities Services:
 
Consulting: 
 
During the initial phase of a data center project, we provide project development-related services that typically include establishing project goals and a preliminary budget and schedules, setting technical parameters and requirements, and determining project team members and the overall requirements of the team.
 
Design and engineering consulting services typically include critical power and mechanical load calculations, mechanical design and engineering, high and medium voltage electrical design and engineering, communications and security systems design and engineering, physical vulnerability assessments, force protection design and bomb blast analyses, fire protection system design and engineering, facility systems equipment selection and facility commissioning and testing. These offerings also include post commissioning support of on-going operations.
 
Our strategy is intended to increase the amount of recurring revenues we generate from our existing customers, IT equipment partners, and major systems integrators. Our mission critical facilities experience and our personnel skills position us as a trusted advisor to our customers and allow us to work on new opportunities as our customers grow or as their facilities mature and as partners introduce us to new client opportunities.
 
Deployment:
 
In connection with the deployment of a customer’s data center or related equipment requirements, our capabilities include project management, value engineering and design management, bid negotiation support, subcontractor pre-qualification and selection, long-lead equipment procurement, issuance of equipment and construction contracts, and refinement and management of project budgets and schedules. Our project managers mobilize the required expertise for the project, utilizing project superintendents, quality control and safety professionals, as well as qualified subcontractors and support personnel. Project managers supervise work by project team members, including subcontracted parties, including all aspects of the following: architecture and construction, electric power systems, heat rejection and cooling, energy management and controls, cooling tower systems, security systems, voice, data and network cabling, fire and life safety systems, and process piping and plumbing systems. The project manager remains responsible for managing all aspects of the project until project completion and customer delivery.
 
In addition, this installation portion of a project has the largest number of outside influences that can impact project goals and objectives, such as weather, non-performance of subcontractors, equipment deliveries, unexpected project changes from the owner, and influence from local authorities and utility providers. Therefore, management experience, skill and mission focus are critical during the project installation period.
 
Management:
 
We provide a comprehensive maintenance and service offering designed to ensure that the multiple systems critical to sustaining on-line applications in technologically intensive facilities and modular data centers remain operational and functional. Typical facilities management services include overall management of the post-construction facility maintenance program, and on-site staffing of technical engineering positions (e.g., electricians, HVAC mechanics, control technicians and voice/data technicians). Increasingly, data centers are being constructed in a modular format, whereby information technology, power and other related assets are deployed in pre-integrated solutions. Modular data centers may have lower overall cost of delivery, lower energy consumption and shorter deployment schedules compared to traditional data centers. Our on-site maintenance services provide additional project revenue for us and position us for involvement in any new facility planning, design and construction initiatives that the customer undertakes.
 
In addition, we provide 24X7 Network Operations support from our Round Rock, Texas facility that has the capability of remotely monitoring our data center service contract customers’ facilities for systems operations and emergency events that could lead to outages. Temperature levels, humidity, electrical connectivity, power usage and fire alarm conditions are among the items monitored. The system maintains all site documentation for repairs and maintenance performed on each critical piece of equipment covered under our services. The information is useful to our customers in assessing operational efficiency and causes of failure and enables them to make critical decisions on repair or replacement strategies based on the operating history of the monitored systems.

Our facilities maintenance service contracts are typically one to three years in duration with cancellation clauses for nonperformance and are typically billed annually in advance. Our service contracts take different forms including fixed-price equipment maintenance with optional comprehensive warranty to fix failures in key components such as uninterruptible power supplies or batteries, ticket-based service provided at contracted rates in a master service agreement, comprehensive facility services agreements that include on site staffing, scheduled equipment maintenance and nontechnical facility services, and direct job-specific contracts for additional moves, add, refresh, refurbishment and change work within a facility.
 
As computer density increased and data centers evolved into the use of modular form factors, we found that we could leverage our facilities maintenance experience and infrastructure by offering maintenance service of modules being deployed into new data centers. The number of modular units under our service contracts has continued to expand. Our design services continue to evolve to support changing data center requirements including installation and maintenance of systems deployed on the edge. Ultimately, we started working with IT vendors to help them in the design and integration of their IT equipment into modular data centers, which typically leads to ongoing maintenance contracts as these modular systems deploy.
 
Systems Integration Services:
 
To assist our customers with IT-equipment deployment in their data centers we provide what we call “systems integration” services. We provide integrated technology services and software tools designed to accelerate the delivery of complex information technology solutions. These services include custom configuration of a broad scope of information technology products including client products, enterprise products, clusters and modular containers. The integration of this equipment at both a rack-level or modular data center level is performed to our customer specifications and test criteria and may include imaging of software onto the hardware as well. We are generally not responsible for the performance of the related equipment in the field. In addition, we provide warehousing of high value equipment such as servers, switches and other information technology hardware that are generally provided on a consignment basis to us to by our OEM and end-user customers. We also provide second-touch services such as adding software, hardware or other features to end-user devices, bundling of such devices with peripherals, pre-loading of customer-determined application software, tagging, asset capture and other fulfilment services for our OEM and end-user customers.
Procurement and Reseller Services:
 
We generate revenues from fees we charge our customers to procure third-party hardware, software and professional services on their behalf that are then used in our integration services as we integrate these components to deliver a completed system to our customer. These procurement and reseller services enable highly customizable solutions for our OEM and end-user customers and enable us to generate larger revenues and profits while expanding our customer base. We recognize our reseller services revenue upon completion of the procurement activity. In some cases, we arrange for the purchase of third-party hardware, software or professional services that are to be provided directly to our customers by another party and we have no control of the goods before they are transferred to the customer. In these instances, we are acting as an agent in the transaction and recognize revenue as the amount of any fee or commissions that we expect to be entitled to after paying the other party for the goods or services provided to the customer.
Customers
 
Our customers include IT OEM equipment, technology and service companies, and private sector businesses that in some cases are the end users of the facility or in other cases are providing a facility to a government or commercial end user.
 
One customer comprised 96% and 95% of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our marketing approach emphasizes expertise in information technology hardware systems, energy consumption, real estate matters and facilities planning and operation. This marketing approach allows the customer to contract for comprehensive facilities services or to contract separately for each individual project phase. Our marketing program seeks to capitalize on our industry standing, including our existing relationships and our reputation based upon our performance on completed projects. We also seek to enhance our name recognition through the use of trade shows, technical seminars, direct mailings and the media. A key part of our selling strategy is entering into master service agreements with multiple partners and co-selling our range of services to the end-user customers of our partners, leveraging their customer relationships and broadening the scope of potential customers for us.
 
Our headcount in sales and marketing has fluctuated as we have worked to align the skill sets with our evolving service offerings, leverage partner relationships and increase the consultative capability of our sales organization.

Maintaining key alliances is also crucial to sales development and growth and often provides us with introductions to the customers of our alliance partners. These alliances reside with various information technology consulting firms, specialty mission-critical engineering firms, application service providers and internet service providers. Key alliance opportunities also reside in other firms within the market sector such as equipment manufacturers, product suppliers, property management firms, developers, information technology system integrators and firmware providers. We have key strategic alliances with large information technology corporations to provide engineering, design, construction management services, systems integration, modular solutions and facility management services. As we expand our reseller services, we are also establishing alliances with new hardware and software providers who operate in the IT infrastructure market.
 
Competition
 
The mission-critical information technology solutions market is large, fragmented and highly competitive. We compete for contracts based on the strength of our customer relationships, successful past performance record, significant technical expertise, specialized knowledge and broad service offerings. We often compete against divisions of large information technology service and equipment providers of various sizes. Some of these competitors are large, well-established companies that have broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources than us. In some cases, because of diverse requirements, we frequently collaborate with these and other competitors for large projects. We expect competition in the information technology services sector to continue to increase in the future.
 
Because of the breadth of services that we provide, we face many different competitors some of which are our customers or vendors. We believe that, while we face large and small competitors across the spectrum of our service offerings, we are uniquely positioned to provide services to IT and facilities across both modular and traditional data center markets. We believe by providing a single source solution focused in the data center market allows us to meet our customer’s requirements cost effectively.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2022, we had 70 full-time employees. Our future success will depend significantly on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
