Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative diseases and disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, and retina. Currently available therapies for these diseases are limited, with many diseases having no approved therapies or treatments. Our goal is to develop disease modifying treatments for patients with these degenerative disorders by initially leveraging our expertise in the sigma 2 receptor, or S2R, which is expressed by multiple cell types, including neuronal synapses, and acts as a key regulator of cellular damage commonly associated with certain age-related degenerative diseases of the CNS and retina. We believe that targeting the S2R complex represents a mechanism that is functionally distinct from other current approaches in clinical development for the treatment of degenerative diseases.
Our lead product candidate, CT1812, is an orally delivered, small molecule modulator designed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and bind selectively to the S2R complex. We have initially focused on the development of CT1812 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, by targeting β-amyloid, or Aβ, oligomers, which has been linked to the disease. We believe our evidence demonstrates that by binding to the S2R complex, CT1812 displaces Aβ oligomers from their neuronal receptors. Based on this mechanism, we believe CT1812 has the potential to slow the loss of synapses and cognitive decline observed in AD. CT1812 is the first S2R selective ligand modulator to reach clinical trials and is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of AD. The direct healthcare costs to care for patients with AD and other dementias in the U.S. is estimated as of April 18, 2022 to exceed $300 billion. Approximately 6.5 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with AD, and the World Health Organization estimates that AD affects as many as 35 million people globally. Among people with AD, approximately 50% have mild disease, 30% have moderate disease and 20% have severe disease.
We are continuing to enroll patients in two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials with CT1812: COG0201 (SHINE) and COG1201 (SHIMMER) in dementia with Lewy bodies, or DLB. Preliminary results from an interim analysis of the first 24 patients in Part A of our SHINE Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a statistically significant decline in the presence of Aβ monomers and a positive trend on cognitive function as measured by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, or ADAS-Cog, in patients receiving CT1812 compared to placebo. We anticipate completing enrollment in 2023 with top-line data expected in 2024. We have treated over 220 subjects with CT1812 in our clinical trials to date including over 90 patients with mild-to-moderate AD. CT1812 has continued to be well tolerated and has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in this indication.
Our clinical trials have been funded by approximately $171.0 million in cumulative grants awarded primarily by the National Institute of Aging, or NIA, a division of the National Institutes of Health. Our awards include a grant award of approximately $81.0 million from the NIA to fund our Phase 2 START (COG0203) study of CT1812 in patients with early stage AD. We intend to enroll 540 patients in our START trial with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, due to AD or mild AD who have elevated levels of Aβ oligomers as determined by a clinical diagnosis of AD confirmed with amyloid biomarkers positron emission tomography, or PET, imaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, biomarkers. Patients will be randomized to receive CT1812 or a placebo for 18 months. In addition to cognitive and functional measures, such as the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, or CDR, Sum of Boxes, or SB, and ADAS-Cog, we intend to use a variety of biomarkers to measure target and/or pathway engagement and assess changes in neurodegeneration and disease progression. We are conducting this clinical trial in collaboration with the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trial Consortium, or ACTC, an NIA-funded clinical trials network designed to accelerate studies for therapeutics for AD and related dementias, and we expect to open sites during the first half of 2023.
We intend to expand our CT1812 pipeline to include additional indications such as geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration, or dry AMD. GA is an advanced form of dry AMD. Dry AMD is an eye disease that results in the deterioration of the macula, causing distortion, loss of central vision and eventual blindness, for which there are currently no FDA approved treatments. The S2R complex is expressed in the retina in several cell types including the retinal pigment epithelial cells, or RPE, photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells. We

believe that an S2R modulator, such as CT1812, may help to regulate the damage-response processes related to these cells that are impaired in GA secondary to dry AMD. We submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA at the end of 2022; the IND was cleared at the end of January 2023. Our first trial in dAMD is a Phase 2 trial called MAGNIFY and we plan initiate this in 2023.
In addition, we are developing other product candidates in the area of synucleinopathies. Synucleinopathies are a group of degenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the α-synuclein protein in neural cell bodies, including Parkinson’s disease, or PD, and DLB.
Our Pipeline
We are developing a pipeline of innovative, small molecule product candidates that are designed to target the S2R complex, a key regulator of the cellular damage response for diseases such as AD, dry AMD, geographic atrophy (an advanced form of dry AMD), or GA, and other conditions for which there is significant unmet medical need. Our current pipeline is summarized below:
​
​
Mild-to-Moderate AD
We are currently engaged in two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, designed to evaluate safety, dosing and potential efficacy for CT1812 as a treatment for mild-to-moderate AD. These trials include evaluations of CT1812’s ability to engage with the S2R complex enabling the restoration of synaptic function as measured by quantitative EEG, or qEEG. In the largest of these trials, our COG0201 SHINE study, we are assessing CT1812’s ability to alter disease progression and cognition, with a target enrollment of 144 participants. We are currently recruiting patients at sites in the United States and Europe, with additional sites expected to activate in 2023.
Early-stage AD
We plan to evaluate CT1812 in a 540-patient Phase 2 COG0203 START clinical trial to investigate the potential for CT1812’s use at an earlier stage of AD. In addition to cognitive and functional measures, such as CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes), ADAS-Cog and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, or vMRI, we intend to use a variety of biomarkers to measure target and/or pathway engagement and assess changes in neurodegeneration and disease progression. We expect to open sites in the first half of 2023. This trial has been funded by a grant of approximately $81.0 million from the NIA.

7



DLB
We are evaluating CT1812 in a 120-patient Phase 2 COG1201 SHIMMER clinical trial to investigate the potential for CT1812’s use as a disease-modifying agent in DLB. We are assessing cognitive and functional measures such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Cognitive Drug Research Battery (CDR), Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation (CAF), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale — Part III (MDS-UPDRS3), Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC), ADCS-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). We are currently recruiting patients in the United States. The trial has been funded by a grant of approximately $30.0 million from the NIA.
Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Dry AMD
We are also evaluating the use of CT1812 to treat GA secondary to dry AMD. We believe that human genetic and proteomic pathway analyses obtained through our AD trials provides evidence of a relationship between the S2R complex and dry AMD. We are currently engaged in preclinical development activities for this indication, including studies to elucidate the key mechanisms by which CT1812 and the S2R complex alter the biological processes that contribute to dry AMD. We believe that an S2R modulator, such as CT1812, may help to regulate the damage-response processes related to these cells that are impaired in GA secondary to dry AMD. We submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA at the end of 2022; the IND was cleared at the end of January 2023. Our first trial in dAMD is a Phase 2 trial called MAGNIFY and we plan initiate this in 2023.
Discovery Initiatives
We are pursuing a number of early-stage discovery programs which are built upon our identification of five structurally distinct chemical series. We believe we have identified several structurally distinct compounds that possess advantages for specific disease indications and patient populations. A few of these next- generation S2R modulators have been identified for synucleinopathies and dry AMD and are being assessed as potential IND candidates.
For example, one of our next-generation S2R modulators has shown activity in cell-based dry AMD assays, suggesting the potential to maintain homeostatic functions of RPEs, ameliorate lysosomal dysfunction, and prevent RPE cell death. It has further demonstrated retinal exposures above 80% receptor occupancy with oral administration and favorable PK properties, including high degree of bioavailability and high retina-to-plasma ratio, which we believe may provide us with a suitable next-generation molecule to advance for this indication. Therefore, we believe S2R modulators may present a novel therapeutic approach for these indications and intend to pursue development as described below.
Our Strategy
Our objectives are to develop and advance our portfolio, beginning with our lead product candidate, CT1812, through clinical development for the treatment of age-related degenerative diseases and disorders of the CNS and retina and to leverage our understanding of the S2R complex and its regulation of pathways to pursue indications in other degenerative disorders. The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Advance clinical development of our lead product candidate, CT1812, in mild-to-moderate AD and earlier stages of the disease. Our lead product candidate, CT1812, has progressed through Phase 1 and into Phase 2 clinical trials. Funding of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials has come primarily from the NIA. We are evaluating CT1812 in earlier symptomatic stages of AD and MCI, which is a slight and noticeable measurable decline in cognitive abilities due to AD. Our START (COG0203) clinical trial in patients with mild dementia associated with early stage AD has been funded by a grant of approximately $81.0 million awarded from the NIA.

● | Pursue the development of CT1812 for GA secondary to dry AMD. We plan to evaluate CT1812 as a potential therapy for GA secondary to dry AMD. GA is an advanced form of dry AMD. Dry AMD is an eye disease that results in the deterioration of the macula, causing visual distortion, loss of central vision and eventual blindness. We believe that an S2R modulator, such as CT1812, may help to regulate the damage-

response processes related to these cells that are impaired in GA secondary to dry AMD. We submitted an IND application to the FDA at the end of 2022 to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of CT1812 in indication and it was cleared by the FDA at the end of January 2023. We plan to initiate this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage our understanding of the S2R complex to develop product candidates for other CNS and degenerative diseases, including synucleinopathies. We intend to develop and advance other product candidates to treat other conditions, potentially including the synucleinopathies, which include PD and DLB. We are evaluating CT1812 in a 120-patient Phase 2 COG1201 study of CT1812 in patients with DLB, which is funded primarily through the NIA and are currently recruiting patients. Preclinical data published in February 2021 showed that the S2R complex may play an integral role in the pathology of PD and we believe these results merit further study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our pipeline through internal development, in-licensing and acquisitions. We intend to leverage our expertise in drug development and business development to evaluate additional product candidates as well as bring forward novel chemical matter using libraries generated with our Novel Improved Conditioned Extraction, or NICE, screening platform as well as other molecule generation and screening strategies. To achieve this objective, we may supplement our internal development initiatives through selective in-licensing arrangements, as well as investments in strategic collaborations, and partnerships which complement our initiatives. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimize the value of CT1812 and other product candidates in major markets. We currently retain all worldwide rights to CT1812 for all indications. We plan to develop and pursue approval of CT1812 and other future product candidates in major markets. Where appropriate, we may use strategic collaborations or partnerships to accelerate development and maximize the commercial potential of our programs. We and our key opinion leaders believe CT1812 also can be used in combination with other therapeutics targeting AD biologies and thus may have many partnering opportunities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to pursue non-dilutive funding opportunities. The majority of our research and clinical efforts have been funded by approximately $171.0 million in cumulative grants awarded primarily by the NIA. This includes awards totaling $10.9 million in support of preclinical studies and $160.1 million for clinical development, the largest of which was the 2020 award of $81.0 million supporting our upcoming Phase 2 START (COG0203) study of CT1812 in early-stage AD. These grants are non-dilutive and allow us to collaborate with research institutions in pursuing the development of our product candidates for age-related degenerative diseases. We intend to continue our work with these research institutions and plan to seek additional non-dilutive funding for our clinical development when possible.

Our Approach to Treating Age-Related Degenerative Diseases of the CNS and Retina
Age-related degenerative diseases are defined by an age-related decline of cellular function often resulting in cell death. Neurodegenerative diseases, perhaps the most prominent of these degenerative disorders, are a variety of conditions defined by progressive degeneration of nerve cells, or neurons, which often leads to neuronal death, causing decline in cognition or other functions, resulting in decreased quality of life and shorter life span. The two most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD and PD.
To our knowledge, no other biopharmaceutical company has focused solely on stopping the synaptic binding and signaling of soluble Aβ oligomers through the use of small molecule receptor modulators, such as CT1812. We believe our deep expertise in oligomer and synaptic biology provides us with a competitive advantage and led to the creation of (1) proprietary assays that target the critical molecular step causing memory loss and (2) proprietary chemical libraries yielding highly brain penetrant small molecule drugs.
Based on this expertise, we are able to discover and optimize small molecule receptor modulators like CT1812 that we believe represent a functionally distinct and promising approach to synaptorestorative AD therapeutics where neurons remain viable and functional. These molecules were designed to displace Aβ oligomers bound to neuronal receptors at synapses and clearing Aβ oligomers from the brain into the CSF.
In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, other degenerative diseases include AMD. AMD is a common eye disease that results in the deterioration of the macula, causing visual distortion, loss of central vision and eventual blindness. It is the leading cause of blindness in people over 60 years of age and afflicts approximately 11 million Americans, including an estimated 12% of all U.S. adults over 80 years of age. We believe that human genetic and proteomic pathway analyses obtained through our AD trials provides evidence of a relationship between the S2R complex and dry AMD. We are currently engaged in preclinical development activities for dry AMD, including studies to elucidate the key mechanisms by which CT1812 and the S2R complex alter the biological processes that contribute to dry AMD. We believe that an S2R modulator, such as CT1812, may help to regulate the damage-response processes related to these cells that are impaired in dry AMD. We submitted an IND application to the FDA at the end of 2022 to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of CT1812 in indication and it was cleared by the FDA at the end of January 2023. We plan to initiate this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023. Other S2R modulators are being explored, currently in lead identification studies, prior to lead optimization and candidate selection for IND-enabling studies.
The Sigma-2 Receptor Complex
The S2R complex is comprised of transmembrane protein 97, or TMEM97, a four-domain transmembrane protein that forms a complex with progesterone receptor membrane component 1, or PGRMC1. The S2R complex is expressed in the CNS, the retina, as well as peripheral organs, including the pancreas, liver and kidney. Within the brain, the S2R complex is found in several areas, including the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra, and is enriched in neurons as compared to glial cells in the adult brain. In the retina, the S2R complex is expressed in several cell types including the RPE cells, photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells.

10



The sigma-2 receptor (S2R) complex
​
Internal and third-party studies suggest that the role of PGRMC1 and TMEM97, the protein components of the S2R complex, regulate cell damage response processes, including cholesterol biosynthesis, vesicle trafficking, progesterone signaling, lipid membrane-bound protein trafficking and receptor stabilization at the cell surface. In addition, the S2R complex regulates autophagy, the cellular process by which altered cellular proteins are degraded and removed. The aberrant activity of these processes, believed to be triggered by cellular stresses, is a hallmark of the dysfunction related to degenerative diseases. The S2R complex is a key regulator of processes that have been implicated in several age-related degenerative diseases and disorders including AD, retinal diseases, such as dry AMD, and synucleinopathies, such as PD and DLB. S2R affects diverse regulatory functions through specific interactions with the oligomer receptors and other membrane proteins.
We believe the array of degenerative disorders which involve protein components of the S2R complex allows for the potential therapeutic use of proprietary S2R modulators in numerous indications. While a fuller understanding of the molecular mechanisms involving the S2R complex remains to be elucidated, evidence suggests that targeting the S2R complex may provide therapeutic benefit to a wide range of age- related degenerative diseases and disorders. We believe modulating the S2R complex to normalize cellular function may provide a restoration of normal cellular processes.
Biomarker and Imaging-Driven Evidence
Biomarkers have become increasingly important in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases for a number of reasons, including monitoring drug activity in patients, assessing changes in disease pathology during treatment and identifying responder populations for clinical studies. Given that biomarker-enabled therapeutics have a higher rate of success at gaining product approval, we elected to employ biomarkers in our programs to mitigate clinical development risk. To that end, in addition to a number of cognitive tests, our clinical trials use a variety of biomarkers to measure target and/or pathway engagement and assess changes in disease progression. For example, in AD, changes in cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, concentrations of neurogranin and synaptotagmin-1 can be indicative of damage to synapses. In PD and other synucleinopathies, changes in markers such as α-synuclein species, lysosomal enzymes, markers of amyloid and tau pathology, and neurofilament light chain can indicate dysfunction in membrane trafficking and autophagy processes. Quantitative EEG and PET imaging agents as well as vMRI may have utility in several neurodegenerative disorders to measure synaptic function, synaptic density and brain atrophy, respectively.

Our Novel, Improved Conditioned Extracts (NICE) Screening Platform
Chemical structures that we are currently evaluating as potential therapeutics for degenerative diseases originate from our NICE screening platform. The NICE screening platform allowed us to generate proprietary small molecule libraries derived from natural chemical scaffolds through a proprietary process which we refer to as conditioned extraction. Conditioned extraction, a process pioneered by a cofounder, allows us to eliminate undesirable properties of well characterized, biologically active compounds sourced from natural products, while retaining their biological activity. The resulting molecular configurations are then subjected to proprietary functional in vitro screening assays designed to replicate the mature brain and its intricate connections and patterns of electrical signaling. Unlike most other screening assays, such as cells lines derived from immortalized neuronal tumor cells, our use of mature primary neuronal cultures provides us with information-rich measurements more indicative of normal brain function and predicative of functional benefit. We have utilized our NICE screening platform in conjunction with these mature primary neuronal cultures to develop product candidates for our proprietary Early Alzheimer’s Screening System, or EASSY.
The candidate library produced by the NICE screening platform is predisposed to compounds with attractive drug-like properties such as low molecular weight, low number of reactive hydrogen bonds, lipophilicity and relatively neutral chemistry properties. These characteristics reduce the reactivity of the molecules and related toxicities, while also enhancing their ability to cross the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers. As a result, the NICE screening platform was designed to accelerate drug development time while reducing development risk. We believe this platform provides us with differentiated libraries which may lead to development candidates beyond CT1812.
Our Product Candidates
We are leveraging our expertise in the biology of the S2R complex, synaptic function and plasticity, and our understanding of the role of toxic age-related soluble proteins, to construct a pipeline of innovative, differentiated small molecule product candidates that are intended to restore normal cellular damage responses. We intend to develop therapeutics with the potential to overcome diseases associated with age-related toxic protein buildups that disrupt key cellular processes. Our initial product candidates target diseases characterized by dysfunction or dysregulation of the S2R complex that leads to cellular degeneration, as observed in age-related degenerative diseases and disorders, such as AD, GA secondary to dry AMD, PD and DLB as depicted in the illustration below.

​

Our Lead Product Candidate: CT1812
Our lead product candidate, CT1812, is an orally delivered, small molecule modulator that penetrates the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers and binds selectively to the S2R complex; and through its modulation of S2R restores normal function of synapses, as well as critical cellular processes such as autophagy, cholesterol biosynthesis, vesicle trafficking, progesterone signaling, lipid membrane-bound protein trafficking and receptor stabilization at the cell surface. CT1812 originated from our initial efforts with our NICE screening platform which enables the generation of innovative leads. Leads identified through NICE were then evaluated using proprietary in vitro assays designed to better emulate in vitro synaptic activity. We believe the use of these assays allows us to identify functionally active structures which may impact neuronal behavior significantly faster than alternate screening approaches. We currently retain worldwide rights to CT1812 for all indications and are developing CT1812 as a potential treatment for a range of diseases including AD, GA secondary to dry AMD and synucleinopathies, such as DLB.
CT1812 for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
CT1812 was designed to selectively target and displace Aβ oligomers bound to neuronal receptors at synapses by a new and differentiated mechanism of action. CT1812 binds to S2R which interacts directly with components of the oligomer receptor, resulting in displacement of bound oligomers, which are then cleared from synapses. In our preclinical studies, CT1812 has demonstrated the potential to protect synapses, facilitate their restoration and improve cognitive performance. These preclinical results are currently being evaluated through our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials.
Overview of the Disease
AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, dementia and the impairment of daily living activities, along with numerous behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In the advanced stages of the disease, an AD patient is unable to recognize faces, use or understand language and displays a lack of awareness for their surroundings. Continued functional decline ultimately results in the patient’s death.
Due to the size of the affected population and the current lack of effective disease modifying therapies, we believe that AD is one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time. Nearly six million Americans have been diagnosed with AD and disease prevalence is expected to more than double by 2050. The direct healthcare costs to care for patients with AD and other dementias in the United States is currently estimated to exceed $300 billion and projected to increase to $1 trillion by 2050. Absent the development of meaningful intervention in the course of the disease, the number of people diagnosed with, and dying from, AD is anticipated to escalate appreciably as lifespans lengthen, since prevalence increases significantly with age. The Centers for Disease Control listed AD as the primary cause of death for more than 119,000 Americans in 2021. The disease is equally devastating worldwide, with the World Health Organization estimating that as of December 2022 AD affects as many as 35 million people globally.
Currently Approved AD Therapeutics
Only two disease-modifying therapeutic option has been approved by the FDA. Specifically, Biogen’s Aduhelm received accelerated approval on June 7, 2021 and the FDA granted accelerated approval to Eisai’s Leqembi in January 2023. Aduhelm and Leqembi are monoclonal antibodies administered via infusion reported to reduce Aβ plaques and protofibrils, approaches that are distinct from our small molecule approach to modulate the S2R, thereby blocking Aβ oligomers from binding to synapses. The only other therapies approved for AD are indicated to treat the symptoms of AD: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, and glutamatergic modulators and an orexin receptor antagonist. AChEIs are designed to slow the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, helping to preserve neuronal communication and function temporarily. Glutamatergic modulators are designed to block sustained, low-level activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, receptor without inhibiting the normal function of the receptor in memory and cognition. Namenda (memantine), an NMDA receptor antagonist was approved in the United States in 2003. These therapeutic products do not modify or alter the progression of the underlying disease and provide only modest efficacy in treating the symptoms.

13



Therapeutic Approaches in Development to Treat the Underlying Disease Have Shown Little Success
Numerous therapeutic approaches have been evaluated to remedy the causes of AD. Those focused on reducing the aberrant production, or removal, of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein have yielded limited clinical benefit. Development initiatives intended to inhibit hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein and related kinase activity, enhance microtubule stability or block tau aggregation have largely been discontinued due to toxicity or a lack of efficacy. Microglial activation and its role in AD-induced neuroinflammation has emerged as another potential target for therapeutic development as has the proper functioning of processes dictating synaptic plasticity, believed to be of central importance to neuronal activity and continued viability. These efforts have also not yielded meaningful clinical advances.
Among the more prevalent and targeted mechanisms implicated in AD, is the accumulation of Aβ aggregates in the neuronal synapse where disease progression leads to synaptic dysfunction and dysregulation. The accompanying deterioration in neuronal activity ultimately results in neuronal death. As a result, the reduction in the levels of Aβ aggregates at the synapse has been a prominent objective of a significant number of therapeutic candidates, including active and passive immunotherapies, designed specifically to target Aβ aggregates.
We believe a common issue with therapeutic interventions intended to limit Aβ aggregate concentrations in the brain is that they fail to discriminate between different forms of Aβ aggregates: fibrils, plaques and oligomers. Such efforts may demonstrate success clearing fibrils and the largely inert plaques but fail to address the specific neurotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers. Conversely, as exemplified by Leqembi’s clinical results, we believe that preferentially targeting Aβ protofibrils/oligomers has the potential to prevent synaptotoxicity. Our strategy of targeting the S2R to prevent Aβ oligomer toxicity at the synapse is distinct from these immunotherapeutic approaches, but we believe may be complementary.
The Role of Aβ Oligomers on Synapses and the Downstream Impact to Brain Function and AD
Synapses are specialized points of contact between neurons, where electrical signaling and communication takes place. It is well established that synapses are routinely sprouted and resorbed as part of the normal process of learning and memory. Each neuron is covered with an estimated 10,000 synapses and these synapses participate in a complex electrical circuit with other neurons. Neurons do not divide or reproduce as part of normal physiological function.
Emerging scientific evidence suggests that Aβ oligomers, formed over time through the buildup of Aβ and its aggregates, bind to specific parts of the synaptic structure and interfere with the normal process of memory formation. This ligand-like activity confers to Aβ oligomers potent synaptotoxic activity. In response, the neuron dismantles and resorbs the synaptic structure to prevent its abnormal function from interfering with what remains of the normal circuit behavior. If a large enough number of synapses are lost, the neuron dies.
Synaptic loss, however, is not necessarily permanent and synapses can be regained or sprout again once the oligomers are removed. We have observed this process in our research involving preclinical AD models. This observation leads us to believe that displacement of synaptotoxic Aβ oligomers may enable synapses to recover and potentially slow cognitive decline. We are further encouraged by the numerous precedents which exist that demonstrate the therapeutic utility of blocking ligand-receptor interactions in the brain with small molecule drugs capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.
CT1812 Uses a Differentiated Mechanism of Action to Selectively Target Aβ Oligomers
Our proprietary CT1812 clinical candidate employs a novel and fundamentally different mechanism which through alteration of S2R activity selectively facilitates removal of neurotoxic Aβ oligomers. Experimental evidence suggests that Aβ oligomers likely occupy binding sites contiguous to the S2R complex. Binding at these locations is believed to produce structural distortions which inhibit the proper functioning of the S2R complex including its role in regulating critical signaling pathways. The preferential binding of CT1812 to the S2R complex produces changes that alters the binding affinity of Aβ oligomers to their targets. CT1812 binding to the S2R complex likely modulates the conformation of the S2R complex, which in turn allosterically alters the conformation of the oligomer binding pocket on the oligomer 

14



receptors. Binding pocket destabilization leads to displacement of Aβ oligomers from the neurons and neuronal synapse. Once displaced, Aβ oligomers are unable to rebind as long as threshold concentrations of CT1812 are present and are rapidly removed from the synapse. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe that CT1812 not only prevents binding of Aβ oligomers, displacing them from the S2R complex sites at neuronal synapses, but also slows Aβ oligomer-induced loss of synapses and restores synaptic activity, which may reverse downstream alterations related to membrane trafficking.
The Use of an S2R Targeted Approach is Supported by the A673T Mutation
We believe the benefit of the mechanism by which CT1812 stops the toxic impact of Aβ oligomers on cellular function is further supported by an analysis of the Aβ sequence variant, A673T, which is commonly referred to as the “Icelandic” mutation. The A673T mutation is the first variant associated with a mutation in the protein structure of Aβ, first identified through a genomic analysis of the Icelandic population. Importantly, carriers of the mutation are four-fold less likely to develop AD. The A673T mutation, which involves the substitution of the amino acid alanine for threonine at position 673 of the precursor molecule, not only produces fewer Aβ monomers, but our research indicated that the toxic Aβ oligomers generated have four-fold lower affinity for brain cell synapses. This reduced binding is evidenced in the results of in vitro experiments, which are presented below. Whereas wildtype Aβ oligomer binding is pronounced, the binding of the A673T variant is much lower.

We believe that CT1812 is the only drug candidate currently in clinical trials that mimics the effects of the A673T mutation. As the images presented below suggest, both CT1812 and the A673T mutation similarly reduced the binding of toxic Aβ oligomers to synapses. We believe that drug candidates like CT1812 that mimic the protective effects of the A673T mutation are more likely to succeed in the clinical setting in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

CT1812 Clinical Results in AD
We have completed seven clinical trial evaluations of CT1812, in both healthy volunteers and patients with mild-to-moderate AD, with three clinical trials ongoing. The clinical trials we have conducted to date have enabled us to evaluate the safety profile of CT1812, as well as validate its mechanism through proof-of- concept trials and conduct initial assessments of its therapeutic potential. The following is the status of our completed and ongoing clinical trials.
Overview of our completed, ongoing and planned clinical studies of CT1812 for AD and dementia

​
COG0201 — Phase 2 (SHINE) Clinical Trial
Our ongoing COG0201 SHINE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial designed to enroll up to a total of 144 patients with mild-to-moderate AD to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of CT1812. Participants are divided in two CT1812 dose groups (100 mg or 300 mg) and one placebo group, dosed daily for six months. Endpoints include safety and biomarker evidence of disease modification as well as cognitive function, as measured by the ADAS-Cog 11-item version, or ADAS-Cog 11. ADAS-Cog 11 is a globally recognized cognitive scale that is used to assess cognition in patients with AD.
Preliminary data from an interim analysis of the first 24 patients from the COG0201 study demonstrated that CT1812 continued to be generally well tolerated. There were four serious adverse events, or SAEs, which were not drug-related and occurred in a single placebo patient. The patient was discontinued due to one of the SAEs. Treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were well balanced across all treatment groups. We observed mild and transient elevations of liver enzymes in three patients without any other indications of liver injury. These data were consistent with findings from earlier clinical studies.
The preliminary data also demonstrated a significant decline in the presence of Aβ monomers and a three-point mean improvement in the rate of cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog 11, in patients receiving CT1812 when compared to placebo. These results were observed in patients receiving CT1812 or placebo in addition to background therapies they may have already been receiving for AD. We believe these preliminary data provide promising evidence of CT1812’s potential cognitive and biological impact. These data also indicate that patients treated with CT1812 showed relative stability on a measure of cognitive performance compared to the placebo group. A mean difference in the rate of decline of approximately three points was observed between the CT1812 dose groups receiving either 100 mg or 300 mg versus the placebo group based on the ADAS-Cog 11 measurements. 
Preliminary data showed a three-point improvement in cognitive decline in CT1812-treated patients.
​
Proteomic measurements were also performed of CSF and plasma from these patients, from which we have comprehensive datasets of whole proteome changes observed in AD patients given CT1812 versus placebo for six 

17



months. From this, we identified product candidate pharmacodynamic biomarkers that could reflect processes of target engagement, pathway engagement and/or early disease modification.
The interim analysis of the SHINE trial (SHINE A) was not powered to detect statistically significant treatment differences. Nevertheless, p-values were calculated at the time of the interim analysis with respect to the clinical and biomarker outcomes to help inform on the potential importance of observed numerical treatment differences. For these interim analyses, p-values<0.05 were considered “significant” while p values>0.05 were considered “non-significant.” The approximately three-point treatment difference relative to placebo observed for the pooled dose groups that was observed on the ADAS-Cog 11 was non-significant (p>0.05; p=0.1295), while the treatment difference relative to placebo that observed for the reduction in CSF Aβ 42 protein at the 300mg dose was significant (p<0.05; p=0.0178).
Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trials for the Mechanism of CT1812
We have conducted and are continuing to conduct a series of clinical proof-of-concept trials intended to assess target engagement and the impact of CT1812 on synaptic activity. These proof-of-concept trials are presented in more detail below.
COG0202 — Phase 2 (SEQUEL) Trial
Our COG0202 SEQUEL study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of 16 patients with mild-to-moderate AD to evaluate the potential efficacy of CT1812 in restoring synaptic function in patients through qEEG measurement, as reflected by relative theta power. The trial is configured as a two-arm crossover trial, in which half of the participants will receive 300 mg of CT1812 daily for 29 days. After a 14-day wash out period, these participants will receive placebo for an additional 29 days. The other half of the participants receive placebo daily for 29 days. After a 14-day wash out period, these participants will receive CT1812 treatment for an additional 29 days. CSF and qEEG evaluations are taken periodically throughout the duration of the trial. We completed enrollment in the first quarter of 2023 and expect to report topline data later in 2023.
COG0105 — Phase 1 (SPARC) Trial
The COG0105 SPARC study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial of 23 patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate CT1812 for safety and tolerability. The secondary objectives were to evaluate potential effects of CT1812 on biologically relevant endpoints using various imaging modalities, including PET imaging and vMRI as well as CSF biomarkers, and cognitive and clinical endpoints.
Participants were randomized to receive treatment with 100 mg or 300 mg of CT1812 or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. A preliminary analysis has been made of safety, clinical laboratory measurements, PET imaging, functional MRI and vMRI, CSF biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients treated with CT1812 compared to those in patients receiving placebo.
Seventeen patients completed the study protocol, eleven in the CT1812 arm (six in the 100mg cohort; five in the 300mg cohort) and six in the placebo arm. CT1812 was well-tolerated with similar adverse event rates across treatment arms. Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity with no deaths and no treatment-related SAEs reported. We observed mild and transient elevations of liver enzymes without any other indications of liver injury in two patients in the 300-milligram group. The patients were discontinued from the study and the liver enzyme levels returned to normal.
Topline results from the analyses of secondary endpoints demonstrated that after 24-weeks of treatment, there were no significant treatment differences on the ADAS-Cog 11 change from baseline. In addition, there were no significant treatment differences on SV2A signal change compared to baseline. However, vMRI showed a trend (p=0.0641) towards a significant reduction in the loss of composite brain volume in CT1812- treated patients (pooled) compared to placebo. A statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in loss of brain volume was also observed in three brain regions (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and pericentral cortex) in treated patients (pooled) compared to placebo, as shown in the table below.

​
COG0104 — Phase 1 (SNAP) Trial
Our COG0104 SNAP study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial that enrolled three patients with mild-to-moderate AD to measure the effects of CT1812 on displacement of Aβ oligomers. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of CT1812 or placebo. Patients enrolled in the trial had an indwelling catheter placed in the lumbar CSF space. CSF samples were collected hourly over a 28-hour period. Five CSF samples were collected before and 24 samples collected after administration of a single 560 mg oral dose of CT1812 or placebo. CSF samples from each trial participant were analyzed to measure the concentration of Aβ oligomers over the trial period.
Results of this trial revealed an increase in Aβ oligomer levels in the CSF over the 24-hour period following treatment with CT1812, but not in the patient administered placebo. These findings were measured using two independent methods, microimmunoelectrodes and western blots. This effect of CT1812 was specific to Aβ oligomers, as no CT1812-related increase in Aβ 1-40 or 1-42 monomer was observed.
We believe these results provide the early proof of principle of CT1812 target engagement in AD patients. Further, we believe that they corroborate our mechanism of action previously demonstrated in preclinical studies, providing the first evidence that our preclinical studies translate to patients with AD.

​
COG0102 — Phase 1 Trial
Our COG0102 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial of 19 patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Participants were administered one of three oral doses of CT1812, either 90 mg, 280 mg or 560 mg, once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety with a secondary objective of establishing the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of CT1812. Also included as exploratory endpoints were measurement of CT1812 in CSF, and protein expression changes in CSF and plasma.
In order to gauge the impact of CT1812 on synaptic damage due to AD, we measured concentrations of synaptic proteins, neurogranin and synaptotagmin-1, in CSF samples from these patients using clinically validated standardized assays. Our evaluation of AD protein biomarkers in the CSF revealed that neurogranin levels, shown in the left graph below, in patients treated with CT1812 for 28 days was significantly decreased compared to levels measured in patients administered placebo (p =0.05, analysis of covariance). Neurogranin is a synaptic damage marker that increases in the CSF of AD patients reflecting its decrease in the brain. The lowering of synaptic damage markers in the CSF is consistent with CT1812’s mechanism of action as observed in our preclinical studies and demonstrates the potential of the CT1812 to slow Aβ oligomer- induced synapse loss.
Another synaptic damage biomarker that is elevated in the CSF of AD patients is synaptotagmin-1. CSF levels of synaptotagmin-1 were similar at baseline and end of study in patients treated with CT1812, whereas its levels in the placebo group displayed a marked increase over the same time period. This analysis of CT1812’s impact on 

20



synaptotagmin-1 levels is presented in the right graph below. Consistent with our belief that targeting the S2R has the potential to prevent Aβ oligomer toxicity, we observed a reduction in neurogranin and synaptotagmin in CSF, which are measures of synaptic damage, suggesting that CT1812 may have the ability to protect synapses in AD patients.
Treatment with CT1812 was associated with lower levels of neurogranin and
synaptotagmin-1 compared to placebo
​
CT1812 was well tolerated in the COG0102 study. All AEs were mild to moderate. Some of the participants in the highest dose group experienced lymphocytopenia or elevated liver enzymes. These laboratory abnormalities resolved in most patients with continued dosing of CT1812. One trial participant was discontinued from CT1812 prior to study completion because of elevated liver enzymes with subsequent resolution of this abnormality. Lymphocytopenia or elevated liver enzymes were not observed in either the 90 mg or 280 mg dosing cohorts. There were no SAEs.
Our Phase 1 Safety Trials
In addition to Phase 1 clinical trials conducted in our targeted patient population, we also conducted a series of Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers designed to evaluate the safety profile of CT1812, as well as determine potential drug-food or drug-drug interactions. These trials and their results, which are summarized below, indicated that CT1812 was generally well-tolerated.
COG0101 - First in human phase 1 clinical trial
Our COG0101 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending dose Phase 1 multi- cohort clinical trial of 93 healthy volunteers to assess the safety and potential drug-food interactions of CT1812. The trial was conducted in two segments.
The first segment was structured as an ascending single dose trial, in which participants received one dose of CT1812 with increasing doses given to each of six cohorts. In this segment of the trial, eight participants were enrolled per dosing cohort with six participants receiving CT1812 and two receiving placebo. The doses evaluated were 10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg, 180 mg, 450 mg and 1,120 mg. A seventh cohort of six patients received a single 90-mg dose after receiving a standardized meal. All doses were administered as scheduled.
The second segment was configured as a multiple ascending dose trial, that enrolled 39 healthy volunteers, divided in three cohorts of ten participants, with one additional cohort consisting of nine healthy elderly volunteers. Each 

21



participant in this segment of the trial received a single dose of CT1812 each day for 14 days. The doses evaluated in this second segment were 280 mg, 560 mg and 840 mg.
CT1812 CSF concentrations correlated to a >80% S2R predicted receptor occupancy in brain
​
Following completion of each trial cohort, bioanalytical evaluation of plasma CT1812 PK was conducted.
This trial demonstrated that administration of CT1812 in single doses of up to 1,120 mg, administered once, as well as up to 840 mg of CT1812 dosed for 14 consecutive days was well tolerated. Significantly, CT1812 concentrations detected in the CSF correlated to an estimated receptor occupancy in the brain of greater than 80%. There was one SAE in the multiple-dose portion of the study that was deemed unrelated to study drug. There were no SAEs related to the product candidate or TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study.
COG0103 - Phase 1 trial
Our COG0103 study was a Phase 1 clinical trial of 15 healthy volunteers designed to evaluate the potential effects of CT1812 on select CYP isoenzymes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. This was accomplished by assessing its effects on substrates of these isoenzymes: 20 mg omeprazole, 500 mg tolbutamide, 50 mg dextromethorphan and 4 mg midazolam. The 15 healthy volunteers who participated in the trial received the substrates of these isoenzymes two days prior to the initial dose of CT1812 and PK assessments were performed. A dose of 560 mg of CT1812 was administered to each of the trial participants for the following six consecutive days. The day 6 dose of CT1812 was administered concomitantly with the four-substrate cocktail and PK assessments were repeated.
A weak drug interaction was observed between CT1812 and midazolam and dextromethorphan. A lack of any clinically meaningful interaction was observed with coadministration of omeprazole or tolbutamide. Based on the small magnitude of change in PK parameters of the probe drugs observed in this study for the isoenzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, clinically meaningful interactions are unlikely.
Clinical Development Plans and Future Trials
Our Upcoming COG0203 Phase 2 Clinical Trial Fully Funded by NIA Grant of approximately $81.0 million
Our COG0203, referred to as START, study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial designed to enroll 540 patients with early-stage AD and powered to show a change in the rate of cognitive and functional decline. We intend to enroll patients with MCI, due to AD or mild AD who have elevated levels of Aβ as determined by 

22



PET imaging or as measured in CSF. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with the ACTC and will utilize approximately 50-60 sites including research sites associated with the consortium, as well as other qualified sites that are not part of the consortium. Patients will be randomized to receive CT1812 or placebo for 18 months. In addition to a battery of cognitive measures, we intend to use a variety of biomarkers to measure target engagement and assess changes in neurodegeneration and disease progression. We have received a grant of approximately $81.0 million from the NIA to fund this trial.
Preclinical Results
Prior to entering clinical trials, the therapeutic potential of CT1812 was observed in numerous preclinical studies. As is demonstrated in the images below, the addition of Aβ oligomers to neuronal cell cultures resulted in synaptotoxicity as illustrated by the reduced expression of synaptic markers neurogranin, synaptotagmin and SV2A. The lack of immunoreactivity of these three synaptic proteins can be seen in the middle column of the image below. However, the presence of CT1812 blocked the Aβ oligomer-induced loss of synapses, as reflected by the presence of synaptic protein expression displayed in the right-hand column below.
CT1812 prevented Aβ oligomer-mediated synaptic damage
​
Results showed that CT1812 also slowed the loss of synapses that is triggered by Aβ oligomers. A higher resolution image of the cell culture exposed to Aβ oligomer is shown below, before the addition of CT1812, which is presented on the left, and after the addition of CT1812, which is presented on the right. Aβ oligomers shown in red bind to synaptic receptors and reduce numbers of synapses shown in green. The addition of CT1812 displaces Aβ oligomer binding and appears to block the effects induced by the Aβ oligomers, with the synapse numbers remaining at levels similar to normal.

​
The protective benefits of CT1812 observed in these in vitro assays are supported by functional in vivo assessments of CT1812. In one such preclinical study, the memory of mice was tested based on the subject’s ability to recall fear-inducing triggers and its performance in a maze. The mice exhibiting symptoms of AD, depicted by the red bars in the image below, performed significantly worse in both the fear and maze tests when compared to normal, non-transgenic mice, represented by the blue bars. However, after administration of CT1812, the AD mice, represented by the solid green bars, were seen to perform at a level similar to that achieved by normal mice. We believe these results are illustrative of CT1812’s ability to restore synaptic proteins and numbers to normal levels and with it, the animal’s functional capabilities.

​
CT1812 for the Treatment of Geographic Atrophy (GA) Secondary to Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD)
We believe that several lines of evidence suggest that modulation of the S2R complex may provide significant therapeutic utility for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD. Human genetics points to TMEM97 as a promising therapeutic target for GA secondary to dry AMD, as indicated via several large- scale, independent genome-wide association, or GWA, studies. In addition, unbiased pathway analysis of AD patient proteomic data obtained during our clinical trials provides independent evidence of a relationship between the S2R complex and GA secondary to dry AMD.
We are currently engaged in preclinical development activities for this indication, including studies to elucidate the key mechanisms by which CT1812 and the S2R complex alter the biological processes that contribute to dry AMD.

24



 Early proof-of-concept studies with CT1812 indicate a role of S2R modulators in rescuing key aspects of dry AMD including maintaining homeostatic functions of RPEs, ameliorating lysosomal dysfunction and preventing RPE cell death. PK assessment indicates that we can achieve therapeutic levels (>80% receptor occupancy) of CT1812 in retinal tissue through oral administration.
We submitted an IND application to the FDA at the end of 2022 to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of CT1812 in indication and it was cleared by the FDA at the end of January 2023. We plan to initiate this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023. We believe that well-characterized clinical endpoints and a defined regulatory path increase the attractiveness of this indication.
Overview of the Disease
AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age in the United States, afflicting approximately 11 million people in the U.S., including an estimated 12% of all U.S. adults over 80 years of age. Dry AMD is a progressive condition and accounts for up to 90% of all AMD cases. Advanced dry AMD, or GA, affects approximately two million people in the U.S. There is currently one approved therapeutic for dry AMD. Other treatments in development are primarily invasive, including intravitreal injections, stem cell replacement and gene therapy approaches. We believe the limited treatment options available for patients with dry AMD, coupled with newly implicated biochemical pathways, make GA secondary to dry AMD an attractive target for the development of therapeutics.
There are two types of AMD, the first of which is neovascular, or wet AMD, and non-neovascular, or dry AMD. Dry AMD, which accounts for approximately 90% of all AMD cases, is a progressive condition that involves a dysregulation of cellular processes, among which is the accumulation of lipid deposits, known as drusen, that causes a thickening of the Bruch’s membrane. This thickening disrupts the cytoarchitecture of the RPE, and this disruption, coupled with oxidative stress and inflammation, leads to the diminished health and function of RPE and photoreceptor cells, with accumulated damage resulting in cell death and visual impairment.

Limitations of Current Treatments
Treatments for dry AMD and GA secondary to dry AMD are currently limited to vitamins and over-the-counter zinc. While there are no therapeutics approved by the FDA to treat dry AMD or GA secondary to dry AMD, there is considerable development activity ongoing involving numerous targets. Among the areas of ongoing interest are efforts targeting the complement pathway and its role in inflammation, as mutations in this pathway have been associated with higher risk of dry AMD. In addition, cell and gene therapy approaches are being evaluated to regenerate RPE cells and rescue the loss of photoreceptors. Small molecule visual cycle modulators are also under evaluation to maintain retinal integrity. Most of these approaches require invasive administrations.
Rationale for S2R Mechanism of Action
Indications of S2R Involvement in Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Dry AMD
We believe that several lines of evidence suggest that modulation of the S2R complex may provide significant therapeutic utility for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD. First, human genetics point to TMEM97 as a promising therapeutic target, as indicated via several large-scale, independent GWA studies. These studies indicate a genetic mutation known as a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, in the TMEM-VTN locus confers decreased risk for dry AMD. It remains unknown if this mutation confers a change in TMEM97 expression levels. However, knockdown of TMEM97 in in vitro models of the disease partially rescues RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. Investigation of the effects of pharmacological perturbation of the S2R complex signaling is currently ongoing to determine if the rescue of cell death mediated by decreasing TMEM97 expression can be replicated by S2R modulators, such as CT1812.
Unbiased Analysis of Clinical Trial Sample Proteomics Data: Top Disease Ontologies
Unbiased pathway analysis of AD patient proteomic data obtained during the COG0102 and SHINE Part-A clinical trials provides independent evidence of the relationship between the S2R complex and dry AMD. Analyses of CSF were performed to ascertain which predesignated functional disease ontologies may be affected by the administration of CT1812. These analyses identified GA and macular degeneration as two of the top indications affected, with GA presenting the most significant relationship. Subsequent analyses identified several subsets of proteins altered by CT1812 that are involved in dry AMD.
In subsequent analyses examining the overlap of proteins altered in CSF and plasma biofluids of AD patients treated with CT1812 versus placebo, we identified a set of proteins, altered by CT1812 that have been previously shown by other groups to be disrupted in dry AMD or GA, compared to age-matched controls. Subsequent analysis identified several pathways in which these proteins are involved, many of which have known genetic or biological links to processes disrupted in dry AMD. We believe the collective insights provided by these analyses provide early proof of concept that an S2R modulator may be capable of altering AMD relevant proteins and pathways in an aged patient population.
Preclinical Support for Clinical Trials
We believe that proof-of-concept studies indicate a clear role of S2R modulators in rescuing key aspects of dry AMD. Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data suggest a key role of S2R modulators in regulating pathways involved in cell survival and inflammation.

Mechanistic Studies Indicate CT1812 Plays a Role in Cell Survival
and Inflammatory Pathways in RPE Cells
​
Additional functional studies indicate S2R modulators may ameliorate disruptions in homeostatic functions of RPEs, including ameliorating lysosomal dysfunction and salvaging the ability of RPE cells to recycle photoreceptor outer segments.

27



Working Hypothesis of Mechanism of Action in Dry AMD
​
We believe preclinical studies provide further evidence supporting a clinical trial for CT1812 as a potential treatment for GA secondary to dry AMD. PK assessment indicates that we can achieve therapeutic levels (>80% receptor occupancy) of CT1812 in retinal tissue through oral administration. Moreover, as is illustrated in the graph below, CT1812 levels recorded in the retina were similar to those in the brain, suggesting that the doses used to achieve potential therapeutic levels in the retina needed to achieve efficacy will be similar to the doses for AD.

28



Similarities in CT1812 concentrations following oral administration in the brain and retina
​
​
Additional studies have been conducted to elucidate the key mechanisms by which CT1812 and the S2R complex alter the biological processes that contribute to dry AMD. In vivo preclinical studies are evaluating the utility of CT1812 to impede the death of retinal ganglion cells. Not only is it anticipated that these proof-of-concept studies will allow us to further elucidate the mechanism by which the S2R complex modulators act upon the various disease pathologies, but the learnings from this may also inform appropriate patient selection, time of intervention and clinical outcome measurements to enable a successful clinical trial design. 
Planned Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design
We believe that an S2R antagonist, such as CT1812, may help to regulate the damage-response processes related to these cells that are impaired in GA secondary to dry AMD. We submitted an IND application to the FDA at the end of 2022 to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of CT1812 in indication and it was cleared by the FDA at the end of January 2023. We plan to initiate this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023.
We plan to enroll individuals 50 years of age or older that have received a diagnosis of GA secondary to dry AMD, with a best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, score of 24 letters or more, with GA of between 2.5 mm2 and 17.5 mm2. The primary endpoint of the trial will be change in GA lesion area using fundus autofluorescence imaging. The secondary endpoints will include change in the square root of the GA lesion area, low luminance visual acuity, or LLVA, and BCVA, low luminance visual acuity deficit and drusen volume as measured by optical coherence tomography. We will measure these outcomes at three-to-six month intervals.

S2R Modulators for the Treatment of Synucleinopathies
Substantial cellular and clinical biomarker evidence demonstrate that our S2R modulators, including our clinical drug candidate CT1812, have a beneficial impact on the pathways impaired in synucleinopathies, namely the localization 

29



of α-synuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies, which is a chief hallmark of PD and other synucleinopathies. More recently, human genetic evidence has linked SNCA, the gene encoding α-synuclein, to the pathology of synucleinopathies.
We have conducted preclinical studies of S2R ligands in our library, including CT1812, to explore the potential of S2R antagonists to rescue the biological processes that are impaired in synucleinopathies. Subject to discussion with the FDA, we intend to conduct clinical studies in DLB, PD and potentially other synucleinopathies as outlined below.
An Overview of Synucleinopathies
Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders in which the protein α-synuclein accumulates abnormally to form inclusions in the cell bodies or axons of neurons or oligodendrocytes. Two of the primary synucleinopathies are PD and DLB, which each involve motor and cognitive dysfunction. While the cell types and brain structures that are affected in PD and DLB vary markedly between the disorders, synucleinopathies share a characteristic accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates into fibrils, the major constituent of the Lewy bodies that occur inside brain neurons in these diseases.
Increasing evidence suggests that α-synuclein also aggregates into oligomers, and that oligomers are more toxic than fibrils. α-synuclein oligomers contribute to neurodegeneration through a variety of mechanisms including disrupting normal autophagy and inducing synaptic dysfunction and loss. Synaptic dysfunction and loss contribute to the cognitive and motor symptoms of these diseases.
Synucleinopathies are second only to AD in terms of neurodegenerative disease prevalence. In the United States, as many as one million people suffer from PD and an estimated 1.4 million from DLB. According to the Parkinson’s Foundation and the Lewy Body Dementia Association, the direct healthcare costs for patients with PD and DLB are estimated to be approximately $25 billion and $31.5 billion per year, respectively. For PD, these direct medical costs include an estimated $2.5 billion for medications annually in the United States.
Limitations of Current Treatments
Most approved therapeutic products treat the symptoms of the diseases and modulate dopamine. While some existing products provide meaningful symptomatic relief, they have significant side effect risks, fail to address the progression of the disease, and over time gradually lose their effectiveness in treating the symptoms of the disease. There are no currently approved disease-modifying therapeutics for PD or other synucleinopathies.
Rationale for S2R Mechanism of Action for Synucleinopathies
α-synuclein is a protein primarily found in neural tissue that plays a role in neurotransmission. In synucleinopathies such as DLB and PD, α-synuclein builds up in brain cells and forms oligomers that saturably bind to neurons where they impair critical cellular processes, causing synaptic dysfunction and eventual loss. Our decision to pursue the treatment of synucleinopathies with S2R compounds is based on internal and third-party data, indicating that the S2R components PGRMC1 and TMEM97 regulate cell pathways known to be impaired in synucleinopathies, such as autophagy, vesicle trafficking and lipid synthesis; α-synuclein oligomers bind directly to PGRMC1; and synucleinopathies share certain mechanistic similarities with AD, including pathologies related to aberrant oligomeric protein formations.
As summarized below, we believe our preclinical studies provide compelling evidence supporting the use of CT1812 and our next-generation S2R modulators as potential therapeutics to treat synucleinopathies.
As with oligomers of the Aβ protein in AD, oligomers of α-synuclein are highly toxic when bound to brains cells and internalized. This binding causes cellular stress, including three major pathway disruptions: upregulation of the autophagy receptor LAMP2A, dysregulation of lipid metabolism and a reduction in membrane trafficking. The S2R complex components, PGRMC1 and TMEM97, directly regulate these processes, activities which are compromised by the binding and internalization of α-synuclein oligomers.

30



Compounds that bind to S2R and block α-synuclein binding and/or internalization are therefore expected to be disease-modifying.
Preclinical Study Support for Clinical Trials
The results of in vitro studies suggest that S2R modulator, such as CT1812, may have disease modifying effect on the synucleinopathies by reversing pathway disruption and dysregulation caused by α-synuclein oligomers. In work funded by grants from the Michael J. Fox Foundation, α-synuclein oligomers were found to bind to brain cells in culture and are internalized, indicated by the red dots in the image to the left below. With the addition of S2R modulator CT1812, the binding and thus internalization of the α-synuclein oligomers is inhibited as indicated in the image to the right below.

The potential for S2R modulators to reverse the deleterious cellular effects of α-synuclein oligomers is also reflected in the in vitro analysis of LAMP2A expression presented below. LAMP2A is a critical component of chaperone-mediated autophagy, one of several processes that eliminate damaged cellular proteins. Its expression, noted in orange, is upregulated in the presence of the toxic α-synuclein oligomer, likely a compensatory mechanism in response to the cellular insult. S2R modulators, which block membrane trafficking deficits caused by α-synuclein oligomers, are observed to inhibit the upregulation of LAMP2A, as evidenced by the dark and light gray in the below chart. As these antagonists are selective for the S2R complex, their ability to reverse the effects of α-synuclein on LAMP2A expression provides compelling evidence of the S2R complex’s importance in the regulation of this autophagy pathway.
In vitro analysis further illustrates α-synuclein oligomers’ dose-dependent inhibition of membrane trafficking. Importantly, oligomer-related inhibition was noted to be four-fold higher than that observed with high concentrations of monomeric α-synuclein, illustrative of the significantly greater toxicity of α-synuclein oligomers. The addition of CT1812 was observed to reverse the membrane trafficking deficit related to the presence of α-synuclein oligomer, while having no effect on membrane activity when dosed in its absence.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)
We are actively enrolling sites for our Phase 2 clinical trial studying the use of CT1812 to treat patients diagnosed with DLB. The design of this trial is a double-blind, randomized trial involving three dose groups, two active treatment cohorts and a placebo group. We are enrolling 120 patients in a six-month study, with equal participant numbers in each of the three dose groups, with daily (QD) dosing. Eligibility requirements include individuals between 50 and 80 years of age that have received a diagnosis of DLB and have a mini-mental state exam, or MMSE, score of between 18 and 27. Clinical endpoints of the trial include safety and physical activity measurements, cognitive assessments, and PK and pharmacodynamic biomarker analyses compared to baseline measurements recorded at the beginning of the trial. In addition, CSF will be collected and analyzed for α-synuclein content and established patterns of differential protein expression.
Additional Product Candidates
Many degenerative disorders likely involve a dysfunctional cellular damage response mechanism and significant evidence is emerging which highlights the importance of the S2R complex and its components in regulating this response. The complex likely contains a number of relevant binding sites that may allow for multiple disease intervention approaches, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Accordingly, we are actively engaged in a number of earlier-stage discovery programs which are built upon our identification of five structurally distinct chemical series. From these series we have multiple leads which will be optimize each of our lead series. Each of these leads has demonstrated favorable potency with variable selectivity in early preclinical testing and each of the molecular series possesses distinct bioavailability and PK properties, including differences in half-life and blood-brain and blood-retina permeability.
Proposed Synucleinopathies Clinical Program
Subject to additional funding, we plan to study several next-generation S2R modulators derived from chemically distinct series to measure their ability to rescue cell death in synucleinopathies such as PD and DLB. We would also study α-synuclein pathology and motor deficits in two mechanistically distinct in vivo models of synucleinopathies. In 

32



parallel, these studies will elucidate the mechanism of action by which S2R modulators are efficacious in PD and DLB and provide essential data to support potential biomarker nomination for PD and DLB.
Grant Funding
Historically, we have sought grant funding to strategically advance our programs. To date, we have secured non-dilutive funds from the NIA, the Michael J. Fox Foundation and other groups to pursue our commonly aligned interests of developing therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders. Taken together, the company has been awarded approximately $171.0 million in cumulative grants for the advancement of our pipeline programs. Of this, approximately $81.0 million in cumulative non-dilutive grants have been awarded by the NIA to fund development of CT1812 for the treatment of AD. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $89.3 million available from NIA funds for applicable expenses to be incurred in the future.

Each of the grants awarded to us relate to agreed-upon direct and indirect costs for specific studies or clinical trials, which may include personnel and consulting costs, costs paid to CROs, research institutions and/or consortiums involved in the grant, as well as facilities and administrative costs. These grants are cost plus fixed fee arrangements in which we are reimbursed for our eligible direct and indirect costs over time, up to the maximum amount of each specific grant award. Only costs that are allowable under the grant award, certain government regulations and the NIH’s supplemental policy and procedure manual may be claimed for reimbursement, and the reimbursements are subject to routine audits from governmental agencies from time to time. While these NIA Grants do not contain claw back provisions, the NIA or other government agency may review our performance, cost structures and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies and standards and the terms and conditions of the applicable NIA Grant. If any of our expenditures are found to be unallowable or allocated improperly or if we have otherwise violated terms of such NIA Grant, the expenditures may not be reimbursed and/or we may be required to repay funds already disbursed. To date, we have not been found to have breached the terms of any NIA Grant.
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect and enhance our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, in the United States and internationally, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through inclusion in expedited development and review, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
Company Owned Intellectual Property
As of March 1, 2023, our intellectual property portfolio contained nine issued U.S. patents, sixty seven issued foreign patents as well as one pending U.S. provisional application, four pending U.S. patent applications, two pending 

33



Patent Cooperation Treaty applications and twenty four foreign pending patent applications directed to the composition of matter of, pharmaceutical compositions of, methods of use of, and methods for selecting subsets of patients for treatment with our chemical structures, including our lead CT1812. Our current issued patents relating to CT1812 are projected to begin to expire no earlier than 2035, with the composition of matter patent covering CT1812 set to naturally expire in 2035, subject to adjustment or extension of patent term available in a particular jurisdiction. We will likely be awarded Patent Term Extension, or PTE, when CT1812 is approved as a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, that will extend the term of the CT1812 composition of matter patent by up to five years, and we anticipate pursuing additional patents to further protect CT1812 and to further extend the patent term associated with CT1812. We expect to file additional patent applications in support of current and new product candidates as well as new platform and core technologies.
We are the exclusive owner of six patent families that include several granted U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, as well as granted patents and pending patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions, relating to compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of CT1812, analogs of CT1812, and the use of CT1812 for the treatment in certain diseases, disorders and conditions including AD, GA secondary to dry AMD, PD, and synucleinopathies.
The first of these patent families is directed to compositions of matter of CT1812, pharmaceutical compositions of CT1812, methods of using CT1812 for inhibiting amyloid beta effects on a neuronal cell, and methods of using CT1812 to treat AD, and we are the exclusive owner of this patent family in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and South Africa. As of March 1, 2023, this patent family includes granted patents claiming composition of matter of CT1812, pharmaceutical compositions of CT1812, methods of using CT1812 for inhibiting amyloid beta effects on a neuronal cell, and methods of using CT1812 to treat AD in the United States (three patents), Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, South Korea, Russia and South Africa. This patent family also includes a pending U.S. patent application and pending application in certain foreign jurisdictions including Canada, India, the European Union and Hong Kong. This patent family has a natural expiration date in 2035 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in in a particular jurisdiction such as PTE following approval of the New Drug Application, or NDA, in the United States or extension of patent term via a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, following EMEA marketing authorization. Upon approval of the NDA for CT1812 in the United States, the patents in this family claiming compositions of matter of CT1812, pharmaceutical compositions of CT1812, and methods of using CT1812 for inhibiting amyloid beta effects on a neuronal cell, and methods of using CT1812 to treat AD will be eligible to be listed in the FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” or the Orange Book. These patents complement the regulatory exclusivity by providing the basis for an additional waiting period prior to the FDA’s approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) applicant. If an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant were to file its application referencing the NDA for CT1812 before expiration of our composition of matter, pharmaceutical composition, and method of use patents and the applicant asserted that our patents identified on the Orange Book to be invalid or not be infringed, it may be subject to additional waiting periods prior to the FDA’s approval (including a statutory 30-month stay if we sue for infringement, or a shorter period if the patent expires or there are certain settlements or judicial decisions in the patent litigation, starting at the end of the five-year NCE regulatory exclusivity period).
In addition to patent exclusivity, under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, upon any approval in the United States, we believe that CT1812 will be eligible for five-year NCE regulatory exclusivity, during which time no 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be approved that contains the same active moiety as the chemical entity in the CT1812 NDA. When approved in Europe, CT1812 will also be eligible for 10 years of data and market exclusivity which is extendible for an additional year upon market authorization for one or more new indications during the first eight years of the data and market exclusivity period.
 We also own four families of pending patent applications directed to methods for selecting subsets of patients with AD for treatment with CT1812, methods of modulating amyloid beta monomer and oligomer levels using CT812, methods of treating GA secondary to dry AMD with CT1812 and methods of treating various neurologic diseases including PD and synucleinopathies with CT1812, as well as a pending provisional application directed to treating certain subsets of AD patients with CT1812. Any of these applications, if issued, will have a natural expiration between 

34



2038 and 2043, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available such as PTE following NDA approval in the United States as well as any term limitations based upon earlier expiring patents.
Additional Product Candidates
We are the exclusive owner of three patent families that include several pending U.S. patent applications, as well as pending patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions directed to additional product candidates, including CT2168 and CT2074, among others. These patent families have expirations no earlier than 2038 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available such as PTE following NDA approval in the United States as well as any term limitations based upon earlier expiring patents.
Manufacturing Strategy
We oversee and manage third party contract manufacturing organizations to support development and manufacture of product candidates for our clinical trials, and, if we receive marketing approval, we will rely on such manufacturers to meet commercial demand. We expect this strategy will enable us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure, avoiding dependence on our own manufacturing facility and equipment, while simultaneously enabling us to focus our expertise on the clinical development and future commercialization of our products. Currently, we rely on and have agreements with a single third-party contract manufacturer to supply the drug substance for CT1812 and with a single third-party contract manufacturer to manufacture clinical trial supplies of CT1812, and we expect to enter into commercial supply agreements with such manufacturers prior to any potential approval of CT1812. We continue to develop a commercial route for CT1812 API and to meet all requirements for our planned clinical trials. We plan to transfer the API manufacture to a larger third-party manufacturer to support the commercial launch of the product, if approved. The current API manufacturer is able to supply all of our needs for the planned clinical studies.
CT1812 drug product is manufactured via conventional pharmaceutical processing procedures, employing commercially available excipients and packaging materials. The procedure and equipment employed for manufacture and analysis are consistent with standard organic synthesis or pharmaceutical production, and are transferable to a range of manufacturing facilities, if needed. We have selected a larger third-party drug product manufacturer and will be executing technology transfer of drug product manufacture to a larger manufacturer. We will also maintain the current drug substance and product manufacturer as part of our supply chain strategy.
Commercialization Strategy
We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize any products that are approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience.
We may to seek third-party support from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for those products that would benefit from the promotional support of a large sales and marketing force. In these cases, we might seek to promote our products in collaboration with marketing partners or rely on relationships with one or more companies with large established sales forces and distribution systems.
We may elect to establish our own sales force to market and sell a product for which we obtain regulatory approval if we expect that the geographic market for a product we develop on our own is limited or that the prescriptions for the product will be written principally by a relatively small number of physicians. If we decide to market and sell any products ourselves, we do not expect to establish direct sales capability until shortly before the products are approved for commercial sale.
Competition
We face substantial competition from multiple sources, including large and specialty biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed, or on the level of development 

35



of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge.
In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, numerous commercial and academic preclinical studies and clinical trials are being undertaken by a large number of parties to assess technologies and product candidates in the CNS field.
Many of our competitors, either alone or in combination with their respective strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisition activity in the biopharmaceutical sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through sizeable collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retain qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offering. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be product safety, efficacy, convenience and treatment cost.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of March 1, 2023, we had 25 employees, 22 of whom were full-time and 19 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. Seven of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We are dedicated to conducting business with the highest standards of corporate responsibility. Our goal is to build a culture of diverse and passionate people striving to positively impact patients, our communities, and broader society. Our human capital resource priorities include attracting, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. We believe that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace allows our company to best fulfill our mission. We are committed to continuing our efforts to increase diversity throughout our company and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our employees and the communities we serve. 
The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. During 2022, the Company has taken proactive steps to enhance and improve our policies related to employee welfare and engagement.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, nonclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data must be generated, which demonstrate the drug’s quality, safety, and efficacy. Such data must then be organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.

U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, the approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee, either centralized or with respect to each clinical site, before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including potential requirements to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA or the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires either exemption from the requirements or may require conducting clinical research in a pediatric population.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human 

37



clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial or drug candidate. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, which may review data and endpoints at designated check points, make recommendations and/or halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the registration of ongoing clinical studies and posting of clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
Phase One:   The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing;
Phase Two:   The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with the target disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 trials;
Phase Three:   The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk relative to potential benefit and generate the data used by FDA and other regulatory agencies to evaluate suitability for marketing authorization.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Sponsor may voluntarily pause or stop a clinical trial, or the FDA may place a trial on full or partial clinical hold at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or concerns related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to delay or suspend an investigation Following the issuance of a clinical hold or a partial clinical hold, a clinical trial may only proceed after FDA has notified the sponsor that any deficiencies have been corrected and FDA is authorizing the trial to proceed. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct 

38



continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Finally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested by the sponsor. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 clinical trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
NDA Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development nonclinical and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.

39



The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with and approved drug and to enable patients to have continued access to such drug by managing their safe use. It could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may offer conditional approval subject to, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission to and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug candidates are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the drug candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track designated product has 

40



opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. With regard to a fast track designated product, the FDA may also consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any drug candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a drug candidate with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A drug candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a drug candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the drug candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires that the sponsor perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials which must be conducted with due diligence to verify and describe the predicted clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such confirmatory trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date accelerated approval is granted. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trials or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “Breakthrough Therapy” if the drug candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a drug candidate is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug candidate.
Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development, review or approval process. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our drug candidates as appropriate.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record- keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After 

41



approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | clinical holds on post-approval or Phase 4 clinical studies, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under PREA, an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the applicant product for indications in applicable pediatric populations. It must also contain information to support dose administration for pediatric populations where the drug may be utilized. FDA has the ability to grant complete waivers, partial waivers, or deferrals for compliance with PREA. PREA requirements may be waived for applications for approval of drug candidates intended to treat, mitigate, prevent, diagnose or cure diseases and other conditions that do not occur in pediatric populations. Generally PREA does not apply for drug candidates which have obtained an orphan designation, unless otherwise regulated by the FDA. Despite this, separate PREA compliance or waivers may still be required for each product indication. Although noncompliance with PREA will generally not be considered for withdrawal of an approval it may be considered by the FDA as the sole basis for enforcement action such as injunction or seizure as non-compliance and may render the drug misbranded.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such 

42



off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off- label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission and approval of certain marketing applications for products containing the same active ingredient. The FDCA provides a five- year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. The FDCA also permits patent term restoration of up to five years as compensation for a patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for an NCE in the United States. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. During the NCE exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an ANDA or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or a (505(b)(2) NDA), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed in the Orange Book, with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. Any competitor who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the date on which the patent has expired and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification the applicant must send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. If the drug has NCE exclusivity and the ANDA is submitted four years after approval, the 30-month stay is extended so that it expires 7 1∕2 years after approval of the innovator drug, unless the patent expires or there is a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant before then. 
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant 

43



are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. The indications the Company is currently pursuing for its product candidates will not be eligible for pediatric exclusivity because they are age-related degenerative diseases and disorders that do not occur in the pediatric population. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
Other Healthcare Laws
Our activities are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil False Claims Act, and laws and regulations pertaining to limitations on and reporting of healthcare provider payments (physician sunshine laws). These laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced by various federal, state and local authorities including CMS, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These laws include:

● | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the U.S. civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through “qui tam,” or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal liability and amends provisions on the reporting, investigation, enforcement, and penalizing of civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti- Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

44




voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers are required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided, as well as ownership and investment interests held, during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, may subject us to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions including penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and/or adverse publicity. Moreover, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical products.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our industry is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Enforcement actions may be brought by the Department of Justice or the SEC, and recent enacted legislation has expanded the SEC’s power to seek disgorgement in all FCPA cases filed in federal court and extended the statute of limitations in SEC enforcement actions in intent-based claims such as those under the FCPA from five years to ten years.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific details, information on cost-effectiveness, and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time- consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.

45



In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and related services. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. This legislation contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also caps Medicare beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket drug expenses. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Additional drug pricing proposals could appear in future federal legislation.
At the state level, there are also new laws and ongoing ballot initiatives that create additional pressure on drug pricing and may affect how pharmaceutical products are covered and reimbursed. A number of states have adopted or are considering various pricing actions, such as those requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on certain products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of pharmaceutical drug products.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system, including implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription products. In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for products administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some products. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both 

46



governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic products, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those products. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2, 2022, the 2% sequester reduction resumed. The sequester will remain in place through 2030. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
The Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ACA or any of its provisions.
Further changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible but it is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace or revise the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which 

47



could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
