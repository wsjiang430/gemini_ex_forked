 Item 1. Business.
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a novel platform of living medicines based on a rare and potent class of immune cells called invariant natural killer T (“iNKT”) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases. iNKT cells are a distinct T cell population that combine durable memory responses with the rapid cytolytic features of natural killer (“NK”) cells. iNKT cells offer distinct therapeutic advantages as a platform for allogeneic therapy in that the cells naturally home to tissues, aid clearance of tumors and infected cells and suppress Graft versus Host Disease (“GvHD”). Our proprietary platform is designed to facilitate scalable and reproducible manufacturing for off-the-shelf delivery. As such, we believe that our approach represents a highly versatile application for therapeutic development in cancer and immune diseases.
Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel allogeneic, off-the-shelf, iNKT cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases with high unmet need. We are employing iNKT cells in their native form in diseases where iNKT cells have demonstrated activity and accelerated approval pathways exist. These indications include, but are not limited to oncology, and acute respiratory distress (“ARDS”) secondary to life-threatening infectious diseases. Our discovery efforts are focused applying our proprietary technologies to build a broad pipeline of engineered iNKT cells, starting with MiNK-413, BCMA-CAR-iNKT, and MiNK-215, FAP-CAR-iNKT.


The following table summarizes our current product development pipeline:
 

* Autologous T cell program IND-Ready; allogeneic iNKT program in development.
Our most advanced product candidate, agenT-797, is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic, native iNKT cell therapy. Our Phase 1 clinical trial studying agenT-797 in solid tumor cancers, as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, is currently advancing as a priority program. Encouraging early activity was seen with agenT-797 monotherapy and combination, with reductions in target and non-target lesions or disease stabilization in patients, which was presented at Society of Immunotherapy for Cancer (“SITC”) in 2022. We currently expect to have updated readouts from this clinical trial in 2023. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of agenT-797 for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and reported that agenT-797 was tolerable to 1x109 cells/dose and suppressed biomarkers associated with disease progression at SITC in 2022. This POC phase 1 underscores the potential application of INKTs in multiple myeloma and establishes important novel data to support the advancement of our armored BCMA-CAR-INKT program as a potential best in class next generation allogeneic BCMA cell therapy for these patients. Strategic discussions to advance this program are underway.
With the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, we commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of agenT-797 in viral ARDS and reported an encouraging survival benefit of 70%, compared to ~10-22% in an in-hospital control and time-matched data from the CDC. These data were presented at SITC 2022 and we have planned an update from the trial in the first half of 2023 and a formal scientific publication is currently in review. There are currently no approved therapies for ARDS; our data contribute favorably as a potential therapeutic and we plan to externally finance the advancement of agenT-797 in viral ARDS through strategic collaborations. Discussions are underway.
 In addition, we are advancing a pipeline of next-generation allogeneic, engineered iNKT programs. Our two most advanced engineered programs are (1) MiNK-413, an IL-15 armored CAR-iNKT program targeting B cell maturation antigen (“BCMA), and (2) MiNK-215, an IL-15 armored tumor stromal targeting FAP-CAR-iNKT program. MiNK-413 has demonstrated tumor clearance and improved persistence in preclinical models, as well as manufacturing and logistical improvements over current BCMA cell therapies. MiNK-215 has demonstrated robust efficacy in NSCLC and melanoma preclinical models, promoting curative responses, eliminating tumor burden in the lungs, and enhancing tumor specific CD8+ T cell infiltration through tumor stroma. These data and programs were presented at SITC in 2022. These programs are both in preclinical development with investigational new drug application (“IND”) enabling activities underway in 2023.
 MiNK was born out of the veteran immuno-oncology company, Agenus Inc. ("Agenus"). The foundational leadership team is comprised of individuals who were critical to the delivery of the numerous scientific and clinical milestones at Agenus since 2015. In addition to building Agenus from 50 to approximately 450 employees, this team has advanced 17 discoveries to the clinic and secured approximately $800 million in upfront and milestone payments and equity investments through partnering transactions, with the most recent achievement being a significant collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company on a preclinical antibody targeting TIGIT, which included a $200 million upfront payment and up to $1.36 billion in milestone payments in addition to royalties on net product sales.


This foundational leadership team has recruited and assembled a management team who bring extensive industry expertise to our company, including decades of experience in manufacturing autologous and off-the-shelf products. We believe the expertise of our management team, and the established current Good Manufacturing Processes ("cGMP") manufacturing suite, greatly de-risks the challenges often associated with capital-intensive cell therapy companies. The combined team has a strong track record in discovering and developing immuno-oncology and cell therapies as well as executing on value-accretive business development opportunities.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel allogeneic, off-the-shelf, iNKT cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases with high unmet need. We believe that allogeneic iNKT cells exhibit highly adaptable properties for broad therapeutic development, and we plan to achieve our goal by executing a strategy with the following key elements:
•Advance agenT-797, native iNKT cells, in cancer, including solid tumors, as monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint antibodies. Our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumor cancers, which we intend to advance as the priority for agenT-797 development as a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda and Opdivo and demonstrated that the cells can be dosed tolerably alone and in combination with approved therapies. A preliminary update was presented at SITC2022 and a clinical update on the phase 1 trial is planned for the American Association for Cancer Research in April 2023. We currently expect to have updated readouts from this clinical trial in 2023 in indications that may lead to an accelerated path to marketing approval. 
 •Validate broad applicability of iNKT cells through our opportunistic development of agenT-797 in GvHD, a potentially fast-to-market indication, as well as in ARDS secondary to infectious disease.
•Apply our proprietary technologies to build a broad pipeline of engineered iNKT cells, starting with MiNK-413, BCMA-CAR-iNKT, and MiNK-215, FAP-CAR-iNKT, with current expectations of filing IND applications for MiNK-215 in 2024.
•Continue to scale up our in-house manufacturing processes and build our capability to cost-efficiently optimize speed, control, flexibility and scalability. Our allogeneic iNKT cell platform allows for cell manufacturing at step function improvement in scale, cost, and availability. We have launched our internal, automated, closed-system for cGMP production, which is FDA cleared for use in our trials. Our process is designed to provide rapid, scalable production with rigorous quality control and consistent and reproducible product release with minimal risk of batch failure. Our manufacturing process uses healthy, donor derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (“PBMCs”) collected by apheresis, which eliminates a key supply bottleneck compared to autologous cell therapies. The donor cells are processed using a proprietary combination of iNKT cell enrichment, stimulant mediated cell activation, and selective expansion, yielding highly pure iNKT cells essentially without potentially alloreactive T cells (contaminating conventional αß T cells). After robust testing to ensure product purity and potency, iNKT cells are cryopreserved for distribution and storage. Our automated process reduces hands-on time, with the potential to optimize personnel usage and facility qualification and validation processes. These steps increase reproducibility, minimize run failures and greatly increase scalability. 
 •Selectively explore additional strategic partnerships that can enhance the potential of our iNKT cell product candidates and combination therapies. We appreciate that there may be significant potential over time to enhance the efficacy and addressable population of our products through combination of our iNKT cells with other classes of therapeutics. We entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement with Agenus (the “Agenus License Agreement”) in September 2021, which provides us with access to Agenus therapeutic candidates and adjuvants for use in our development activities, subject to rights retained by Agenus. We continue to explore further potential collaborations with third parties, either to bring in access to products or expertise to advance the development and further differentiate of our pipeline. Furthermore, if therapeutics areas of interest reveal themselves beyond our core areas of focus we may look to partner with appropriately qualified partners. 
 Our Approach to Cell Therapy – iNKT Cells
T cells engineered with CARs have changed the paradigm of treatment for patients with B-cell malignancies with high response rates in previously intractable cancers, yet there are limitations to CAR-T cell therapy in both the autologous and evolving allogeneic settings, including practical, logistical and toxicity issues. As a result of these limitations, there is rapidly growing interest in other immune effector cells for CAR engineering, including NK cells,  T cells and macrophages. We believe our approach, harnessing iNKT cells, offers significant advantages over existing cell therapies.
 We are advancing a novel approach through the deployment of iNKT cells, a select subset of T cells with the capabilities to orchestrate both innate and adaptive immunity and the potential to deliver durable memory responses associated with T cell therapies


with the cytolytic power of NK cells. The immune system is a complex network of soluble factors and cellular components that defends the body against cancer and infection, with two main lines of defense: innate immunity (e.g. NK cells) and adaptive immunity (T and B cells).
T cells are key to the adaptive immune response to cancer and infections, and through expression of specific TCRs they recognize antigens displayed on the surface of target cells. The diversity of TCRs arising from gene rearrangements allows TCRs to be generated against a virtually unlimited number of antigens and is the hallmark of adaptive immunity. Remarkably, this mechanism has also led to the evolution of specialized “innate-like” T cell populations which, akin to the cells of the innate immune system, detect molecular markers common among pathogens, infected cells, and cancer, such as lipids or metabolites. Such specialized innate-like T cells demonstrate additional innate characteristics underscoring their hybrid phenotype, such as the expression of innate immuno-receptors and the ability to rapidly respond to cell stress caused by cancer and infections.

Mechanistically, we have observed that agenT-797:
•Homes to tumors; 
 •Activates dendritic cells (signalers that help the immune system recognize tumor cells);
 •Kills M2 macrophages (immunosuppressive cells that constrain the body’s ability to fight tumors);
 •Restores tumor killing capacity of exhausted T cells;
 •Persists beyond our measurement period of 35 days;
 •Are activated by CD1d, the key ligand for the invariant TCR, and by stress ligands for potent tumor killing; 
 •Can secrete a wide array of inflammatory cytokines to clear infections and tumors; 
 •Recruit and activate NK and T cells to regulate the immune response; and 
 •Dampen inflammatory donor T cell activity to naturally suppress GvHD. 
 iNKT cells use an invariant TCR α-chain and recognize the glycolipid α-GalCer, as well as other exogenous and endogenous glycolipids presented by monomorphic major histocompatibility complex (“MHC”)-I-like CD1d. iNKT cells contribute to natural anti-tumor responses through their IFN--production and the subsequent activation of DCs, NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and their presence within tumors correlates with favorable prognosis in multiple cancers. iNKT cells offer distinct therapeutic advantages as a platform for allogeneic therapy in that the cells naturally home to tissues, aid clearance of tumors and infected cells and suppress GvHD. Additionally, we have observed persistence of over 35 days in some of our preclinical models, making iNKT cells well-suited for therapeutic application.
Key Features of iNKT Cells
Combine Key Features of Innate and Adaptive Immunity
iNKT cells offer significant advantages compared to other allogeneic cell types as they can directly attack tumor cells through both TCR-mediated as well as NK-receptor-mediated mechanisms. In addition to their direct cancer targeting and killing properties, iNKT cells are also powerful orchestrators of the immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (“TME”). iNKT cells directly attack suppressive myeloid cells in the TME and recruit and activate NK cells and T cells, a distinguishing feature not shared by other innate lymphocytes such as NK cells.
Potent Cancer Killing
iNKT cells are largely tissue-resident, and a small percentage (less than 1% of circulating T cells) are present in the blood. We believe iNKT cells’ tissue homing properties make them highly suitable for therapeutic application in solid tumor indications. Like NK cells, they respond with wide-ranging effector potential, and express a specific invariant TCR that recognizes CD1d, a key monomorphic human leukocyte antigen (“HLA”)-related molecule expressed in a wide range of cancers. iNKT cells have the capacity to mount strong anti-tumor responses both directly and by activating other immune cells, potentiating endogenous NK cells and T cells within the TME.
In preclinical and clinical studies, iNKT cells have been observed to home to tumor tissues and target CD1d-, NKG2D-, and other NK-receptor ligands expressed on solid and liquid tumors to mediate tumor killing and modification of the TME. The invariant TCR can recognize glycolipids presented by CD1d, arming the iNKT cells with the ability to respond to lipid antigenic stimulation within minutes by secreting a wide variety of cytokines.
Naturally Suited for Allogeneic Approaches
GvHD is an important driver of toxicity with most cell therapy approaches. Unlike conventional α T cells, iNKT cells do not require gene editing of the TCR to eliminate risk of GvHD due to the monomorphic nature of the CD1d ligand of the iNKT cell TCR. Although no allogeneic iNKT cell therapy has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) or any comparable regulatory authority, in both clinical and preclinical studies, iNKT cells have been observed not to cause, but instead to actively suppress, GvHD, lowering the safety risks associated with other allogeneic immune cells. Higher iNKT cell counts following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”) for acute leukemia correlates with lower risk for GvHD, and vice versa.
Enhanced Tolerability
Lymphodepletion is a requirement for most cell therapies and leads to significant side effects. Since iNKT cells are largely resident in non-lymphoid tissue, we believe that allogeneic iNKT cells may engraft better than other allogeneic cell types and thus require less lymphodepletion. We believe reducing or eliminating lymphodepletion would significantly improve patients’ quality of life, increase their ability and willingness to undergo treatment, and potentially increase long-term anti-tumor immunity. Reduced or no lymphodepletion leaves the patient’s immune system in a better condition. A healthy and intact immune system is a key requirement for long-term cancer control.
Ability to Scale and Manufacture Effectively
iNKT cells can be induced to grow exponentially for an extended period of time in our manufacturing process, whilst retaining full immunomodulatory and cytotoxic features and metabolic fitness. This is enabled by a combination of intrinsic proliferative properties of iNKT cells and the proprietary process conditions we use to expand and condition the cells. In our current process we are able to expand iNKT cells over 10,000-fold without inducing exhaustion, and our internal research indicates that we can further increase these yields.
Our iNKT Cell Platform
Our platform builds on the unique features of native iNKT cells and our advanced capabilities for manufacturing and engineering. We believe this enables us to develop a portfolio of robust, highly pure, off-the-shelf, allogeneic products that can be delivered to patients worldwide for treatment of a wide array of indications in cancer and other immune-mediated diseases.
Allogeneic iNKT cell therapy is an adoptive cell therapy that involves the infusion of cells derived from healthy donors. We believe that iNKT cell therapies have the potential to address many of the key limitations of current cell therapy approaches, particularly through the ability to (1) rapidly treat patients real-time after diagnosis, (2) improve response rates and the durability of responses, (3)


address more indications and a broader patient population, (4) improve tolerability, (5) be administered without lymphodepletion and (6) scale at a favorable cost profile. Below are the key elements that constitute our platform.


•Novel cell type bridging innate and adaptive immunity: We are advancing a novel platform based on a rare and potent class of immune cells, iNKTs. These cells have the unique ability to bridge the innate and adaptive immune system, with the killing power of NK cells and memory of T cells, as well as the ability to recruit host immunity and reshape the TME. 
 •Broad therapeutic capability: Our pipeline of native and engineered iNKT cell candidates has opportunity across a range of disease settings, including in oncology and immune-mediated diseases. 
 •Clinical proof of concept: Our three phase 1 clinical trials have demonstrated the tolerability and immune-modulating activity of allogeneic iNKT cells in multiple cancers and ARDS. In our phase 1 trial in solid tumors, we have seen encouraging clinical activity and tolerable safety profile of agenT-797, alone or in combination with anti-PD-1. In our phase 1 study in multiple myeloma, agenT-797 showed early clinical and biomarker activity, with disease stabilization for over 10 months in heavily pre-treated patients. In ARDS secondary to COVID-19, we reported 70% survival in patients treated with agenT-797, compared to 10% in a site-based comparative control. 
 •Proprietary cell engineering: Our engineering platforms enable the discovery of CARs, TCRs, and bispecific engagers. This includes CARDIS, our novel CAR discovery and engineering platform developed fully in house over the last five years. It is a hybrid of phage and mammalian display technologies, enabling direct functional selection from cellular immune libraries. This yields a higher frequency of candidate hits with improved pharmaceutical quality and eliminates tonic signaling at an early stage. The use of fully human single-chain fragment variable libraries lowers risk of immunogenicity, and optimized intracellular signaling domains are designed to synergize with the invariant TCR and the array of other native iNKT signaling receptors in driving tumor killing and limiting off-tumor toxicity. Our technology also includes the development of bispecific engagers, where we utilize IgG-based, proprietary highly selective iNKT engager arms and a fully human antibody discovery suite for developing targeting arms. Our experienced team of molecular biologists, genetic engineers and manufacturing experts has a track record of success in delivering now Biologics License Application (“BLA”)-stage antibodies and we are now focused on delivering iNKT engagers. 
 •Proprietary manufacturing at scale: Our manufacturing process takes place using an existing expert cGMP grade manufacturing infrastructure, using our own in-house production team of cell manufacturing experts. Our manufacturing capabilities include a proprietary closed-system process, minimizing contamination risk. This efficient isolation and expansion process from healthy donors can generate >5,000 doses per batch. 
 •Access to validated Immuno-oncology therapies: We have access to Agenus’ pipeline of immuno-oncology antibodies, both monospecific and bispecific, and immune stimulating adjuvants for our development activities, which creates the 
 

potential for rapid development of combinations and commercial flexibility. Agenus will not be obligated to provide us access to their biological material in certain limited circumstances.
Our Product Candidate
agenT-797
AgenT-797, our allogeneic, native iNKT cell therapy, is our most advanced product candidate and is currently in clinical development across multiple different trials and indications, constituting a pipeline within a single product. We are also developing two preclinical CAR-iNKT programs targeting BCMA, MiNK-413, and a tumor stromal FAP targeting, MiNK-215.
agenT-797 – Oncology
In preclinical studies we have observed that agenT-797 cells have the potential to reduce or eliminate hematologic and solid tumor cancers as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint modulating antibodies, as they (1) home to sites of disease via CD1d and NK related ligands; (2) attack suppressive myeloid cells in the TME to eliminate tumor escape mechanisms; (3) recruit and activate NK cells and T cells for enhanced tumor killing (a distinguishing feature not shared by other innate lymphocytes such as NK and gamma delta T cells); and (4) promote tumor killing without lymphodepletion.
We are advancing agenT-797 in hematological malignancies, like multiple myeloma, and solid tumor indications, both as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint antibodies. These phase 1 clinical trials are underway. We intend to commence Phase 2 studies in indications that are eligible for rapid development opportunities including, but not limited to, NSCLC, squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (“SCCHN”) and hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”). We expect to present updated clinical data for solid tumor indications in 2023.
agenT-797 – GvHD
iNKT cells have the potential to provide the following benefits in relation to GvHD: (1) promoting engraftment success; (2) mitigating or suppressing GvHD; and (3) promoting durable responses in patients with cancer. Our near-term plans are to advance the administration of allogeneic iNKT cells in patients undergoing HSCT to enable a successful engraftment and prevention/suppression of acute GvHD. HSCT is a well-established treatment for more than 50,000 adults and children with malignancies, autoimmune conditions and other serious diseases. The most common life-threatening complication, which occurs in approximately 50% of HSCTs, is graft failure and GvHD driven by immunocompetent T cells in the graft recognizing host tissues. Current pre-conditioning therapies such as cytotoxic chemotherapies produce inferior responses in patients over 65 years old. Furthermore, failure to engraft and downstream GvHD are associated with cancer recurrence or death.
agenT-797 – ARDS Secondary to Infectious Disease (i.e. COVID-19, Influenza)
In preclinical models, iNKT cells have been shown to promote viral clearance and increase secondary anti-viral responses, offering the potential to control inflammation and limit lung tissue damage resulting from ARDS secondary to infectious disease in humans. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of agenT-797 for the treatment of ARDS secondary to COVID-19 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and expanded the trial into viral ARDS secondary to other life-threatening infectious diseases, such as influenza. We have completed all dose cohorts up to 1 billion cells/dose in our Phase 1 trial and presented survival benefit of 70% in severely sick patients with viral ARDS. In addition to survival benefit, we demonstrated that that we can dose the cells to 1x109 cells/dose with no related cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity and importantly, observed signals that the cells may prevent secondary infections.
Enhance iNKT Activity and Expand Targeting through Engineering
We are advancing a pipeline of allogeneic, engineered iNKT cell product candidates that leverage our proprietary technologies to enhance iNKT activity and expand tumor targeting through CARs, TCRs and bispecific iNKT engagers. Our two most advanced engineered programs are (1) MiNK-413, a BCMA-CAR-iNKT, and (2) MiNK-215, a FAP-CAR-iNKT. These programs are both in preclinical development and IND enabling is underway. In addition, we plan to utilize our bispecific iNKT engagers, TCRs and CAR technologies, as well as our access to a large portfolio of proprietary targets, to further expand our pipeline of novel allogeneic, engineered iNKT cell product candidates.
Our CARs are designed to work in conjunction with the invariant TCR and the array of innate receptors expressed natively by iNKT cells. They increase the range of tumor targets that can be addressed by iNKT cells and carry optimized intracellular domains that augment and expand native signaling. The resulting CAR-iNKT cells exhibit an augmented and finely integrated response to the


tumor through a combination of CAR target recognition, TCR activation and innate receptor activation by CD1d or stress ligands in the TME.
In addition to genetically engineered CAR-expressing iNKT products, we are developing bispecific iNKT cell engagers. Our bispecific iNKT cell engagers are designed to expand tumor targeting in tumors that are difficult to treat due to immunologic or biologic factors, which may include low CD1d expression. Our engagers bind to the invariant TCR with one arm, and to tumor targets with the other arm. They extend the range of tumor targets that can be engaged by iNKT cells and are designed to work in conjunction with allogeneic iNKT cells, CAR-iNKT cells as well as endogenous iNKT cells.
iNKT Cell Therapy Combinations
 Proof of concept of iNKT cells as a cancer treatment has been established in extensive public preclinical in vivo data sets. Such data has shown that iNKT cells can decrease tumor burden and improve survival in multiple animal models, including through prophylactic and interventional administration of iNKT cells using xenograft, syngeneic and spontaneous tumor models of solid and hematologic tumors.
We have observed from our in-house research that infused native human iNKT cells are persistent (detectable and active) in mice for over 35 days. This persistence enables flexible clinical development.
We have also observed that allogeneic human iNKT cells are beneficial in reducing tumor burden in an aggressive human leukemia xenograft model. In this model we observed that our human iNKT cells were present in all tissues that contain tumor cells, and also were detected in blood throughout the treatment window. We believe this indicates that iNKT cells home to and are activated at sites with tumor cells, which is different from the observations in healthy mice. This is in line with published data and supports that iNKT cells recognize and actively seek out tumor cells.

 Nalm6-CD1d human leukemia xenograft model  10 million agenT-797 cells injected  Stay in circulation with tumor cells  Home to all tissues with tumor cells  iNKT cells present and active for >21 days  Reduce tumor burden 

 A further active area of our internal research focuses on the combination of iNKT cell therapy and checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies.
Our internal preclinical research indicates expanded anti-tumor activity of iNKT cells when used in combination with immuno-oncology antibodies, including anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. These increase the ability of iNKT cells to control tumors by further increasing immune cell infiltration and reducing metastases. In a highly checkpoint inhibitor-resistant metastatic murine tumor model we have observed nearly complete tumor clearance when the mice are treated with a combination of anti-PD-1 and Fc-enhanced CTLA4 antibodies, and endogenously expanded and activated murine iNKT cells.




We intend to capitalize on our internal research findings and actively pursue preclinical and clinical development of iNKT cells in combination with immuno-oncology antibodies for treatment of solid tumors. Our close relationship with Agenus is a key enabler for development flexibility.
Clinical Data for First Generation iNKT Cell Therapy
Precedent data for autologous therapies in clinical trials using autologous iNKT cells for three different cancers have been published to date: melanoma, NSCLC and SCCHN. Autologous iNKT cells were dosed at up to 1 billion cells per patient, comparable to currently approved CAR-T cell therapies. Among the 33 patients treated in the four previously published trials, there was only one report of a Grade 3 adverse event. In the NSCLC trial, stable disease was observed in 4 of 6 patients (67%). In the SCCHN trials, there was a 37.5% partial response in one trial and a 50% overall response rate (“ORR”) in another trial of iNKT cells co-administered with α-GalCer pulsed antigen presenting cells (“APCs”), comparing favorably to currently available therapies in previously treated SCCHN, which have an ORR of 10% to 18%. Increased numbers of cells producing IFN-, a key activator of the cytotoxic immune response, were observed in most patients in all trials. Tumor targeting by iNKT cells was also predictive of response in SCCHN, with responding patients having five-fold greater iNKT tumor infiltration relative to non-responders.
Our Proprietary Manufacturing Process and Capabilities
Our experienced management team and fully operational cGMP manufacturing suite directly address and greatly de-risk the challenges often associated with capital intensive cell therapy companies. We believe this facility pioneered the industrialization and international distribution of autologous cancer vaccines and later the customization of synthetic, off-the-shelf cancer vaccines, immune stimulating adjuvants and antibodies.
Our allogeneic iNKT manufacturing platform allows for cell manufacturing at step function improvement in scale cost, and availability. We are in the process of scaling up our internal manufacturing process to ensure stable, robust and scalable production for advanced clinical trials and commercialization. Our process is designed to scale up > 5,000 doses per batch. We plan to conduct all manufacturing for native iNKT cells and the engineered programs with our in-house capabilities in 2023, with the exception of lentiviral vector manufacturing. Our automated, closed-system allogeneic cell product batch production is designed to provide rapid, scalable, production with rigorous quality control and consistent and reproducible product release with minimal risk of batch failure. This closed-system process reduces hands-on time and optimizes personnel usage and facility qualification and validation processes. Our proprietary reagents and process generate a product that is over 99% pure iNKT cells that can be stably cryopreserved with full retention of functional properties. We believe this will enable us to further increase reproducibility, minimize run failures and greatly increase scalability.
Immuno-Oncology Combination Therapy Collaboration with Agenus
While we have retained the rights to develop our wholly owned or exclusively licensed pipeline independent of Agenus, we have entered into Agenus Agreement which provides us with access to immuno-oncology antibodies, adjuvants and other potential synergistic combinations, and intend to pursue the development of combination products between our allogeneic iNKT cell product candidates and products in Agenus’ immuno-oncology portfolio. The Agenus License Agreement would require us to enter into a separate agreement governing the transfer of Agenus’ biological material and allows for Agenus to refuse such a transfer in certain circumstances.
iNKT cell therapy adds critical new immune system functionality to cancer patients whose immune system cannot effectively combat the tumor. Infused iNKT cells home to the tumor, where the iNKT cells attack the cancer cells and reshape the TME, attracting additional endogenous immune cells to the tumor, such as T cells and NK cells, and diminishing the suppressive effect of infiltrating myeloid cells. Due to their allogeneic nature, infused iNKT cells disappear over time, at which point the endogenous immune system must continue to provide effective immune surveillance to prevent relapse. While there is significant development opportunity for iNKT cells as a monotherapy, we have also demonstrated the benefits of these cells in combination with anti-PD-1 and/or enhanced anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in preclinical models. We believe current cancer therapy developments indicate that anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immuno-oncology antibodies have the potential to become the standard of care for many tumor indications and will form the basis for most, if not all, future combination therapies in cancer. Access to Agenus’ immuno-oncology products allows us to combine our iNKT cells with immuno-oncology antibodies, creating more flexibility in our clinical strategy, a better window for optimization dosing and timing, and more control over commercial pricing of the combinations.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology with a combination of patent rights, trademark rights, proprietary procedures and contractual provisions. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology in select key global markets. Further, in order to supplement our existing intellectual property protection and support commercialization of current and future product candidates, we continue to seek protection for our technological innovations and branding efforts by filing new patent and trademark applications when and where appropriate. As of December 31, 2022, we own one issued U.S. patent and 28 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. The issued patent is directed to a process for the discovery of TCRs and the term of the patent will expire in 2029. There are two families of pending patent applications directed to TCRs as compositions of matter and filed in the U.S. and other major jurisdictions worldwide; these applications were filed in 2018, and the basic term of any patents granted on the applications would expire in 2038. More specifically, these patent applications are intended to protect intellectual property relating to a TCR for cell therapy targeting NY-ESO-1 and a TCR for cell therapy targeting a PTT. There is also a pending patent application directed to a process for TCR discovery that was filed in the United States in 2016; the basic term of any patent granted on this application would expire in 2036.
Our process to manufacture iNKT cells at scale from healthy donor PBMCs, using cGMP-grade proprietary resources, including a humanized iNKT-TCR mAb to enable iNKT cell isolation and an α-GalCer lipid ligand to enable iNKT cell expansion, is proprietary technology.
In addition to proprietary processes and patents on individual assets, we anticipate achieving a 12-year regulatory exclusivity period for agenT-797 upon receiving BLA approval from the FDA, if approved.
Government Regulation
As a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our iNKT cell product candidates, if approved, will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with cGMPs for biologics.
Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization.
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, reimbursement, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development


process or post-approval may subject an applicant for marketing approval to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters and similar public notice of alleged non-compliance with laws, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions and compliance with applicable statutes and regulatory requirements, both pre- and post-approval, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug and biological product development, approval and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. We cannot predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or if regulatory authorities’ guidance or interpretations will change.
U.S. Product Development Process
To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls, and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
Our biological product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”), and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the drug or biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current Good Tissue Practices (“GTPs”), for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 •FDA acceptance, review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, which might include review by an advisory committee, a panel typically consisting of independent clinicians and other experts who provide recommendations as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. 
 Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Applications
Before testing any drug or biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. After sufficient preclinical testing has been conducted, the conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA before clinical testing can begin in the United States. An IND must contain the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, a proposed clinical


protocol, an investigator’s brochure, a sample informed consent form, and other materials. Some preclinical testing, such as toxicity studies, may continue even after the IND is submitted.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug or biological product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial. The IND seeks FDA authorization to test the drug or biological product candidate in humans and automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trials can begin. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted.
FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay the initiation of a proposed clinical trial or cause suspension of an ongoing trial until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that require the suspension or termination of such trials.
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application.
There is no requirement for a manufacturer to provide expanded access to an investigational product. However, if a manufacturer decides to make its investigational product available for expanded access, FDA reviews requests for expanded access and determines if treatment may proceed. Expanded access may be appropriate when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
Under the FDCA, sponsors of one or more investigational products for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) must make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study, or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides an additional mechanism for patients with a life-threatening condition who have exhausted approved treatments and are unable to participate in clinical trials to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, are the subject of an active IND, and are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Unlike the expanded access framework described above, the Right to Try Pathway does not require FDA to review or approve requests for use of the investigational product. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients under the Right to Try Act.
Human Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.


A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the United States. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements intended to ensure the protection of human subjects and the quality and integrity of the study data, including requirements for review and approval by an independent ethics committee and obtaining subjects’ informed consent.
For clinical trials conducted in the United States, an IND is required, and each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Clinical trials must also comply with extensive GCP rules and the requirements for obtaining subjects’ informed consent. The FDA, IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, including GCP, or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. Finally, research activities involving infectious agents, hazardous chemicals, recombinant DNA and genetically altered organisms and agents may be subject to review and approval of an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), in accordance with National Institute of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. 
 •Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk to benefit profile of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety or effectiveness after approval. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs or biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board, an independent group of experts that evaluates study data for safety and makes recommendations concerning continuation, modification or termination of clinical trials, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical


trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (the “PREA”), a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must submit a pediatric study plan to FDA outlining the proposed pediatric study or studies they plan to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The FDA must then review the information submitted, consult with the sponsor and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements, under specified circumstances. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information in clinical trial registries exist in the European Union and in other countries outside the United States.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the premarketing application for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all as the FDA has significant discretion to approve or reject BLAs and to require additional preclinical or clinical studies.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the


applicant, and six months for a priority review application. A major amendment to a BLA submitted at any time during the review cycle, including in response to a request from the FDA, may extend the goal date by three months. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority applications. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity.
During its review of a BLA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions about a BLA.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (“HSCT/Ps”), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA GTP regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HSCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter, which generally outlines the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s safety or efficacy after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has several programs designed to expedite the development and approval of drugs and biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, accelerated approval, and regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation. These designations are not mutually exclusive, and a product candidate may qualify for one or more of these programs. While these programs are intended to expedite product development and approval, they do not alter the standards for FDA approval.
First, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have more frequent interactions with the FDA


and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Fourth, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to confirm efficacy using a clinically meaningful endpoint, thereby confirming efficacy observed pre-approval using a surrogate endpoint. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval.
Fifth, a product may receive RMAT designation, which provides for an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine therapies that are intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for life-threatening diseases or conditions. Similar to Breakthrough Therapy designation, the RMAT designation allows companies developing regenerative medicine therapies to work earlier, more closely, and frequently with the FDA, and RMAT-designated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. Regenerative medicine therapies include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 1271. The FDA confirmed that gene therapies, including genetically modified cells that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues, may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. For product candidates that have received a RMAT designation, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. The timing of a sponsor’s request for designation and FDA response are the same as for the Breakthrough Therapy designation program.
We cannot be sure that any of our product candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a product candidate does qualify, that it will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review.
Post-Approval Requirements
Upon FDA approval of a BLA, the sponsor must comply with extensive post approval regulatory requirements applicable to drugs and biological products, including any additional post approval requirements that the FDA may impose as part of the approval process. These post-approval requirements include, among other things:
•record keeping requirements; 
 

•reporting of certain adverse experiences with the product and production problems to the FDA; 
 •submission of updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA; 
 •drug sampling and distribution requirements; 
 •notifying FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing and labeling changes; and 
 •compliance with requirements concerning advertising, promotional labeling, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and other promotional activities. 
 Additionally, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced regulatory inspections for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP and pharmacovigilance regulations. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
The FDA strictly regulates the advertising and labeling of prescription drug products, including both prescription drugs and biological products. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. In addition, the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or dosing regimens, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
The FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or issues with manufacturing processes, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety signals; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product recall, seizure, or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 Orphan Drug Designation
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop drug and biological products intended for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for certain tax credits. In addition, if a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following product approval unless the subsequent product candidate is demonstrated to be clinically superior. Absent a showing of clinical superiority, the FDA cannot approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the


same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug or biologic. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. To qualify for orphan exclusivity, however, the drug must be clinically superior to the previously approved product that is the same drug for the same condition.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent regulatory exclusivity in the United States. Specifically, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for the attachment of an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to the term of any remaining regulatory exclusivity or patent periods at the time the pediatric exclusivity is granted. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data, even if the data do not show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "PPACA"), which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the "BPCIA"). The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. FDA has approved over 20 biosimilar products for use in the United States to date. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biological product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. This 12-year exclusivity period is referred to as the reference product exclusivity period and bars approval of a biosimilar but notably does not prevent approval of a competing product pursuant to a full BLA (i.e., containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product). The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar.
There have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as judicial challenges seeking to repeal, modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if those efforts continue and if the ACA is repealed, substantially modified or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug or biological product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one half the time between the effective date a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of a marketing application less any dime during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date less any dime during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the


expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry, and particularly the immuno-oncology field, is characterized by rapidly advancing and changing technologies with intense competition. Cell therapy is one of the most active areas for the discovery and clinical development of new anti-cancer therapies. It involves the delivery of immune cells to the site of the tumor to mediate killing. We face substantial competition from many different entities, including large pharmaceutical companies, small and midsize biotechnology companies, and academic research institutions. These competitors are focused on engineering multiple immune cell types including NK cells, α T cells and  T cells, in addition to iNKT cells. These products are both autologous and allogeneic (i.e., derived from a healthy donor) in nature and are unmodified or genetically engineered to target ligands with CARs or TCRs. Several companies are also using induced pluripotent stem cells as an allogeneic cell source, which could theoretically have enhanced scalability. Other modalities such as bispecific antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, as well as novel immuno-oncology antibodies, are also capable of enabling infiltration of immune cells to the site of the tumor. For example, many bispecific approaches simultaneously bind one immune cell antigen and one tumor cell antigen, thereby redirecting a patient’s endogenous NK or T cells to the site of a tumor.
Key competitor companies developing autologous CAR-T or TCR cell therapies include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Celgene/Juno Therapeutics), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Kite Pharma), Adaptimmune LLC, Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., and Novartis AG.
Key competitors developing iNKT cell therapies include Athenex, Inc., Arovella Therapeutics (previously known as Suda Pharmaceuticals), Appia Bio, Inc., Brightpath Biotherapeutics and Ambicion Co.. While one of Athenex’s programs is autologous in nature, other iNKT competitor programs are allogeneic in format. We are also aware of competitors advancing glycolipid formulations designed to activate endogenous iNKT cells, including Portage Biotech LLC and Abivax SA.
Key competitors developing allogeneic T cell therapies include, but are not limited to, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Celyad Oncology SA, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. and Precision BioSciences, Inc.
Key competitors in the NK cell therapy space include, but are not limited to, Celularity, Inc, Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Gamida Cell, Glycostem Therapeutics B.V., Nkarta, Inc., Artiva Biotherapeutics, Sanofi and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
Other key competitors in the  T cell therapy space include, but are not limited to, Adicet Bio, Inc., GammaDelta Therapeutics Limited, In8bio, Inc. and TC BioPharm Limited.
Many of our competitors have initiated clinical trials for GvHD, solid tumors and multiple myeloma, settings in which our iNKT cell therapy platform is currently being investigated. We are also aware of competitors pursuing cell therapy drug candidates, including but not limited to stem cell-based approaches, for the treatment of ARDS secondary to COVID-19. Competitors may compete with us in hiring scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Many of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources, as well as more expertise in research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials and commercializing and marketing approved products. Early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, either alone or through collaborative arrangements with large established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive. Our competitors also may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in them establishing a dominant market position.
