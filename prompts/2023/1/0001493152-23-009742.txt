Recent Developments
 
In June 2022, given the FDA’s lack of clarity regarding the CBD industry, the Company pivoted some of its resources to focus on the nutraceutical industry. The Company made further investments in its softgel line for bovine and vegan softgels. The sales approach has been successful and we have closed over ten different nutraceutical contracts. In this same timeframe we have focused on two other natural plant products—functional mushrooms and kratom. These new areas will continue to be a focus area for Panacea in 2023.
 
On November 18, 2021, the Company and an institutional investor signed an agreement for a $1.1 million original issue discount convertible note (the “Note”) financing in which the investor is paying $1 million in gross proceeds. The one-year Note is convertible into common stock at $1.40 per share. We also issued the investor 785,715 warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of $1.40 per share. The warrants are exercisable over a five-year period beginning May 18, 2022. The loan payoff was made on December 15, 2022 for the amount of $1,115,000.
 
Our Competitive Analysis
 
We believe that our competitive advantages are derived from being vertically integrated that allows for extraction, enrichment and manufacturing under a cGMP quality environment: 1) Using pharmaceutical formulation methods to optimize the delivery of various nutraceutical, hemp, mushroom and kratom products, 2) Developing both full spectrum and THC-free products, 3) hemp supply, and 4) utilize Good Manufacturing Practice to produce goods that ensures safe and quality products that deliver consistent dosing. The ability to produce both full spectrum products (those that contain <0.3%) and THC-free products allows us to optimize dosage and delivery to various human conditions.
 
Industrial hemp extracts are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage and increasing speed of recovery with traumatic brain injury. The cannabinoids have also been reported to treat human disease conditions where currently multiple pharmacological products are needed, e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or where there is no current cure such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease, and age-related dementia, to name a few. Cannabinoids have a wide range of possible benefits which we are pursuing through clinical trials and studies.

Research and Development
 
In October 2021, Panacea Life Sciences’ investment in the Cannabinoid Lab at Colorado State University (“CSU”) was realized. The Cannabinoid Research Center is conducting numerous studies and clinical research that will extend our knowledge of how cannabis extracts affect human and animal health. We will work through the center to form multiple research collaborations as well as perform our own studies in multiple therapeutic areas. The Panacea Life Sciences Cannabinoid Research Center is housed in the Chemistry Building in the heart of the CSU campus. The center is expected to be a leader in cannabinoid research nation and world-wide as the industry continues to grow.
Our Sales Strategy
 
As previously described, since our cannabinoid products contain little to no THC, we have the ability to sell our products across the United States and internationally. We have established a multi-faceted sales strategy targeting:

● | global ecommerce platform for fulfilling orders and shipping worldwide where legally permitted; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | direct pharmacy placement; 
● | direct placement in retail stores, salons, spas, athletic facilities, etc. 
● | Intelligent vending machines 
● | E-commerce based systems and social media 

 
In addition, we have established several other sales channels via sales reps, e-commerce (selling directly to customers), large bulk sales to suppliers and to dispensaries. The e-commerce sales platform also works with the commissioned based sales. All sales commissions are tracked and paid via the ERP platform.
 
We also manufacture nutraceutical and other cannabinoid/kratom/mushroom products for several other companies for various white label and contract manufacturing deals. We specialize in bovine and vegan soft gel manufacturing.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
We distribute our products to various businesses across the United States through channels optimized to the individual needs of customers. Our B2B as well as B2C approach allows much flexibility for healthcare providers the ability to recommend specific treatment options using cannabinoids as a replacement for conventional pharmaceuticals.
 
Currently we sell over 60 different product SKUs of CBD and CBG products. In addition, we offer “white label” licensing to retail businesses and contract manufacturing services to smaller CBD companies. We plan to continue to build an integrated healthcare organization by creating products and programs using emerging botanical extracts. We deliver these programs through managed agriculture, pharmaceutical production, physician education, distribution and social media networks. We use our intellectual property in extraction technology, proprietary compounds, delivery systems, and distribution to produce high-quality products in terms of control, consistency, accountability, and packaging.
 
All our products are stored in a secure distribution area in preparation for delivery to various sales channels, healthcare providers and other retail locations. The laboratory and production facility have the capacity for domestic and international delivery fulfillment and for international export. All products are tracked and securely manifested for delivery to retail and medical offices for distribution.
 
We are recruiting key service providers to leverage the power of online sales and social media placement. We have placed products on various online retail sales stores and has launched product sales on Amazon.com. As product ambassadors are secured, we intend to increase its online and social media exposure to advance a business-to-consumer and business to business distribution model.
 
In 2018, we entered into an agreement with Quintel-MC, Inc. to research and define Panacea Life Sciences business and manufacturing processes. The ERPCannabis system based on an SAP architecture was used to develop the base installation. All financial, human resource, payroll, procurement, production planning and materials management business processes are represented in this system. In addition, the system is linked to our e-Commerce web site. This system allows us to update product costing and determine inventory levels which will be critical as the company expands. In addition, sophisticated financial and payroll processing are inherent in the solution; thus, offering investors detailed accounting results related to company investments.

Our Industrial Hemp Supply
 
Our 2020 and 2021 hemp crop was grown in NeedleRock Farms in Crawford CO. In 2021 XXII was the grower and is using organic practices for the crop. XXII is contractually obligated to provide use with $500,000 of hemp from the 2021 crop. We also have several hemp tolling contracts in which the output of crude and or distillate is shared with the growers.
Biotechnology Goals
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to utilize the production of cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp, such as CBD, CBDA, CBG, CBDV and CBN, to produce consumer products. Hemp is being used in cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and animal feed, where we also intend to focus our efforts. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years.
 
The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is attributable to the valuable overlap between phyto-cannabinoids (i.e., plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake”. Clinical trials demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up to 1,500 mg/day. The scientific understanding of the hemp plant’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. One company, GW Pharmaceuticals pls, a leading company developing pharmaceutical drugs and cannabinoid-based medicines, has sought and obtained US and foreign approvals since 2018. EPIDIOLEX®/EPIDYOLEX® (cannabidiol), the first prescription, plant-derived cannabis-based medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S. and the European Commission (EC) for use in Europe, is an oral solution which contains highly purified cannabidiol (CBD). In the U.S., EPIDIOLEX® is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome or Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) in patients one year of age and older.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any direct material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, however such factors could indirectly affect us as well as participants in the supply chain for our products, and our business, operations, vendors or suppliers.
Government Regulations
 
On December 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed the Farm Bill into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and hemp products containing less than 0.3 percent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, including removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substance Act. January 15, 2021, the USDA issued its final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which authorized hemp to be grown and processed legally in the United States and made it legal to transport in interstate commerce.
 
The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.
 
As of the date of this report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD as the FDA has now transferred this area to Congress.
 
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
 
There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in several states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.

Human Capital
 
On December 31, 2022, we had 19 full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees. We believe that our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We believe that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
