Acquisition of VoltH2 Holdings AG
 
On November 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with VoltH2 Holdings AG, a Swiss corporation (“Volt H2”), and the other shareholders of VoltH2 (each, a “Seller”, and together, the “Sellers”) pursuant to which Vision acquired VoltH2 (the “Acquisition”). VoltH2 is a European-based developer of clean hydrogen production facilities for the supply of commercial offtake volumes of clean hydrogen to manufacturers, gas and power traders, industrial consumers, and both heavy and marine transportation sectors that have pivoted away from carbon emitting energy sources and fuels.
 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Vision acquired an 84.1% interest of VoltH2, and together with its existing 15.9% ownership interest, owned 100% of VoltH2. The Acquisition was completed in exchange for 16,818,182 shares of our common stock (the “Consideration Shares”). In connection with the Acquisition, we also entered into an indemnification escrow agreement with one of the Sellers providing for the periodic release of up to 3,536,364 of the Consideration Shares, as well as a pledge and security agreement which granted us a continuing security interest in the Escrowed Shares to secure such Seller’s indemnity obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement. As mentioned earlier the acquisition consideration consisted of 16,818,182 shares of Vision common stock granted on the acquisition date of November 8, 2021, at a closing market price of $5.50. A deemed dividend for the excess share price over cost basis of the net assets of ($1,340,426) was recorded in the amount of $93,840,427.
 
Sale of Dutch Projects
 
On May 6, 2022, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, VisionH2 Holdings AG (“VisionH2”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Volt Energy BV, pursuant to which we agreed to sell our 100% interest in our Vlissingen green hydrogen development project and our 50% interest in our Terneuzen green hydrogen development project and related assets to the Purchaser in exchange for $11,250,000 of cash and the 3,536,364 shares of our common stock held by the Purchaser.
Acquisition of Evolution Terminals
 
On May 30, 2022, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with ETBV, a Dutch corporation, and ETBV’s sole shareholder, First Finance Europe Ltd., a UK company, pursuant to which we acquired ETBV for a purchase price of $3,500,000 in cash and 3,000,000 shares of our common stock. At the time of closing, ETBV’s primary business was the development of 16.4 -hectare port development project for the import, storage and distribution of low carbon and renewable fuels, including hydrogen carriers such as ammonia, methanol, and liquid organics, located in Vlissingen (Flushing) at the mouth of the Westerschelde estuary in the Netherlands.
 
With the sale of the Dutch Projects the Company changed its business focus from developing clean hydrogen production facilities to developing midstream infrastructure for import, storage and distribution of low-carbon energy products and hydrogen carriers to global customers and supply-chains. ETBV is developing a bulk liquid import and storage facility for the products mentioned above.
 
The development plan of ETBV consists of three phases. Phase one is the construction of infrastructure including ammonia storage, jetty, rail, and truck loading. Phase two and three consist of expansion of storage capacity and the integration of an ammonia cracker to crack ammonia to hydrogen gas for future distribution via the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB).
 
ETBV has contracted a development team with a proven track record in providing a full range of project development and management services across all aspects of onshore and offshore tank terminal developments. ETBV’s team has many years of experience, staffed by former employees of major industry leaders such as Vopak, Tebodin, Oiltanking, Van Oord and Bluewater. The team possess the capabilities and experience to manage a full and holistic process for tank terminal development as the members have managed numerous projects from conception to operation around the world. Collectively, the team has developed over 8 million cubic meters (“cbm”) of storage capacity and possesses in-depth knowledge and experience with bulk terminal project development. The team has developed a comprehensive and bespoke project development methodology intended to assure an efficient process from inception to delivery.
 
Market Potential
 
We believe Vision Energy can benefit from the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative which aims to diversify gas supplies and speed up the roll-out of renewable gases and hydrogen in Europe. Setting a goal to reach an additional 20 million tons (Mt) of renewable hydrogen –10 Mt domestically produced, and 10 Mt imported –in addition to the 5.6 Mt foreseen under the European Commission renewable energy initiative “Fit for 55”, going beyond the targets of the European Union (EU)’s hydrogen strategy. Vision Energy assets are located in proximity to a future H2 Backbone connection planned in Zeeland, Netherlands. Governments have committed to decarbonize shipping by 2050, supporting industrial-scale zero-emission shipping projects through national and regional action, and delivering the policy measures that will make zero-emission shipping the default choice by 2030. Worldwide production of ammonia is around 180 million tons per year and the demand is increasing due to large scale agricultural activities. More than 80 % of ammonia is used as feed stock for production of fertilizers. The rest is used in the chemical industry as feedstock for plastics, fibers, explosives, nitric acid and intermediates for dyes and pharmaceuticals. The potential as a hydrogen carrier may make green ammonia key in transporting energy between continents as renewable energy markets thrive.

Competition
 
In Europe, the market for renewable energy hubs is growing. For example, in 2021 Global Energy Storage “GES” announced its first major investment at Europoort in the Port of Rotterdam. In addition, a green energy import terminal is to be built at the port of Hamburg by Air Products and Oiltanking Deutschland, which is a subsidiary of the energy company Mabanaft. This large-scale green energy terminal will be the first of its kind in Germany and is expected to start providing hydrogen to Germany by 2026. We believe that all competitors will face a high demand for their products.
Government Regulations; Regulatory Matters
 
Our business activities require compliance with government and provisional regulations, including environmental regulations. Each site must adhere to specific regulatory requirements of the permits. Without environmental permits and compliance with international environmental and health safety and environmental standards, projects cannot reach the engineering, procurement, and construction phase.
Government Incentives
 
We intend to focus on states or regions where government support of a regulatory standard that promotes renewable energy and hydrogen production and consumption. Governments in multiple jurisdictions have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate and promote the use of hydrogen as renewable energy sources. These incentives may take the form of support for infrastructure and hydrogen transportation versus monetary incentives.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2023, we had nine full-time employees. We plan to hire employees on an as-needed basis.
