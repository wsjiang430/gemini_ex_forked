ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 19, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
On July 22, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) 8,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, par value $0.0001, and three-fourths of one redeemable public warrant (each, a “Public Warrant” and, collectively, the “Public Warrants”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $80,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the IPO, on April 7, 2021, the Company issued 2,875,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 (the “Founder Shares”), for which the Sponsor paid $25,000. On June 25, 2021, the Sponsor sold an aggregate of 422,581 of such Founder Shares to the underwriters for a purchase price of $3,675. On July 19, 2021, the Company reduced the offering size of the IPO and 575,000 Founder Shares were surrendered to the Company for cancellation for no consideration, resulting in 2,300,000 Founder Shares outstanding. On September 5, 2021, the underwriters’ over-allotment option expired unexercised, resulting in the forfeiture of an additional 300,000 Founder Shares.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated July 19, 2021, by and between the Company and the Sponsor, and the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated July 19, 2021, by and among the Company, Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC and their respective permitted designees (collectively, the “Representative Designees”), the Company completed the private sale of 3,400,000 warrants (each, a “Private Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Warrants” and, together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) to the Sponsor and the Representative Designees at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,400,000 (the “Private Placement”). The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included as part of the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts and commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred offering costs, a total of $80,000,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, the funds held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the ordinary shares included in the Units sold in the IPO (the “Public Shares”) properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”) (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if it does not complete its initial business combination by July 22, 2023 (or within any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association) or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of the Company’s Public Shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination by July 22, 2023 (or by the end of any such extended period of time), subject to applicable law. Chavant has obtained shareholder approval to extend the date by which Chavant must consummate an initial business combination from July 22, 2022 to July 22, 2023, and funds were released from the Trust Account to redeem certain Public Shares in connection therewith and in connection with an earlier extension, as described below. The proceeds deposited in the 

5




Trust Account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
On July 14, 2022, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting and obtained shareholder approval of the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination from July 22, 2022 (which is 12 months from the closing of the IPO) to January 22, 2023 by amending the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. Certain Chavant shareholders holding 7,046,967 ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, $70,573,278 (approximately $10.01 per share) was deducted from the Trust Account to pay such holders. In connection with the extension, Chavant agreed to deposit $31,450 (at a rate of $0.033 per non-redeeming Public Share) for each subsequent monthly period needed by Chavant to complete a business combination by January 22, 2023.
On January 6, 2023, the Company held a second extraordinary general meeting and obtained shareholder approval of the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination from January 22, 2023 to July 22, 2023 by amending the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. Certain Chavant shareholders holding 96,991 ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, $1,004,600 (approximately $10.36 per share) was deducted from the Trust Account to pay such holders. In connection with the extension, Chavant agreed to deposit $42,802 (at a rate of $0.05 per non-redeeming Public Share) for each subsequent monthly period needed by Chavant to complete a business combination by July 22, 2023. Following the redemptions of the Public Shares described above, the 2,000,000 Founder Shares that remain outstanding represented 70% of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares.
If the Company is unable to complete its initial business combination by July 22, 2023 (or within any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association) (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to the Company’s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction or any other initial business combination within the Combination Period.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction or any other initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction or any other initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
Selection of Target Businesses
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the 

6




time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. However, we may structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
On November 15, 2022, the Company and Mobix Labs entered into a business combination agreement, by and among the Company, Mobix Labs and CLAY Merger Sub II, Inc., a Delaware corporation and newly formed, wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Mobix Labs, with Mobix Labs surviving the merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company (the “Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction”). Upon closing of the Proposed Mobix Lab Transaction, the combined company will be named Mobix Labs, Inc., and its common stock and Public Warrants are expected to be listed on Nasdaq. The Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction includes a $30,000,000 fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share (the “PIPE Investment” and the related subscription agreement, the “PIPE Subscription Agreement”) and is subject to, among other things, the approval of the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction by the Company’s shareholders and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the business combination agreement, including a Form S-4 registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor (the ordinary shares initially purchased by Sponsor in connection with the initial public offering, the “Founder Shares”) and the director and officer holders of Chavant entered into a sponsor letter agreement (the “Sponsor Letter Agreement”) with Chavant and Mobix Labs, pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and the directors and officers of Chavant agreed to vote all of their Chavant ordinary shares in favor of certain proxy proposals relating to the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction, including any proposals the parties deem necessary or desirable to effect the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction. In addition, in connection with Chavant’s initial public offering, the initial holders of ordinary shares and Private Warrants of Chavant, including the Sponsor, the directors and officers of Chavant, and the permitted designees of Roth Capital Partners, LLC and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, which were representatives of the underwriters in the initial public offering (collectively with the Sponsor and the officers and directors, the “Initial Shareholders”), entered into a letter agreement with Chavant, pursuant to which they agreed to vote all their Chavant ordinary shares in favor of the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction. Chavant expects that the Initial Shareholders will vote their shares in favor of all of the proposals that will be presented at the special 

7




meeting. As of March 30, 2023, the Initial Shareholders collectively owned approximately 70.0% of the outstanding Chavant ordinary shares.
Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction or any other initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the marketing fee we have agreed to pay to Roth Capital Partners, LLC and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, who were the underwriters for our IPO. The redemption rights will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our Initial Shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
We may not be required by law to hold a shareholder vote. If we are not required by law and do not otherwise decide to hold a shareholder vote, we will, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules.
Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials to all shareholders and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding ordinary shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the applicable special meeting are voted in favor of the business combination. Our Initial Shareholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of our initial business combination. Each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction. In addition, our Initial Shareholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our Initial Shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) rules. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or Warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. If our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. In the event that our Sponsor, our directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase Public Shares in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases would apply, they (a) would purchase the Public Shares at a price no higher than the price offered through the Company’s redemption process; (b) would represent in writing that such Public Shares will not be voted in favor of approving an initial business combination; and (c) would waive in writing any redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares so purchased.

8




To the extent any such purchases by our Sponsor, our directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates are made in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases apply, we will disclose in a Current Report on Form 8-K prior to the applicable shareholder meeting the following: (i) the number of Public Shares purchased outside of the redemption offer, along with the purchase price(s) for such Public Shares; (ii) the purpose of any such purchases; (iii) the impact, if any, of the purchases on the likelihood that the initial business combination will be approved; (iv) the identities of the securityholders who sold to the Sponsor, our directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates (if not purchased on the open market) or the nature of the securityholders (e.g., 5% security holders) who sold such Public Shares; and (v) the number of Public Shares for which we have received redemption requests pursuant to our redemption offer.
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Warrants could be to reduce the number of Warrants outstanding or to vote such Warrants on any matters submitted to the Warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares or Public Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Limitation on Redemption Rights Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to excess shares without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force the Company or management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including excess shares) for or against the Company’s initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that we will have only until July 22, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete the Proposed Mobix Labs Transaction or any other initial business combination within such period or within any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 22, 2023 (or by the end of any such extended period of time).
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity 

9




groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess similar or greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
Employees
We currently have two officers: Jiong Ma and Michael Lee. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Available Information
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 445 Park Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10022 or by telephone at (212) 745-1086.
