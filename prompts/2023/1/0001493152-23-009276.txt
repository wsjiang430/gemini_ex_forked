Who we are: History and Background
 
We were incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 22, 2013, under the name Intellisense Solutions Inc. We were initially engaged in the business of developing web portals to allow companies and individuals to engage in the purchase and sale of vegetarian food products over the Internet. However, we were unable to execute our original business plan, develop significant operations or achieve commercial sales.
 
We received initial funding in March 2014 in the aggregate amount of $19,980 through the sale of common stock to two of our former officers and directors, who purchased in the aggregate 1,998,000 shares of our common stock at $0.01 per share.
 
On January 10, 2019, we formed Canna Patch Ltd., or Canna Patch, an Israeli corporation, of which 90% was initially owned by our Company, and the remaining 10% owned by Rafael Ezra, Canna Patch’s Chief Technology Officer. Canna Patch did not have any operations and on December 4, 2019, we sold 100% of our holdings in Canna Patch.
 
On September 16, 2019, Intellisense and Medigus Ltd., an Israeli company traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, entered into an Exchange Agreement (as defined herein).
 
On December 30, 2019, we acquired ScoutCam Ltd. As a result of our acquisition of ScoutCam Ltd., we now own all of ScoutCam Ltd.’s issued and outstanding share capital and have integrated and adopted ScoutCam Ltd.’s business into our Company as our primary business activity.
 
ScoutCam Ltd. was formed in the State of Israel on January 3, 2019, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medigus and commenced operations on March 1, 2019. ScoutCam Ltd. was incorporated as part of a reorganization of Medigus, which was designed to distinguish ScoutCam Ltd.’s miniaturized imaging business, or the micro ScoutCam™ portfolio, from Medigus’ other operations and to enable Medigus to form a separate business unit with dedicated resources focused on the promotion of such technology. On December 1, 2019, Medigus and ScoutCam Ltd. consummated a certain Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, which transferred and assigned certain assets and intellectual property rights related to its miniaturized imaging business. On May 18, 2020, in connection with the Arkin Transaction (as defined below), the Company and Medigus entered into a certain Side Letter Agreement (the “Letter Agreement”), whereby the parties agreed to amend certain terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement and the License Agreement.
 
On April 20, 2020, ScoutCam Ltd. entered into an Amended and Restated Intercompany Services Agreement with Medigus (the “Intercompany Services Agreement”), which effectively amended and restated an intercompany services agreement dated May 30, 2019.
 
For additional information about the Exchange Agreement, the Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, the Letter Agreement and the Intercompany Services Agreement, refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
ScoutCam’s vision is to become a leading provider of video analytics based, PdM solutions for the aerospace, other industry and medical critical system markets.
 
We engage companies seeking to add video visualization to their existing or new product(s) or considering the development of new products that include micro video visualization. Our approach to the medical market is ordinarily conducted in two phases. During the first phase, we conduct the research and development that is required in order to specify, design, develop, and produce the designated visualization apparatus, for an agreed-upon compensation amount (e.g., a non-recurrent engineering fee). During the second phase, we manufacture the apparatus and offer it to the customer for an agreed-upon transfer price.
 
In the I4.0 domain, which target PdM and CBM applications, we engage with companies that wish to increase the monitoring capabilities of different elements of a device using our visual monitoring solutions (these include build of image acquisition, data collection and storage, and image processing capabilities based on AI, ML, cloud, and additional algorithm concepts). Based on our product portfolio with customized solutions as needed, this will allow our customers to receive real time alerts on anomalies and failures of monitored components, analyze and track trends and development of the anomaly, and predict any impending failure of the component as a result of such anomaly over time and usage. As a result, we expect customers to benefit from a reduction in downtime, lower maintenance expenses, and increased safety of their monitored equipment, using the prediction capabilities of the platform to efficiently plan maintenance work on future faulty components. Another outcome we expect is more cost effective management of resources, since components will only need to be replaced as a result of their actual condition rather than a strict maintenance schedule.

The use of an image based platform in the fields of PdM and CBM provides richer and more informative data and insights than traditional sensing methods. Together with the AI and ML models customized for the relevant use cases, we expect this will provide customers with a clearer view of the status of their equipment, increasing revenues by saving on direct expenses, and increasing the uptime of their equipment.
 
On February 6, 2023, we announced the completion of a major development stage in equipping Elbit Systems Ltd.’s leading defense UAS aerial platforms with our real time video monitoring system. Through the program, our unique video-based sensors, embedded software, machine vision and algorithms support a variety of predictive maintenance and condition-based monitoring use cases for unmanned aerial vehicles in harsh environments and hard-to-reach locations, as it features a modular open system architecture, enabling seamless integration with advanced unmanned aerial platforms.
 
In order to engage new customers, we employ various marketing strategies. We employ several professional experienced managers in relevant fields of expertise, in addition to a team of consultants who analyze global trends and designated geographical territories to assist us in targeting potential customers.
 
Our marketing efforts include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | engaging third party companies and local consultants as territorial representatives in key markets and leading companies in relevant industries; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | initiating business engagements based on leads received through our marketing efforts, through active interaction with key industry influencers, providing financed proof of concept in order to generate tailored product orders, or via other methods or means; 
● | conducting proof of concept demonstrations in order to evaluate the feasibility of integration for monitoring their systems and to demonstrate the significant value proposition of our technology to customers; 
● | networking through personal contacts in the aerospace, critical industry, transportation, maritime, medical, and defense industries; and 
● | participating in major aerospace, maritime, and vision technology exhibitions as well as industry 4.0 specific events. 

 
In addition to our business development efforts that are mainly based on currently existing or future customer needs, we aim to identify new market opportunities. These efforts include systematic analysis of various industrial and medical fields and procedures to identify where visualization solutions, including image analysis, might add value. When a potential opportunity is identified, we seek to protect our rights by establishing relevant intellectual property safeguards, developing prototypes for the required application. In the medical domain, we currently sell our system to a fortune 500 corporation; in this respect, we seek to partner with additional relevant companies to progress our technology into prototypes which, in turn, will be developed into market-ready products.
 
In January 2022, we entered into a patent cross-licensing arrangement with Japan-based Sumita Optical Glass, Inc. (Sumita), a specialty optical fiber technology company, pursuant to which we granted a non-exclusive license to Sumita to our patents related to “Small Diameter Video Camera Heads and Medical Devices and Visualization Probes containing them” in return for payment of royalties and a grant-back license to ScoutCam of Sumita’s patent and patent applications related to fiber optics illumination. For additional information on our patent portfolio, refer to – “PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND TECHNOLOGY” below.

Our Customers
 
Currently, we have one major customer, a leading Fortune 500 multinational healthcare corporation, that is expected to generate most of our forecasted revenue in the near term. In June 2022, we announced that we completed the verification and validation stage of our miniature camera solution with this client and, on January 26, 2023, we announced that we had received an order from this client for $1.45 million.
 
In addition, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from applications of our micro visualization technology within the medical field.
 
In addition, we announced the completion of a major development stage to equip Elbit Systems Ltd.’s leading defense UAS aerial platforms with our real time video monitoring system.
 
Competition
 
There are currently several companies that develop and provide monitoring solutions for PdM and CBM. These monitoring solutions can be the sensor itself, data collection and storage, AI processing, or a combination of these capabilities. The CBM and PdM solutions are usually based on traditional sensing solutions such as vibration, temperature, and acoustic sensors. Based on our research and discussions with customers, we believe these traditional sensing methods are limited in their ability to provide an in depth view of the condition of the monitored components and usually alert on the occurrence of an anomaly when component failure has already occurred, which is too late in some cases. From the AI perspective, there are several vendors providing off-the-shelf AI capabilities which then require customization per market, use case, and/or data source. We believe that our more holistic approach and reliance on image-based solutions creates richer and more informative data, leveraged by AI and ML algorithms, enabling our customers to deploy predictive maintenance programs.
Proprietary Rights and Technology
 
Our solution for the market is based on our core intellectual property which we seek to review and patent on a regular basis, where applicable. We are heavily invested in creating patents for our core technology.

Our R&D efforts are focused on the following areas: (i) maturing our multi camera solution based on advanced visualization sensor technologies focusing on sensing, computing, and prediction, cooperating with customers for mutual development projects that demonstrate our technology by reaching customer KPIs and (ii) our industrial cloud-based product, which leverages our already in place cloud environment to develop mutual proof of concept and minimal valuable product for our customers that enable cloud base solutions for customer KPIs.
 
Regulation
 
Our approach to regulation is generally determined based on a given project. In our engagements with customers operating in the biomedical sector, we comply with the medical device standards in that corresponding territory, such as the FDA or International Organization for Standardization (ISO), among others. Compliance with these regulations is achieved through our QA department and the support we receive from highly experienced quality assurance and regulatory affairs consultants. In addition, we are being audited annually by MEDCERT GmbH, a German Notified Body.
 
For instance, ISO 13485:2016 is a regulatory benchmark that we comply with while working on our medical device projects. ISO 13845:2016 is similar to ISO 9001 in terms of its quality management system (QMS) requirements, however, ISO 13485:2016 is generally considered more rigorous and comprehensive.
 
Given that we do not manufacture or distribute end-user products to the medical sector, and instead service businesses pursuant to a B2B model, we are subject to fewer regulatory standards commonly associated with medical device manufacturers or distributors. We develop and manufacture components for other companies, and therefore our involvement in the regulatory submission demands comparatively less responsibility. This notwithstanding, we communicate with business customers in order to identify certain regulatory dimensions inherent to a project, to which we should pay additional attention. For example, when a component of ours is integrated into a business’s end-user product, such as for the purpose of touching human tissue, we develop and manufacture our parts and components while taking into account certain applicable regulatory standards. These standards might include, inter alia, relevant FDA regulations (e.g. CFR 21 part 820, the medical device reporting requirements (MDR), among others) as well as ISO regulations (e.g. ISO 14644-1, specifically in connection with cleanrooms and associated controlled environments, among other items, or ISO 10993, in connection with the biological evaluation of medical devices). Furthermore, we prioritize our team’s compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directives (RoHS) and REACH (EC 1907/2006).
 
Similarly, if a component part of ours is incorporated into an electronic device for the purpose of being used inside a human body, we comply with certain FDA requirements as well as IEC 60601 for safety and electrostatic discharge, including the heating of parts at more than 42 degrees Celsius and a variety of additional technical standards designed for the safety and essential performance of electronic medical equipment. Moreover, we perform risk management assessments in accordance with EN ISO 14971:2019 and ISO/TR 24971:2020.
 
In certain instances, our customers prefer that we conduct the testing of its products in internationally certified labs in order to further guarantee that our component parts satisfy applicable regulatory standards. In this scenario, we perform the required tests as a service to the customer and provide the customer with the official test results, specifically in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025:2017, which the customer can later use in order to apply for the required marketing clearance of its end-user product.
 
Since we are seeking to sell our products to customers in the aviation sector, we have completed the process of implementing the AS9100D Standard to comply with aerospace industry requirements.
 
As a U.S. company with foreign offices, we are subject to a variety of foreign laws governing our foreign operations, as well as U.S. laws that restrict trade and certain practices, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Israeli Government Programs
 
As a result of certain agreements between Medigus and ScoutCam Ltd. (for additional information about these agreements refer to – “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE” below) the Israel Innovation Authority, or the IIA, approved a transfer of IIA know-how developed by Medigus in the framework of the Bio Medical Photonic Consortium, or the Medigus Consortium, to ScoutCam Ltd.
 
Accordingly, all rights and obligations with regard to the IIA under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law, 5744-1984, or the Innovation Law, in connection with such know-how now apply to ScoutCam Ltd.
 
The following are details regarding the rights and obligations within the framework of ScoutCam Ltd.’s activity in the Medigus Consortium, which continue to apply to ScoutCam Ltd. notwithstanding the termination of the Medigus Consortium:
 

(i) | The property rights to information which has been developed belongs to the Medigus Consortium member that developed it. However, the developing entity is obligated to provide the other members in the Medigus Consortium a license for the use of the new information, without consideration, provided that the other members do not transfer such information to any entity which is not a member of the Medigus Consortium. The provision of a license or of the right to use the new information to a third party is subject to approval by the administration of the MAGNET Program at the IIA; 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | The Medigus Consortium member is entitled to register a patent for the new information which has been developed by it within the framework of its activity in the Medigus Consortium. The foregoing registration does not require approval from the administration of the MAGNET Program at the IIA; and 
(iii) | The know-how and technology developed under the program is subject to the restrictions set forth under the Innovation Law, including restrictions on the transfer of such know-how and any manufacturing rights with respect thereto, without first obtaining the approval of the IIA. Such approval may entail additional payments to the IIA, as determined under the Innovation Law and regulations. 

 
Obligations relevant to us under the Innovation Law include the following:
 

● | Local Manufacturing Obligation. The terms of the grants under the Innovation Law require that we manufacture the products developed with these grants in Israel. Under the regulations promulgated under the Innovation Law, the products may be manufactured outside Israel by us or by another entity only if prior approval is received from the IIA (such approval is not required for the transfer of less than 10% of the manufacturing capacity in the aggregate, in which case a notice should be provided to the IIA). In general, due to manufacturing outside Israel, with respect to royalties bearing grants we would be required to pay royalties at an increased rate, usually 1% in addition to the standard rate and increased royalties cap (between 120% and 300% of the grants, depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside Israel). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Know-How Transfer Limitation. The Innovation Law restricts the ability to transfer, in any manner, know-how funded directly or indirectly by the IIA (sale of products is not prohibited), unless the IIA approves doing so and subject to the terms of the Innovation Law and of the IIA’s approval. Among other things, transfer of IIA funded know-how outside of Israel requires prior approval of IIA and in certain circumstances is subject to certain payments to the IIA, calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law. If we wish to transfer IIA funded know-how outside of Israel, the terms for approval will be determined according to the character of the transaction and the consideration paid to us for such transfer. The IIA approval to transfer know-how created, in whole or in part, in connection with a IIA-funded project to third party outside Israel where the transferring company remains an operating Israeli entity is subject to payment of a redemption fee to the IIA calculated according to a formula provided under the Innovation Law that is based, in general, on the ratio between the aggregate IIA grants to the company’s aggregate investments in the project that was funded by these IIA grants, multiplied by the transaction consideration, considering statutory depreciation and less royalties already paid to the IIA. The transfer of such know-how to a party outside Israel where the transferring company ceases to exist as an Israeli entity is subject to a redemption fee formula that is based, in general, on the ratio between aggregate IIA grants received by the company and the company’s aggregate research and development expenses, multiplied by the transaction consideration considering statutory depreciation and less royalties already paid to the IIA. 


10
--


 | The regulations promulgated under the Innovation Law establish a maximum payment of the redemption fee paid to the IIA under the above mentioned formulas and differentiates between two situations: (i) in the event that the company transfers its IIA funded know-how, in whole or in part, or is sold as part of an M&A transaction, and subsequently ceases to conduct business in Israel, the maximum redemption fee under the above mentioned formulas will be no more than six times the amount received (plus annual interest) for the applicable know-how being transferred, or the entire amount received from the IIA, as applicable; (ii) in the event that following the transactions described above (e.g. asset sale of IIA funded know-how or transfer as part of an M&A transaction) the company continues to conduct its research and development activity in Israel (for at least three years following such transfer and maintain staff of at least 75% of the number of research and development employees it had for the six months before the know-how was transferred and keeps the same scope of employment for such research and development staff), then the company is eligible for a reduced cap of the redemption fee of no more than three times the amounts received (plus annual interest) for the applicable know-how being transferred. In addition, special rules and payment formulas apply for certain kinds of transfers of know-how outside of Israel, such as R&D licenses. Transfer of IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel not according to the R&D Law may give rise to financial exposure as well as criminal liability. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Approval of the transfer of IIA funded technology to another Israeli company may be granted only if the recipient assumes and abides by the provisions of the Innovation Law and related regulations, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and manufacturing rights outside of Israel (in addition, there will be an obligation to pay royalties to the IIA from the income of such sale transaction as part of the royalty payment obligation). 
● | Approval to manufacture products outside of Israel or consent to the transfer of technology, if requested, might not be granted. Furthermore, the IIA may impose certain conditions on any arrangement under which it permits ScoutCam Ltd. to transfer technology or development out of Israel.
