ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History
 
Health Revenue Assurance Holding, Inc. (the Company), was incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2010.
 
The Company intended to become a provider of revenue cycle services to a broad range of healthcare providers. Offering the customers integrated solutions designed around their specific business needs, including revenue cycle data analysis, contract and outsourced coding, billing, coding and compliance audits, coding education, coding consulting, physician coding services and ICD-10 education and transition services.
 
On February 10, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Anvex International, Inc., “HRAH”), a Nevada company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Health Revenue Acquisition Corporation (“Acquisition Sub”), which was treated for accounting purposes as a reverse recapitalization with HRAA, considered the accounting acquirer. Each share of HRAA’s common stock was exchanged for the right to receive approximately 1,271 shares of HRAH’s common stock. Before their entry into the Merger Agreement, no material relationship existed between HRAH and Acquisition Sub or HRAA. On April 27, 2012, the Company completed a 12.98 to 1 forward stock split. On May 2, 2012, the Company changed its ticker symbol from ANVX to HRAA.
 
The Company then went dormant in August 2014.
 
On July 14, 2020, as a result of a custodianship in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A816259, Custodian Ventures LLC (“Custodian”) was appointed Custodian of the Company.
 
On July 15, 2020, Custodian appointed David Lazar as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
 
AmeriGuard Security Services, Inc. (AmeriGuard) was incorporated in California November 14, 2002. The corporation was incorporated with the issuance of 1,000 common shares formerly held by Lawrence Garcia, President and CEO with 550 shares and Lillian Flores, former VP of Operations with 450 shares. On July 12, 2022, under the terms of a Settlement Agreement, Flores exchanged her 450 shares for the consideration of $3,384,950 and a promissory note in that amount secured by a stock pledge. AmeriGuard provides armed guard services as a federal contractor with licenses in 7 states and provides commercial guard services in California.
 
On September 8, 2021, under the terms of a private stock purchase agreement, 10,000,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Shares”) of the Company, were transferred from Custodian Ventures, LLC to AmeriGuard. As a result, AmeriGuard became holder of approximately 91% of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis of the Company and became the controlling shareholder. The consideration paid for the Shares was $450,000. In connection with the transaction, David Lazar forgave the Company from all debts owed to him and/or Custodian Ventures, LLC.
 
On September 8, 2021, the Company accepted the resignations from David Lazar as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and as a Member of the Board of Directors. Effective on the same date to fill the vacancies created by Mr. Lazar’s resignations, the Company appointed Lawrence Garcia as the Company’s President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. These resignations are in connection with the consummation of the private stock purchase agreement and was not the result of any disagreement with Company on any matter relating to Company’s operations, policies or practices.
 
On March 11, 2022, the Company, amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to AmeriGuard Security Services, Inc. (AGSS) from Health Revenue Assurance Holdings, Inc. The name was deemed effective by FINRA on March 17, 2022.

On December 9, 2022, AGSS entered into the Merger Agreement. AmeriGuard became a wholly owned subsidiary of AGSS, and AGSS its only shareholder and will continue in its existence with one owner, AGSS. Pursuant to the Share Exchange, (a) the Majority Shareholder relinquished all of his 573 AmeriGuard common shares and the Minority Shareholders relinquished all of their 67 AmeriGuard common shares, constituting all issued and outstanding shares of AmeriGuard (the “AmeriGuard Shares”), and were issued an aggregate of 80,578,125 and 9,421,875 respectively of AGSS common shares, representing 86.26% and 10.09% of the outstanding Common Stock of AGSS and (b) AmeriGuard returned the A-1 Preferred Stock of AGSS for retirement. After the issuance of the common shares, the existing 3,417,302 common shares represent 3.66% of the outstanding common stock of AGSS.
 
Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement, by and among Garcia, AmeriGuard, and Lillian Flores (“Flores”), dated July 7, 2022 (the “Settlement Agreement”), AmeriGuard repurchased the 450 common shares of Flores for a total consideration of $3,384,950 payable in five equal annual installments compounded semi-annually at a three percent rate. The initial payment on July 8, 2022, of $686,990 reduced the balance to $2,697,960. The second through fifth installment are due on December 31, 2023, through December 31, 2026.
 
Prior to Merger, under the terms of a stock pledge agreement, by and among Garcia, Flores and AmeriGuard, dated July 7, 2022, 360 AmeriGuard common shares remained held in AmeriGuard treasury pledged to Flores. On Merger these pledged shares were substituted with 50,625,000 AGSS common stock of the 80,578,125 issued to Lawrence Garcia. These pledged shares are redeemed and returned to Garcia based on a stock redemption agreement, by and among Garcia, Flores and AmeriGuard, dated July 7, 2022.
 
The purposes of the transactions described in this Current Report were to complete a business combination by a stock for stock merger and complete a recapitalization of the company with the result being that AmeriGuard became a wholly owned subsidiary of AGSS. Our business operations will now focus on the business of AmeriGuard and its management will be the management of AGSS.
 
There is no offering with this merger.
 
Effective immediately after the Share Exchange, the stock transfer books of AmeriGuard shall be closed.
 
Overview
 
AmeriGuard principally provides guard services to governmental, quasi-governmental and commercial property management. Guard services generated $24 million in revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Guard services include, providing armed and unarmed uniformed security personnel for access control, mobile patrols, traffic control, security console/system operators, fire safety directors, communication, reception, concierge and front desk/doorman operations. As we continue to push growth organically as well as through acquisition, we will be able to realize greater market share in the security industry.

Our Industry
 
Security guard and related services in the US is a $43 billion industry comprising over 11,000 companies and 900,000 officers. Over 55%, ($24 billion) of this market is serviced by 40 companies, with the top 4 firms, with Allied Universal, Securitas, G4S and Prosegur Security controlling 74% ($31.8 billion), an average revenue of $7.9 billion; the next 21 firms control 8.4% ($3.6billion), an average of 172 million and the next 10 firms control 1% ($550 million) with a range of $20 to $100 million with average of $50 million. AmeriGuard’s approximately $22 million in annual revenue places is within the top 25 firms in the country. The rest of the market comprises over 7,900 firms with $19 billion or an average of $2.5 million in revenue. This consolidation of market share has not been gradual but rather a rapid shift over the last five years in an industry which once was highly fragmented and widely dispersed, from smaller regional and local companies to the largest companies.
 
We believe that the top 40 companies have the resources to harness technology, to expand their business into related services other than guard services. Companies with over $50 million in revenue have, over the last 10 years, experienced steady growth while those guard companies under $20 million, the remaining 9,900 firms, have experienced declining revenues. We believe that the principal reason for this is the steady diversification of security services away from the traditional guard services to areas of utilization of technology requiring capital. Along with this, we believe that the profitability challenges below $20 million annual sales are much more difficult that above $50 million is sales, largely due to the significant economies of scale achieve at the higher revenue levels.
 
The proliferation of technology while increasing efficacy in performance and inevitably lower costs in the future, the impact on the contract security industry will likely have mixed results – positive for companies who harness technology into their service delivery strategies – and negative for those companies who fail to invest in or adopt these service-enhancing capabilities. Despite the advances in the U.S. contract guarding business over recent years, there remains a question as to the industry’s viability in view of the increasing trend for integrating manned services with security systems (i.e. security video, access control and monitoring) along with the emergence of other new smart technology options and solutions (i.e. robotics, drones, cybersecurity and crowd sharing alert notification).
 
The recent merger and acquisition trend, primarily by the major national and international security organizations and fueled by investment and funding from private equity firms, is continuing. The underlying reason for this shift is less obvious and suggests an increasing number of sellers who concluded that their better option was to exit and sell rather than remain in the marketplace and try to compete and organically grow their market share.
 
Despite its low barriers of entry and nominal capital requirements, the security guard business has become more challenging for the smaller owner/operator. The traditionally historic advantage of the smaller operator’s ability to offer relationship-driven customized services is no longer totally sufficient for sustainable growth – especially with the increasing regulatory challenges of the Affordable Care Act, federal and state minimum wage laws, Family Medical Leave Act and state laws (i.e. meal and rest break reporting and now, predictive scheduling).
 
Even stronger local and smaller regional companies are finding it more difficult to protect their client base and grow revenues under increasing regulatory as well as competitive pressures. Larger regional and national organizations are dealing with the regulatory climate while growing market share by leveraging infrastructure, technology, economies of scale with more aggressive pricing and better service reliability. This approach appears to offer a more compelling value proposition from the client’s perspective, which seems evident by the higher client retention rates reported by the major security companies.
 
However, this consolidating trend may not be inevitable for the future as newer, more tech-savvy owner/operators enter the business and recognize how to adopt best practices with a variety of sophisticated third-party software platforms and applications to help level the playing field. These include talent management and on-boarding applications to attract, hire and maintain a more skilled and reliable workforce; integrated labor management platforms to control scheduling, compliance, operations, payroll, billing and financial reporting; and state-of-the-art social media marketing applications.

The contract security industry should now be able to more effectively capitalize on and penetrate opportunities in a $20 billion in-house market – especially for those companies who have invested and integrated technology into a more highly reliable ecosystem of protective services.
 
For the foreseeable future, the U.S. manned guarding business seems likely for continued sustainable growth. While the technology/manpower ratio may shift the revenue mix going forward, based on today’s currently expanding U.S. economy, the prospects for an aggregate growth rate of four percent or more seem realistic and perhaps even conservative, especially for ownership who have prudently invested in technology enhancements to their core guarding operations.
 
Providing these strategies can yield an attractive ROI, increase operating profits (EBITDA ranges of four to six percent and higher) and enterprise valuations, this industry seems not only viable but also opportune for further investment consideration.
