 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Prior to July 11, 2022, we were a blank check company registered under the laws of the Cayman Islands and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On July 11, 2022, we completed the Business Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated January 18, 2022, that we entered into with PKLP. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, we changed our name to “ProKidney Corp.” and the business of PKLP became our business.
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a transformative proprietary cell therapy platform capable of treating multiple chronic kidney diseases using a patient’s own cells isolated from the patient intended for treatment. Our approach seeks to redefine the treatment of chronic kidney disease (“CKD”), shifting the emphasis away from management of kidney failure to the restoration or improvement of kidney function to stop or delay progression of CKD. Our lead product candidate, which we refer to as REACT®, is designed to preserve kidney function in a CKD patient’s diseased kidneys. REACT is a product that includes autologous Selected Renal Cells (“SRCs”) prepared from a patient’s own (autologous) kidney cells. SRCs are formulated into a product for reinjection into the patient’s kidney using a minimally invasive outpatient procedure that might be repeatable, if necessary. Because REACT is a personalized treatment composed of cells prepared from a patient’s own kidney, there is no need for treatment with immunosuppressive therapies that are required during a patient’s lifetime when a patient receives a kidney transplant from another (allogeneic) donor.
 Currently available therapies have limited ability to address the root causes of diabetic CKD, and patients continue to decline in kidney function even after receiving standard of care therapy.
We are currently conducting a global Phase 3 development program and multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for REACT in subjects with moderate to severe diabetic kidney disease. We are also conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial for REACT in subjects with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (“CAKUT”) for which the last subject visit occurred in January 2023. REACT has been generally well tolerated by subjects with moderate to severe diabetic kidney disease in Phase 1 and 2 clinical testing to date. It has also been shown, based on measurements of iohexol renal clearance, to preserve kidney function in some study subjects. REACT has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation from the FDA.
 Our patented technology includes multiple breakthroughs in the manufacturing and medical delivery of cellular therapy products. While it has long been accepted that the body contains cells with regenerative power, our technology enables the preparation of key progenitor cells, or SRCs, made by expanding a patient’s own kidney cells, that can be reinjected into the same patient in an attempt to restore kidney function lost due to chronic diseases. Our process begins when a small biopsy of a patient’s diseased kidney is sent to our current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) manufacturing facility. We are able to process cells taken from the biopsy and select specific cells with a regenerative capacity. These selected renal cells, SRCs, are formulated into a personalized product for reinjection into the damaged kidney(s). To date, clinical studies suggest that REACT has the capacity to, for a time, positively impact kidney function as reflected by stabilizing the estimated glomerular filtration rate (“eGFR”) or attenuating the rate of eGFR decline in patients with type 2 diabetic CKD. Other improvements observed with REACT treatment include increased kidney cortical thickness and improved hemoglobin levels; reduced hemoglobin levels are a marker of anemia.
 We are initially pursuing the development of REACT for use in moderate to severe CKD patients in the United States with diabetes as the primary cause and may include hypertension as a potential label expansion indication. We estimate that approximately 38-39 million adults, representing approximately 15% of the U.S. adult population, currently suffer from CKD. Chronic Kidney Disease is segmented into five CKD stages, from mild (CKD 1) to severe (CKD5 or kidney failure). With respect to those patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD caused primarily by diabetes, we estimate that approximately 4-5 million patients could be eligible to be treated with REACT.
 We currently operate a manufacturing facility that has been designed to comply with FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) quality standards and to produce REACT treatments from biopsied material. This facility, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in the United States, has a potential capacity sufficient to supply our global Phase 3 program as well as the first stage of a potential commercial launch, should REACT ever receive regulatory approval.


Our Pipeline
 We are leveraging our cell therapy technology to develop product candidates designed to stop or delay kidney failure in CKD from diabetes and CAKUT. The following table summarizes our current pipeline:
    The Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) injection is an investigational therapy that is a mixture of kidney cells prepared from the participant’s own kidney tissue. The initial kidney tissue is obtained from two small pieces of kidney tissue obtained by a standard kidney biopsy performed by a specially trained physician. From this tissue, certain kidney cells, which are thought to be important for healing the kidney, are grown and multiplied in a highly specialized laboratory facility. After several weeks, when sufficient cells are available, the REACT preparation of cells is sent back to the clinical trial site where it can be re-injected directly into the participant’s own kidneys. It is believed that these selected and prepared cells may help a diseased kidney stabilize or improve over time, and thereby potentially delay the need for dialysis or transplantation by preserving kidney function.
 Clinical studies suggest that REACT can impact kidney function positively by stabilizing eGFR, or attenuating the rate of eGFR decline, in type 2 diabetic CKD patients. We have developed a cryopreserved version of REACT that allows for long-term product preservation to be used in our Phase 3 trials of REACT (called REGEN-006 and REGEN-016), our Phase 2 trial of REACT (called REGEN-007) and our Phase 1 trial of REACT (called REGEN-015), treating diabetes patients with CKD. In addition to the cryopreserved formulation of REACT, we used a gelatin-based hydrogel formulation in our Phase 2 trials (called RMCL-002 and REGEN-003) and Phase 1 trial in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (“CAKUT”) (called REGEN-004). The cryopreserved version of REACT allows for preparation of 5-10 doses from a single biopsy sample. We have two preclinical programs (called REACT/Gen and REACT/Universal) where we plan to use genetically modified bioactive kidney cell populations to provide regenerative effects to a diseased kidney. The preclinical programs seek to obtain “universal donor” cell populations where gene editing is used to generate novel kidney cell populations that do not generate an immune response.
 Our Team and Corporate History
 We have an experienced internal research and development team focused on utilizing our deep understanding of kidney disease pathways to discover and develop novel cell-based therapies with a multi-modal mechanism targeting various pathways. Since our founding, we have expanded our team to incorporate additional expertise as needed to pursue our goal of becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. We have assembled key management team members with expertise in kidney disease, cell therapy, development, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, operations, quality, and manufacturing. Our Chief Executive Officer, Tim Bertram, has more than 38 years of pharmaceutical development expertise and has led innovations in cellular therapeutics for over 18 years. Our Chief Operating Officer, Deepak Jain, Ph.D., has over 36 years of experience in the development of biologics, tissue engineered and cell therapy products.
Our Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary, Todd Girolamo, has more than 30 years’ experience in legal practice and public finance, including 12 years in cell therapy development and 12 years as a series 24, 7 and 63 licensed principal specializing in equity research, sales, and trading of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology market sectors. Chief Financial Officer James Coulston has 15 years of biotech financial management experience.

Our technology is being developed based on work that has been conducted for the past 20 years at different institutions. Founder and CEO Tim Bertram noted when he was working on kidney disease therapies that healthy, young patients suffering from acute kidney injury demonstrated the ability to rejuvenate and repair their injured kidneys, while patients with chronic, diabetic CKD demonstrated continued decline in kidney function. Intrigued by this, Dr. Bertram and his team endeavored to isolate the cell types occurring naturally in the kidney that are responsible for repair of kidney function. This work continued through various institutions to become REACT at ProKidney today.
 ProKidney LLC, formerly, a wholly owned subsidiary of PKLP (“ProKidney Bermuda”) was formed in December 2018 as a Bermuda limited liability company and was founded by a group of investors in the pharmaceutical industry.
ProKidney (formerly known as RegenMed (Cayman) Ltd. (d/b/a inRegen)) (“ProKidney-KY”) was duly incorporated under the Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (the “Cayman Islands Companies Act”) on December 21, 2015, as an exempted company. In 2020, ProKidney-KY’s name was changed from RegenMed (Cayman) Ltd. to ProKidney. ProKidney, LLC (formerly known as Twin City Bio LLC) (“ProKidney-US”) changed its name from Twin City Bio LLC to ProKidney, LLC. ProKidney-US is a Delaware limited liability company formed on December 18, 2015. In January 2019, ProKidney Bermuda acquired all of the equity interests in ProKidney-KY and ProKidney-US.
ProKidney Bermuda acquired the equity interests in ProKidney-KY to develop its renal advanced cell therapy, which has the potential to preserve kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease or delay or eliminate the need for dialysis and organ transplantation. ProKidney Bermuda acquired ProKidney-US to provide contractual development and manufacturing services to ProKidney-KY, which is ProKidney-US’s only customer.
 On August 5, 2021, PKLP was organized as a limited partnership under the Limited Partnerships Act, 1907 of Ireland (the “Irish LP Act”), and, as applicable, the Partnership Act 1890, of Ireland, with ProKidney Bermuda becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of PKLP. In September 2021, ProKidney Bermuda distributed its equity interests in ProKidney-KY and ProKidney-USto PKLP with the effect that ProKidney-KY and ProKidney-US became direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of PKLP. ProKidneyBermuda was dissolved in October of 2022.
 References to “ProKidney” or the “Company” generally refer to PKLP after its reorganization and to ProKidney Corp. following the Closing.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company pioneering treatments for CKD. Key components of our business strategy include the following:
 

 | Obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize REACT, initially as a treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease caused by diabetes. We intend to continue to pursue the clinical development of REACT through a world-wide Phase 3 clinical development program that has been reviewed by both the EMA and the FDA. We activated the first site for our first Phase 3 clinical trial, REGEN-006 (which we also call “proact 1”), in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the first Informed Consent Form signed and the first subject randomized into the trial in the first quarter of 2022. Our second Phase 3 trial, REGEN-016 (which we also call “proact 2”), received regulatory allowance to begin enrollment of patients in Spain during the first quarter of 2023, with additional country allowances and site activations expected throughout 2023. Enrollment for REGEN-016 is anticipated to begin in the second quarter of 2023. A long-term follow-up trial, REGEN-008, is expected to launch in late 2023, for subjects who received REACT as part of our trials.


 | Expand the clinical development of REACT for the treatment of additional indications, including CKD caused by Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract and hypertension. CAKUT is the cause of more than 50% of pediatric cases of kidney failure, with long-term complications of CKD which may progress into adulthood. REGEN-004 was a Phase 1 clinical trial that was designed to assess in five patients the ability of REACT to prevent, stop, or delay the negative effects of CAKUT. We completed the last visit for the last patient in January 2023 and expect to have a clinical study report by the end of the third quarter of 2023. Hypertension related CKD is the second most common cause of CKD in adults. Future trials may address CKD in CAKUT and hypertensive populations. 


 | Discover and develop additional product candidates for the treatment of kidney diseases utilizing our cell therapy approach. Our team has extensive experience in discovery research, deep expertise in kidney disease and a strong record of publication in high-impact peer reviewed journals. While executing on its primary mission to develop and commercialize REACT our team will investigate additional disease pathways associated with kidney disease, identify key targets for intervention and generate product candidates against these targets. We may also in-license from or collaborate with third parties to develop product candidates that we, based on our understanding of kidney diseases and pathways, believe are promising therapeutics.


 | Maintain and continually refine our sophisticated internal expertise in manufacturing our products. We have developed and built a cGMP manufacturing facility in which we manufacture REACT for clinical trials and intend to continue to develop for purposes of the eventual commercial manufacturing process, assuming receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Our current cGMP manufacturing facility is capable of manufacturing product for our Phase 3 clinical trials and could serve as our commercial launch facility. We anticipate construction of automated manufacturing facilities to meet demand for REACT upon commercialization.

Kidney Disease Overview
 CKD is highly prevalent in the United States and European Union. Based on available U.S. data from the 2018 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, we expect the aggregate CKD population in the United States and European Union to reach approximately 74.4 million in 2020, approximately 82.2 million in 2030 and approximately 90.9 million in 2040. The most common causes of CKD among adults are diabetes, hypertension, and glomerular disease, and in the pediatric population, CAKUT. In the United States, it is believed that approximately 18 million patients per year suffer from stage 3 or 4 CKD.
Our Approach: Working to Restore Kidney Function through Autologous Cell Therapy
 Autologous cell therapy refers to the prevention or treatment of human disease by the administration of a person’s own cells that have been selected, multiplied and formulated for delivery outside the body. We believe that our technology has the potential to restore kidney function by using a patient’s own SRCs to restore natural healing processes. By contrast, organ transplantation from other donors, or allogeneic transplants, can be associated with surgical complications, organ rejection and failure. Further, organ transplantation patients live with the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapies and ongoing therapeutic maintenance that are required in order to reduce the risk of rejection of transplanted organs.
 Preparing the personalized renal autologous cell therapy (REACT) begins when a small biopsy of the diseased kidney is sent to our laboratory. We are able to identify the patient’s own healthy progenitor cells and formulate them into a personalized product that can be re-injected into the damaged kidney for repair and restoration of function. Due to one severe bleed that occurred during an early REACT injection procedure, we changed to a noncutting needle design for the REACT procedure. Based on preclinical studies, when the manufactured REACT product is injected into the diseased kidney, the product’s progenitor cells rapidly distribute throughout the kidney and integrate into the damaged nephrons and interstitium. To date, clinical studies suggest that treatment with REACT in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD may positively impact kidney function by stabilizing eGFR or attenuating the rate of eGFR decline. Other improvements observed with preclinical and clinical REACT treatment include metabolic, as well as filtration benefits, stabilization and/or reduction in UACR, increased kidney cortical thickness, and improved hemoglobin levels, improvements in calcium phosphate and vitamin D3.
 REACT is an autologous homologous cell admixture made from expanded autologous SRCs, obtained from each individual subject’s kidney biopsy tissue. To manufacture REACT, biopsy tissue from each enrolled subject is sent to ProKidney’s facilities where the kidney cells are expanded and SRCs selected. SRCs are formulated into a cryopreserved product at a concentration of approximately 100 x 106 cells/mL and shipped frozen to the clinical site.
 



Mechanism of Action of REACT
 Engraftment of SRCs is believed to provide the molecular and mechanistic basis for activation of endogenous renal repair mechanisms that are still active in the chronically diseased kidney. Non-clinical studies in multiple animal models of CKD have demonstrated that SRCs injected directly into the kidney cortex were capable of effecting a regenerative response in multiple locations of the nephron through direct engraftment or tissue replacement and through a putative paracrine mechanism involving the effect of secreted factors. In animal models of CKD, treatment with SRCs preserved kidney function, reduced proteinuria and provided a significant survival benefit. Additionally, there is evidence both from preclinical models and early findings from clinical studies that demonstrate that injected SRCs may augment other important kidney functions related to bone and mineral metabolism and hematopoiesis. Observations supporting this include trends toward decreasing phosphorus and increasing hemoglobin levels. In animal models of CKD, SRCs have been shown to minimize the development of osteoclastic bone resorption, which is characteristically due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, and improve cellularity in marrow related to red blood cell production.
Our Product Candidates
 REACT is currently in a Phase 3 development program, as well as ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, for the treatment of moderate to severe diabetic kidney disease and a Phase 1 clinical trial for REACT in patients with CAKUT. These trials are being, or will be conducted, at over 150 clinical sites throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. REACT has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials to date involving patients with moderate to severe diabetic kidney disease. For example, in the RMCL-002 Phase 2 clinical trial, the interim analysis as of September 2021 demonstrates there is a statistically significant improvement in a measurement of kidney function, referred to as eGFR, between treatment arms in the trial, measured at six months after the second injection of REACT (p-value=0.03), nine months after the second injection of REACT (p-value=0.018), and 12 months after the second injection of REACT (p-value=0.02).
  The ongoing clinical development program utilizes a percutaneous injection method into the kidney that is conducted using conscious sedation in an outpatient same-day procedure. As of December 31, 2022, over 200 patients were enrolled in our clinical trials and had received a first injection of REACT with more than 120 patients having received a second injection. The procedure appears to be generally well tolerated with the most commonly observed procedure related events including nausea, vomiting, fever, and hematuria with biopsy. In the RMCL-002 trial, which used a different formulation of the REACT product and a different procedure than that presently used in our Phase 3 trials, one participant experienced serious adverse events that included scarring or fibrosis and a decrease in kidney function. A second participant experienced decreased kidney blood flow observed on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (“CT”) imaging and a decrease in kidney function. Serious adverse events, including injection-related pain, kidney-related events such as hematoma, renal vascular events, eGFR decline and acute kidney injury, have also been reported. Other serious adverse events, including acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, end stage renal disease, and coronary artery disease have been reported and are generally associated with the co-morbidities of patients with Type 2 diabetes. We cannot assure that the improvements in eGFR that we have observed in the March 2022 interim analysis of our RMCL-002 Phase 2 clinical trial will be observed in any future clinical trials. Likewise, promising results in interim analyses or other preliminary analyses may not ensure that the clinical trial as a whole will be successful.


Background and Unmet Need
 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
 CKD is characterized by progressive disease that, without therapeutic intervention, will worsen until the subject reaches end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”). CKD patients suffer from reduced kidney function, demonstrated by decreased eGFR, or evidence of kidney damage, such as increased excretion of urinary albumin as shown in physician office laboratory testing. The global prevalence of CKD is estimated at 10% with ranges of 8-16% in various high populations. CKD is associated with considerable morbidity, such as diabetes mellitus, and is often accompanied by adverse outcomes due to underlying disease states and/or risk factors such as renovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes, causing an increased risk of mortality. Ninety-seven percent of patients with moderate to severe CKD have asymptomatic disease, but even this stage of CKD is associated with a two-to four-fold rise in cardiovascular disease risk, along with a significant increase in all-cause mortality. Only a small proportion of CKD patients progress to ESRD (i.e., Stage 5 disease), but the increasing life expectancy of humans has led to growing numbers of patients with chronic diseases and end-stage organ failure. Even with costly treatments, subjects with ESRD experience substantial morbidity and mortality. To survive, ESRD subjects require renal replacement therapy with peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Preventing or delaying the onset of adverse outcomes of CKD via early intervention is the primary strategy for CKD management. Nevertheless, early treatments have been less than optimal, resulting in a significant unmet medical need for improved interventional strategies to manage CKD and delay the regression to ESRD.
 The major causes of CKD in adults are diabetes and hypertension. Nearly half of all CKD cases arise from diabetes, with or without hypertension. The incidence of CKD continues to increase, primarily due to the increased worldwide incidence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Staging and grading of kidney function are most often quantified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (or eGFR), which is defined as the volume of plasma from which a given substance is completely cleared by glomerular filtration per unit time. KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease provided guidelines intended to aid general practitioners and nephrologists in the evaluation, classification, and management of CKD in both adults and children. As set forth below, Figure 1 categorizes the risk of ESRD from “low” to “very high” based on both eGFR measurements, ranging from >90 mL/min/1.73m2 to <30 mL/min/1.73m2, and albuminuria classifications ranging from <30 mg/g to >300 mg/g. When the kidneys cease to function entirely, which constitutes ESRD, renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation is generally required.
 Summary of Classification Estimates for CKD
 


All-cause mortality rates were shown to increase progressively as GFR declined. Populations defined as having an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 consistently exhibited a higher mortality rate than comparator groups where there was no evidence of CKD.
 Treatment of patients with CKD is focused on slowing progression and preparing for kidney failure or replacement. For many patients, CKD occurs as part of a complex comorbidity cluster including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
 Increased risk of cardiovascular disease can be a complication of CKD or an independent comorbidity associated with type 2 diabetes. The goals in the treatment of CKD are to lower cardiovascular risk and prevent or slow the progression of kidney failure

via administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers to decrease proteinuria and control hypertension, insulin and anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control (e.g., reduced serum hemoglobin A1c), and statin therapy to counter dyslipidemia.
 When a patient reaches ESRD, renal replacement therapy in the form of kidney dialysis or transplantation is generally required. The vast majority of Stage 5 CKD patients in the United States and certain other developed countries receive hemodialysis. Dialysis replaces about 5-15% of kidney function, depending on the intensity and frequency of use; dialysis also helps to restore fluid and electrolyte balance when kidneys fail. However, the life expectancy of an ESRD patient initiating hemodialysis is < 10 years. Additionally, hemodialysis has been associated with multiple, serious complications as well as interference with quality of life, due to the need for frequent dialysis and vascular access maintenance. Although kidney transplantation remains the most effective form of therapy for CKD currently, there is a chronic shortage of organs. If a patient can secure a kidney for transplantation, long-term immunosuppressive therapy is required to prevent rejection. Use of these regimens results in a higher incidence of infection and, over the long term, some types of cancer. And while xenotransplantation might be a promising alternative approach in the future to bridge the gap between the supply and demand of human organs, tissues, and cells, immunological barriers are limiting factors in clinical xenotransplantation at the current time.
 While patients continue to lose kidney function on existing therapies, the cost of CKD treatment is high and the rates of CKD and ESRD, along with the associated expenditures, are expected to continue to rise. As a major source of healthcare expenditure in the United States, the Medicare spend on beneficiaries with CKD is approximately $80 billion. Medicare spend on beneficiaries with ESRD can reach an additional $50 billion, with an estimated $93,000 Medicare annual cost per patient for dialysis. Additionally, the estimated ESRD cost per patient with commercial insurance, assuming a five-year dialysis period, is up to $2 million.

Clinical Development
 Our completed clinical trials and currently ongoing clinical trials of REACT are summarized below; the name of the product candidate tested in the trials was changed from Neo-Kidney Augment (“NKA”) to REACT after completion of some of the trials.
 The summary below also includes interim results which are based on a preliminary analysis of then- available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular trial. In particular, we have announced interim results from our ongoing RMCL-002 Phase 2 clinical trial. We expect that final results from our completed REGEN-003 Phase 2 clinical trial and REGEN-004 Phase 1 clinical trial will be available in late 2023. We also plan to evaluate interim results from our ongoing REGEN-006 Phase 3 clinical trial in early 2025 and REGEN-016 Phase 3 clinical trial in late 2025. Interim results from clinical trials that we may complete are not necessarily indicative of

results from future data and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or topline results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
 Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)
 Phase 1 Clinical Development (TNG-CL010 and TNG-CL011)
 TNG-CL010 was an open-label safety and delivery optimization study of REACT (formerly known as NKA) in subjects with CKD conducted in Sweden.TNG-CL010 commenced in April 2013 and completed in December 2014. TNG-CL011 was also an open-label safety and delivery optimization study of REACT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD conducted in the United States. TNG-CL011 commenced with first subject enrolled in February 2014 and completed in December 2014.
 The primary objective of these trials was to assess the safety and delivery of REACT injected into one kidney. Six subjects from Sweden (TNG-CL010) and one from the United States with Diabetes Type 2 CKD, ranging in age from 53-70 years, eGFR levels between 19-34 (average 25 +/- 2, Cystatin C) and iohexol clearance of 15-39, average 26 +/- 3, were enrolled. One subject with Type 2 DKD was enrolled in TNG-CL011.
 The results from the Phase 1 trials indicated that REACT was well tolerated when administered to the kidney, with no adverse events from the autologous SRCs. When the decline of kidney function pre-and post- injection were compared, the subjects receiving REACT in this Phase 1 trial had an imputed delay in dialysis of approximately 1.5 years beyond the standard of care due to a reduced rate of reduction in eGFR from pre-injection baseline. Cortical thickness increased in the injected kidney from an average of 14 mm at time of injection to approximately 16 mm after one year. Kidney function was preserved following the REACT injection by iohexol clearance and based on the subjects’ ACRs. Subjects with a baseline anemia (n = 3 of 7) showed improved hemoglobin levels after REACT injection, and the remaining subjects maintained normal levels during the study. Antihypertensive medication was reduced in three of six subjects during the first six months following injection with REACT.
 The data from TNG-CL011 were accepted by FDA as part of a clinical data package submitted to progress to Phase 2.
 Phase 2 Clinical Development (RMCL-001, RMCL-002, REGEN-003, and REGEN-007)
RMCL-001:
 RMCL-001 was a Phase 2, open-label safety and efficacy study of REACT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The study commenced in May 2016 and was ended in May 2017.
 The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a second REACT injection using a minimally invasive percutaneous procedure that was done under conscious sedation as a same-day outpatient procedure. A single subject with an eGFR of 14ml/min/1.73m2 was enrolled from the Phase 1 study (TNG-CL011) described above. The second dose of REACT was manufactured from cryopreserved kidney cells obtained from the Phase 1 kidney biopsy. The subject was administered a dose of 3x106 cells/g-KWest. The subject’s eGFR increased to approximately 20 ml/min/1.73m2 for a period of eight months, after which the subject experienced a precipitous drop in kidney function and began hemodialysis. The study was terminated by the sponsor of the clinical trial after this subject went onto dialysis and resources diverted to study RMCL-002.
 RMCL-002:
 RMCL-002 is an ongoing Phase 2, prospective, randomized, double-arm, deferred treatment, open-label, repeat dose, safety and efficacy study of REACT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The first subject was enrolled in this study in February 2017, and subjects are now undergoing follow-up.
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of up to two REACT injections given six months (up to four weeks after target date) apart in Type 2 Diabetic Disease patients with eGFRs between 20 and 50 ml/min/1.73m2, with both doses delivered into the biopsied kidney using an outpatient, minimally invasive, percutaneous approach under conscious sedation in less than 90 minutes. Patients received two doses of REACT of 3x106 cells/g-KWest.
 Patients were randomized (1:1) to the active treatment group and the deferred treatment group (i.e., the control group) following kidney biopsy. Subjects in the active treatment group receive their first REACT injection as soon as the REACT product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site. After six months (up to four weeks after target date), a second injection was given, as appropriate. In contrast, subjects in the deferred treatment group will undergo a 12-month period of observation after kidney biopsy. The deferred treatment group allows assessment of the rate of change in kidney function and co-morbidities in a nonexposed group compared to the active treated arm. During this time, they received contemporaneous, standard-of-care therapy for CKD while undergoing follow-up evaluations every three months, similar to subjects in the active treatment group. After 12 months, subjects from the deferred treatment group received a series of up to two REACT injections given six months (+/- four

weeks of the target date) apart, as appropriate. Consequently, the study design includes a randomized control group receiving standard-of-care treatment for the first 12 months and a randomized, active treatment group receiving up to two REACT injections and follow-up evaluations during the same period of time. In addition, each subject’s baseline rate of kidney decline, based on adequate historical and clinical data obtained 18 months prior to REACT injection, will serve as a comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of kidney insufficiency over time.
 The aggregate number of subjects enrolled for the Phase 2 clinical trial was 83. Upon withdrawal and/or replacement of 2 subjects, 81 subjects were enrolled as of December 2020, of which 41 subjects were enrolled into the active treatment group and 42 subjects were enrolled into the deferred treatment group. As of December 31, 2022, 39 subjects enrolled in the active group had received their first injection, and 34 received their second. No further injections will occur in the active group. Thirty-four subjects in the deferred group have crossed over into the active group, with 34 subjects having received their first injection and 26 having received their second injection as of December 31, 2022.
 The rate of progression of kidney function for the active treatment group, assessed via pre-randomized serial measurements of eGFR over 24 months after the last REACT injection, will be compared against that of the deferred treatment group. In addition, each subject’s baseline rate of eGFR decline, derived from historical and clinical data, will be compared against the individual subject’s rate of eGFR decline through 24 months following the final REACT injection. The rate of progression of kidney function of subjects, if any, who received a single REACT injection may be compared against that of subjects who received two REACT injections. Patients will be followed for 24 months after their last REACT injection in part 1 of the trial. An open label extension portion of the study (part 2) was added in February 2021 to follow all subjects for an additional 3 years. Visits will be conducted at 3-month intervals to give a total of 5 years (part 1 + part 2) of follow-up after the last REACT injection.
 Subjects in this trial will complete the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (“KDQOL”) survey, which is a subjective kidney-specific measure of health-related quality of life, and the EQ-5D-5L survey, which is a health- related quality of life questionnaire. Scores from the active treatment group will be compared against scores from the deferred treatment group. Subjects from the deferred treatment group will comprise the control group for the analysis of KDQOL scores. In addition, each subject’s baseline score will be compared against his or her KDQOL scores obtained over the 24-month period after the last REACT injection. KDQOL scores from subjects who received a single REACT injection may be compared against scores from subjects who received two injections.
 Results as of the March 2022 interim analysis demonstrate that kidney function has been preserved in the subjects who have received a full course (2 injections) of REACT and has steadily declined in the deferred treatment group. The overall mean total slope for the active treatment group is a positive (+5.0 ml/ min/1.73m2/year), whereas the overall mean total slope for the deferred treatment group is a decline (-3.9ml/ min/1.73m2/year). This shows an effect difference of +8.9 ml/min/1.73m2/year in annualized change in kidney function between the active treatment group and the deferred treatment group. Each slope is calculated using a simple linear regression between the average eGFR measurements on the first injection day and three, six, nine and 12 months following the last injection day, where the averages are assumed to be equally spaced.
 The interim analysis as of March 2022 demonstrates there is a statistically significant difference in the average eGFR between treatment arms (subjects who received a full course of REACT compared to the standard of care) at six months post 2nd injection (p-value=0.032), nine months post second injection (p-value=0.02) and 12 months post second injection (p-value=0.02).The kidney biopsy and REACT injections are conducted as outpatient procedures and have been generally well tolerated by patients. In the RMCL-002 trial, which used a different formulation of the REACT product and a different procedure than that presently used in our Phase 3 trials, one participant experienced serious adverse events that included scarring or fibrosis and a decrease in kidney function. A second participant experienced decreased kidney blood flow observed on contract-enhanced computerized tomography (“CT”) imaging and a decrease in kidney function. As of March 2023, serious renal-linked adverse events were observed in 4 of 83 participants in the RMCL-002 trial and included hematoma, acute kidney injury, blood transfusion, CKD progression, renal vascular event, cortical scarring, and pain. Other adverse events reported have been commonly associated with the co-morbidities of Type 2 diabetes and similar to those seen in other small molecule CKD trials.
 We have dosed all deferred subjects in 2022 and are on track to obtain additional interim data and complete all follow-up visits for all active subjects in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also plan to complete all follow-up visits for deferred subjects by early 2024 and deliver the clinical study report by early 2025. Results from interim data may not be indicative of results from future data.
 REGEN-003:
 REGEN-003 is a Phase 2, prospective open-label, single-arm, safety and tolerability study of REACT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD, specifically those with high-risk late Stage 4 DKD. This study commenced in March 2018, at which time the first subject was enrolled. The early results were published online in January 2023 in the Journal of Blood Purification in a manuscript entitled, “Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) in Type 2 Diabetes with Late Stage 4 Diabetes-Related Chronic Kidney Disease: Trial Design and Early Analysis” (DOI: doi.org/10.1159/000527582).


The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of up to two REACT injections given six months (up to four weeks after target date) apart in Type 2 Diabetic Kidney Disease patients with eGFRs between 14 and 20 ml/min/1.73m2 and delivered into the biopsied kidney using a minimally invasive percutaneous approach that can be delivered under conscious sedation in less than 90 minutes. Subjects have an eGFR of between 14—20 ml/min/1.73m2. Subjects receive up to two doses of REACT of 3x106 cells/g-KWest.
 This study enrolled a total of ten adults (5 men and 5 women) with CKD resulting from type 2 DKD (kidney function measured by eGFR of 14-20 ml/min/1.73 m²). Following a percutaneous kidney biopsy and ex vivo expansion of Selected Renal Cells (SRCs) that form REACT, the REACT product was injected into the cortex of the biopsied kidney with CT image guidance. Nine participants received two doses of the REACT product at 6-month intervals; one participant received only one injection. A 6-month observation pre-trial was required to establish patients’ “own” baseline and rate of DKD progression. As of March 2023, there were no cell product-related serious adverse events reported. Serious renal-linked adverse events related to the REACT procedure were reported in three participants, including acute kidney injury, CKD progression, renal arteriovenous fistula and hematomas which required observation without transfusion or angiographic interventions. At the time of this analysis, dialysis was delayed a mean of 16 months (range 6-28 months). At 15 months, two patients (20%) had preservation of their kidney function and had not advanced to renal replacement therapy. One patient died due to complications related to COVID, and an additional subject died due to a myocardial infarction approximately 18 months after enrollment. The results from this study suggest that REACT has the potential to delay dialysis in high-risk Stage 4 and Stage 5 DKD patients.
 REGEN-007:
 REGEN-007 is an ongoing Phase 2, prospective, randomized, open-label, repeat dose, double-arm, controlled safety and efficacy study of REACT in subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes and CKD.
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of up to two REACT injections given three months apart (up to 60 days after target date) in Type 1 and 2 Diabetic Kidney Disease with eGFRs between 20 and 50 ml/min/1.73m2) and delivered into biopsied and non-biopsied contralateral kidneys using a minimally invasive percutaneous approach, as compared to a single REACT injection followed by monitoring and a potential second injection delivered into the non-biopsied contralateral kidney using a minimally invasive percutaneous approach triggered by a 20% decrease in eGFR and/or a 30% increase in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (“UACR”), that is delivered within 60 days of trigger being met. In previous Phase 2 studies, we injected REACT into the same kidney twice. Based on a generally favorable safety profile observed in previous studies, we are now proceeding with the injection of REACT into both kidneys in REGEN-007, which we expect will result in increased therapeutic effect as compared to injecting a single kidney, as the systemic effects of Type-2 diabetes mellitus impact both kidneys. By injecting both kidneys, patients have maximal exposure to REACT cells, with the potential to impact a greater proportion of kidney mass. Further, the number of glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidney) that are amenable to regenerative therapy is effectively doubled when injecting both kidneys, thereby allowing both kidneys to initiate healing and repair to improve function. The main goal of REGEN-007 is to evaluate whether REACT injections in both kidneys as opposed to two injections in the same kidney will: (a) increase the improvement of kidney function over and above the mean eGFR improvement observed in REGEN-002, or (b) increase the number of patients in which kidney function is preserved as compared to the number of patients in which this was observed in REGEN-002.
 Subjects will receive up to two doses of REACT of 3x106 cells/g-KWest. The study will enroll subjects between the ages of 30 and 80 with an eGFR >20 and ≤50 mL/min/1.73m2. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) before kidney biopsy into two cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive the two REACT injections three months apart. Cohort 2 will receive the first REACT injection, and a trigger, as described below, must be met to qualify for the second REACT injection more than three months after the first dose. This will allow a comparison of the effects of a specified amount of time between dosing, as compared to a biologic trigger between dosing.
 Each of the subjects in cohort 1 will receive the first REACT injection as soon as the REACT product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site. After three months, subjects will receive a second injection, as appropriate. Subjects in cohort 2 will also receive one REACT injection as soon as the REACT product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site. For cohort 2, a second REACT injection will only be administered if a subject meets one or more clinical surrogate marker criteria. The second REACT injection will be administered to subjects in cohort 2 no less than three months after the first injection, within 30 days (up to four weeks after target date) of meeting the re-dose trigger. The re-dose triggers include (1) a 30-day sustained decline in eGFR by at least 20% from baseline and (2) an increase in the baseline UACR of at least 30% greater than 30mg/gram, measured 30 days after the baseline measurement is taken. For all subjects who receive a second injection, the second injection will be administered in the non-biopsied contralateral kidney.
 During this time, subjects in cohort 2 will receive contemporaneous, standard-of-care therapy for CKD while undergoing follow-up evaluations at one, 14 (up to 7 days after target date) and 28 days (up to 7 days after target date) following the first injection, and then at three months (up to 10 days after target date) following the first injection, similar to subjects in cohort 1. All subjects will continue with long-term follow-up visits at three- month intervals for a period of 18 months following the last injection. In addition, each subject’s baseline rate of kidney decline, based on adequate historical, clinical data obtained 24 months

prior to the first REACT injection, will serve as a comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of renal insufficiency over time. The primary efficacy endpoint of REGEN-007 is improvement in the rate of kidney function decline as indicated by the change from pre-injection baseline value in total (acute + chronic) slope of eGFR over 18 months. The primary safety endpoint is treatment-emergent adverse events through 18 months following the last REACT injection. REGEN-007 is an unblinded study in which cohort 1 patients will receive the same treatment regimen as the patients in our Phase 3 program that are randomized to the active arms.
 We believe that REGEN-007 may provide some insights regarding the magnitude of clinical benefit that could be observed in our Phase 3 program.
 We commenced enrollment for REGEN-007 in the third quarter of 2021 and expanded target enrollment from 30 to up to 50 subjects as a result of strong investigator interest. As of December 31, 2022, 35 subjects were enrolled with 18 subjects randomized to cohort 1 and 17 subjects randomized to cohort 2. As of that date, 13 subjects in cohort 1 had received their first dose of REACT, seven of whom received a second dose into the contralateral kidney, and 12 subjects in cohort 2 received their first dose of REACT, with one subject having met a re-dose trigger receiving a second injection in the contralateral kidney. As of March 2023, serious renal-linked adverse events related to the REACT procedure were observed in 4 out of 39 participants, including hematomas, transfusion, acute kidney injury, and hematuria with the biopsy.
 We anticipate reporting interim data from this study from a limited number of patients in the second half of 2023.
 Phase 3 Clinical Development: proact 1 and proact 2 (REGEN-006 and REGEN-016):
 We applied for RMAT designation for REACT, which was granted by the FDA on October 28, 2021. As contemplated by the RMAT designation and as directed by the FDA, we requested a comprehensive, multidisciplinary Type B meeting with the FDA to review the status of preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing of REACT, and to discuss the planned clinical program intended to support approval of the product candidate. The FDA provided detailed written responses to our questions included in the meeting request, and the Type B meeting was held in March 2022. As a result of that meeting, we made some modifications to the Phase 3 trial designs and endpoints, including the following:
 

 | increased the planned sample size from 500 to 600 subjects in both REGEN-006 and REGEN-016;


 | removed the increase in UACR of at least 30% and of at least 30 mg/g, using the random urine microalbumin/urine creatinine ratio sustained for 90 days, from the primary composite endpoint for both REGEN-006 and REGEN-016;


 | added a sham control arm and single blind component to the design of REGEN-016 and composite time-to-event composed of:


 | at least 40% reduction in eGFR, using the 2009 CKD-EPI serum creatinine equation, sustained for 30 days;


 | eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m² using the 2009 CKD-EPI serum creatinine equation, sustained for 30 days and/or chronic dialysis, and/or renal transplant; or


 | renal or cardiovascular death.

 We will continue to advance the USA clinical development program with the benefit of enhanced clarity as to the FDA’s expectations and requirements for a registrational program, including the design of the trials needed for approval, manufacturing assays, and comparability studies, as set forth below.
 REGEN-006/proact 1 trial:
 REGEN-006 (proact 1) is a Phase 3, randomized, single-blinded, bi-lateral kidney dose, sham control arm, controlled efficacy study of REACT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD Stages 3a-4 with moderate to severe albuminuria. Albuminuria refers to the presence of an excess of the protein albumin in urine, which is a sign of kidney disease. This study will be conducted in clinical centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, Israel, Mexico, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of up to two REACT injections given three months apart and delivered into biopsied and non-biopsied contralateral kidneys using a minimally invasive percutaneous approach. The total planned enrollment is 600 subjects. Subjects in the treatment group will receive two doses of REACT of 3x106 cells/g-KWest. The study will enroll subjects between the ages of 30 and 80 years of age with an eGFR>20 and <50 mL/min/1.73m2.
 The primary composite endpoint is the time from first injection to the earliest of:
 

 | at least 40% reduction in eGFR, using the 2009 CKD-EPI serum creatinine equation, sustained for 30 days;


 | eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m² using the 2009 CKD-EPI serum creatinine equation, sustained for 30 days and/or chronic dialysis, and/or renal transplant; or


 | renal or cardiovascular death.

 
Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the treatment group and the “masked” sham control group prior to kidney biopsy.


Each of the subjects in the treatment group will receive the first REACT injection 12 weeks following kidney biopsy. After three months, a second injection will be given, as appropriate, into the contralateral kidney. In contrast, subjects in the control group will receive two sham injections, the first of which will be administered 12 weeks following sham biopsy, and the second of which will be administered three months after the first sham injection. During this time, subjects in the control (sham) group will receive contemporaneous, standard-of-care therapy for CKD while undergoing follow-up evaluations at one, 14 and 28 days (+7 days) following the first injection, and then at three months (+10 days) following the first injection, similar to subjects in the treatment group. All subjects will continue in the study until the global trial end date is announced and an end of study visit is completed.
 Subjects will complete the KDQOL and EQ-5D-5L surveys. Scores from the treatment group will be compared against scores from the control group. In addition, each subject’s baseline score will be compared against his or her KDQOL scores obtained over the 24-month period after the last REACT injection. Additionally, KDQOL scores from subjects who received a single REACT injection may be compared against scores from subjects who received two injections.
 This study began enrollment in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 88 subjects had signed informed consent forms, with 38 subjects randomized in the US and Canada. Enrollment in Australia, Mexico, the UK and Taiwan is expected to begin in 2023.
 Initial interim data is expected at the end of 2024. Results from interim data may not be indicative of results from future data.
 REGEN-016/proact 2:
 REGEN-016 (proact 2) is a planned Phase 3, randomized, single-blinded, sham control arm, bi-lateral kidney dose, controlled efficacy study of REACT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD Stages 3a-4 with moderate to severe albuminuria. This study will be implemented in clinical centers in Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific and some United States centers.
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of up to two REACT injections given three months apart and delivered into biopsied and non-biopsied contralateral kidneys using a minimally invasive percutaneous approach. The total planned enrollment is 600 subjects. Subjects in the treatment group will receive two doses of REACT of 3x106 cells/g-KWest. The study will enroll subjects between the ages of 30 and 80 years of age with an eGFR>20 and<50 mL/min/1.73m2.
 Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the treatment group and the “masked” sham control group prior to kidney biopsy.
 Each of the subjects in the treatment group will receive the first REACT injection 12 weeks following kidney biopsy. After three months, a second injection will be given, as appropriate, into the contralateral kidney. In contrast, subjects in the control group will receive two sham injections, the first of which will be administered 12 weeks following sham biopsy, and the second of which will be administered three months after the first sham injection. During this time, subjects in the control group will receive contemporaneous, standard-of-care therapy for CKD while undergoing follow-up evaluations at the same time intervals as subjects in the treatment group. All subjects will continue in the study until the global trial end date is announced and an end of study visit is completed.
 The primary composite endpoint is the time from first injection to the earliest of:
 

 | at least 40% reduction in eGFR, using the 2009 CKD-EPI serum creatinine equation, sustained for 30 days;


 | eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m² using the 2009 CKD-EPI serum creatinine equation, sustained for 30 days and/or chronic dialysis, and/or renal transplant; or


 | renal or cardiovascular death.

 
Subjects will complete the KDQOL and EQ-5D-5L surveys. Scores from the treatment group will be compared against scores from the control group. In addition, each subject’s baseline score will be compared against his or her KDQOL scores obtained over the period after the last REACT injection. Additionally, KDQOL scores from subjects who received a single REACT injection may be compared against scores from subjects who received two injections.
 Enrollment in this study is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2023.
 We plan to evaluate interim data for REGEN-016 in mid-2025, with the potential for conditional FDA approval anticipated in 2026.
 Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)
 CAKUT is a group of abnormalities affecting the kidneys or other structures of the urinary tract. CAKUT results from abnormal development of the urinary tract system and is present at birth (i.e., it is congenital), although the abnormality may not become apparent until later in life. CAKUT is the most common kind of congenital birth defect, affecting roughly 1 in 500 babies born.


Individuals with CAKUT have one or more kidney or urinary tract abnormalities. The parts of the urinary tract that may be affected include the bladder, the tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters), and the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body (the urethra). For paired structures, like the kidneys and ureters, one or both may be affected.
 There are various types of CAKUT. Many different developmental abnormalities are classified as CAKUT, including underdevelopment or absence of a kidney and nephrons, a kidney formed of fluid-filled sacs called cysts, buildup of urine in the kidneys, an extra ureter leading to the kidney, a blockage in a ureter where it joins the kidney, an abnormally wide ureter, backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter, and an abnormal membrane in the prostatic urethra that blocks the flow of urine out of the bladder.
 The causes of CAKUT are complex, and much remains to be uncovered about the genetic and environmental regulators of kidney and outflow tract development. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to the formation of kidney and urinary tract abnormalities. The genetic factors involved in most cases of CAKUT are unknown. Syndromic CAKUT is caused by changes in the genes associated with the particular syndrome. Variations in these same genes can also underlie some cases of isolated CAKUT. In addition, environmental factors may influence development of CAKUT. The risk of CAKUT is higher in babies whose mothers had diabetes, took certain medications that are harmful to the kidneys, such as some anti-seizure medicines, or lacked certain vitamins and minerals, such as folate and iron, during pregnancy.
 Most cases of CAKUT are diagnosed from antenatal ultrasound imaging, and the remaining cases of CAKUT are usually only diagnosed after an infant or child develops a urinary tract infection, prompting ultrasound and/or other imaging studies to examine the kidneys and outflow tracts.
 CAKUT is often one of several features of a condition that affects multiple body systems, and it varies in severity. The abnormalities can result in recurrent urinary tract infections or a buildup of urine in the urinary tract, which may damage the kidneys or other structures. Severe CAKUT can lead to life-threatening kidney failure and ESRD. Children with severe CAKUT may require dialysis and transplantation as infants, and they may experience long-term effects on their ability to lead independent lives as adults.
 There is currently a need for greater understanding of the pathogenesis of CAKUT, as well as an unmet need for means for providing proper treatment of those affected by this condition.
 Phase 1 (REGEN-004):
 REGEN-004 is a Phase 1, prospective, open-label, single-arm, safety, tolerability, and early efficacy study of REACT in subjects with CKD from CAKUT.
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of up to two REACT injections given six months (up to four weeks after target date) apart and delivered into the biopsied kidney using a minimally invasive percutaneous approach that can be delivered under conscious sedation in less than 90 minutes in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease with eGFRs between 14 and 50 ml/min/1.73m2 due to CAKUT. Five subjects were enrolled in this trial. Subjects received two doses of REACT of 3x106 cells/g-KWest.
 As of December 31, 2022, all five subjects had received their first injection, and four subjects had received both injections. The trial concluded in January 2023 with the last patient, last visit.
 Early interim results as of August 2021 demonstrated that in three of the five subjects currently enrolled, kidney function had improved to an annualized eGFR slope of 3.38 ml/min/1.73m2/year compared to their pre-dose slope of negative-4.19ml/min/1.73m2/year. As of January 2023, there have been no adverse events reported to be associated with REACT and no reported procedure-related renal related serious adverse events in this trail.
The final clinical study report is anticipated in the third quarter of 2023.
 Planned Studies
 Phase 2 (REGEN-015 Multi-dose study)
 REGEN-015 is a planned Phase 2 open-label study of REACT in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and CKD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of supplemental REACT injections in participants who have previously received REACT treatment. In this study, up to 10 participants will enroll in the trial after parent REACT protocol end of study visit is completed. Participants may undergo a biopsy to manufacture REACT if additional biopsy tissue is required. Participants will receive two supplemental REACT injections. All participants will be followed for 12 months post their last supplemental REACT injection.
Phase 4 Clinical Development (REGEN-008)
 REGEN-008 is a Phase 4, prospective, open-label, observational master protocol study of REACT in subjects with diabetes and CKD who were previously enrolled and treated with REACT. Additional sub-study protocols will be created to capture subjects from parent protocols.
 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of up to two REACT injections given three-six months apart on kidney function in participants with diabetes and CKD.
 Subjects with exposure to REACT will continue for long-term follow-up observation visits which will occur every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for years 3, 4, and 5, alternating in-person and telephone visits, for a total of 15 planned visits for the duration of the study.
 We plan to continue REGEN-008 long-term follow-up to 2030.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition, and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including developers of tubular and glomerular cell drug modulators, e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, antifibrosis medications, e.g., Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (“MRAs”), induced pluripotent cells, other autologous mesenchymal stem cells and mechanical renal assist devices such as implantable and wearable renal dialysis machines, and advances in peritoneal dialysis and home dialysis. Cell-based clinical trials by other companies are underway globally with umbilical, adipose and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells for CKD. Early-phase human induced pluripotent stem cell therapies for kidney diseases are ongoing in Japan.
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, dosing, cost, effectiveness of promotional support and intellectual property protection. With respect specifically to REACT, we expect the key competitive factors affecting its success, if approved, will include the intended patient population, the relative convenience of dosing and administration, and efficacy.
 Many other companies working on medications for controlling chronic kidney disease, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. We believe that our principal competitors include developers of SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin (marketed as Invokana® by companies including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), dapagliflozin (marketed under the brand names Farxiga® and Forxiga® by companies including AstraZeneca plc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), empagliflozin (marketed as Jardiance® by companies including Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company) and finerenone (marketed as Kerendia® by companies including Bayer AG), and MRAs, which are small-molecule therapies recently approved to lower risks of CKD progression. Future collaborations, mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors.
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. These competitors may also vie for a similar pool of qualified scientific and management talent, sites and patient populations for clinical trials, as well as for technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Supply and Manufacturing
 We believe that over the last 20 years we have optimized our manufacturing technology for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”). In doing so, we have established a considerable intellectual property estate, combined with extensive manufacturing know-how, to enable us to manufacture REACT with consistent quality.
 With support from high level manufacturing and regulatory expertise, our internal manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to progress rapidly through our clinical trials. We believe that our current manufacturing capacities enable us to provide sufficient quantities of clinical trial material to supply our clinical trials. As we continue to develop our product candidates, we may need to expand our manufacturing capacities. The manufacturing facilities located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and the quality systems are intended to be compliant with global quality standards. It usually takes approximately 12 weeks to produce the clinical REACT products. As of the date hereof, our manufacturing team, facilities, and bioprocess capacity have produced over 200 cell therapies.

Our facility design and quality systems have been audited by European Qualified Persons (QP) and certified as compliant with EU cGMP requirements for phase 2/3 manufacturing. Our bioprocesses have been reviewed by the FDA and EMA and validation activities are ongoing in anticipation of being commercial-ready for the potential launch of REACT. We plan to build additional manufacturing capacity to meet the expanding demand.
 Our commercial strategy focuses on process automation to scale up to meet the projected market for REACT, if we obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. We are collaborating with engineering companies such as DEKA Research & Development Corp. to develop automated manufacturing processes for the potential commercial production of REACT, including a REACT launch facility after we complete the Phase 3 patient enrollment and dosing in 2026, and two commercial manufacturing facilities after we launch REACT.
 We expect to utilize automation in all aspects of manufacturing ranging from tissue processing, cell expansion and renal cell selection to formulation and filling of the final product. We will also extend automation to other manufacturing activities, including warehouse operations and supply chain. In addition, we intend to improve bioprocess development to further reduce manufacturing costs of the commercial REACT product, assuming receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Culture media represents the highest cost in REACT processing, and we are exploring reduced culture media usage via bioprocess and automation improvements. Further, our final commercial REACT product is planned to be a cryopreserved formulation, which we expect to reduce manufacturing costs compared to our fresh REACT formulation. We expect to leverage bulk purchasing to actively negotiate pricing of materials to further drive cost reductions. However, there can be no assurance that the manufacturing costs for our Phase 3 trials when we manufacture REACT at commercial scale will actually be lower than for our ongoing Phase 2 RMCL-002 study. A number of factors may contribute to an inability to achieve these cost reductions, including any failures to achieve the automation efficiencies that we anticipate, cost overruns or inefficiencies in the supply chain and any failure to improve the formulation or bioprocessing of REACT in a manner that results in lower costs.

 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we have or are pursuing patents covering the composition of matter for each of our product candidates and we generally pursue patent protection covering methods-of-use for each clinical trial. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide a period of clinical data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our products.
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to adapt to competition or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop.


To cover our proprietary technologies, proprietary cell-based REACT product and related methods, such as methods of use, we have filed patent applications representing 15 patent families. As of December 31, 2022, our patent estate, which is solely owned, included 286 total issued patents or pending patent applications with nine issued U.S. patents, nine pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, 160 issued foreign patents and 104 pending foreign patent applications in various foreign jurisdictions.
 Specifically, our patent family with claims directed to cells formulated in REACT, implantable constructs, and methods of using the same to, for example, improve kidney function or treat kidney disease, includes 31 issued patents and nine pending patent applications. Patents in this family have been issued in nine jurisdictions, including the United States (three issued patents), Europe (two issued patents, each separately validated in seven countries), China, Japan, and South Korea. Issued patents and any further patents that may be issued from this family’s nine pending applications are expected to expire in 2029 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 We also own two patent families directed to our REACT formulations and methods of preparing the formulations. Across these families, we have 16 issued patents in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, and Canada. We also have 13 patent applications that are pending in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe, China, Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Patents across these two patent families, including any patents that may be issued from the pending applications, are expected to expire between 2031 and 2038, depending upon their respective filing dates and absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 Additionally, we own two patent families with claims directed to quality control methods for ensuring that renal cells for formulation in REACT, prepared by our proprietary methods, have phenotypic and functional profiles indicative of therapeutic activity. Within the first patent family, we have 58 issued patents in various jurisdictions, including the United States (two issued patents), Europe (two issued patents, one of which has been validated in 21 countries and the other has been validated in 20 countries), China, Japan (two issued patents), South Korea (two issued patents), Hong Kong, Australia (two issued patents), and New Zealand (two issued patents) and are expected to expire in 2033 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also have nine patent applications that are pending in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Australia, China, and South Korea, and are expected to expire in 2033 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Our second patent family includes a PCT stage application. Any patents that issue from a national or regional stage application filed from this PCT application are expected to expire in 2041 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 We further own three patent families directed to methods of improving kidney function and/or in treating kidney disease, e.g., diabetic kidney disease or kidney disease resulting from a congenital anomaly. Across these families, we have three issued patents, including one U.S. patent and 30 pending patent applications filed in 15 jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, China, Korea, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Canada, and Mexico. Our issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2037 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Patents across all three patent families, if issued, are expected to expire between 2036 and 2042, depending upon their respective filing dates and absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 In addition, we plan to file additional applications on aspects of our innovations that may have patent terms that extend beyond these dates.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application, which serves as a priority application. However, the term of a U.S. patent may be extended to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a medicine (a patent term extension) or by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) (referred to as patent term adjustment). For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved medicines of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the medicine is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent covering an approved medicine or its method of use may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to obtain and maintain a proprietary position on our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims on these pending patents and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future

file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize products with similar mechanisms of action and duplicate our methods of treatments or strategies without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a therapeutic product we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our clinical candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in pharmaceuticals is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our clinical candidates.
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in enforcing the claims that have been granted or may grant. However, any of our patents, including patents that we may rely on to protect our market for approved therapeutics, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction. Alternatively, we may decide that it is in our interest to settle a litigation in a manner that affects the term or enforceability of our patent. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that have been or may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents.
 Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Government regulation
 In the United States, biological products, including cell-based regenerative therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), the Public Health Service Act (the “PHS Act”) and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Each clinical trial protocol for a cell-based therapy product must be reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of any biological product. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene or cell-based therapies, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state legislatures, agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard, could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 U.S. biological products development process
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

 | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


 | submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug (“IND”) application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


 | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an investigational review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) and other clinical-trial related regulation, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational biological product for each proposed indication;


 | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for each proposed indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, compliance with the FDA’s current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTPs”) for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP and GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the BLA;


 | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;


 | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

Preclinical Testing
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a cell-based regenerative therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of a product candidate’s biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, signed into law on December 29, 2022, (P.L. 117-328) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act to specify that nonclinical testing for drugs and biologics may, but is not required to, include in vivo animal testing. According to the amended language, a sponsor may fulfill nonclinical testing requirements by completing various in vitro assays (e.g., cell-based assays, organ chips, or microphysiological systems), in silico studies (i.e., computer modeling), other human or nonhuman biology-based tests (e.g., bioprinting), or in vivo animal tests.
 The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after an IND for an investigational drug candidate is submitted to the FDA and human clinical trials have been initiated.
 Human clinical trials in support of a BLA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with GCP requirements and protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 An IND provides an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and is also a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any biologic product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, an applicant must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA issues a notice expressly authorizing the proposed trial to proceed or raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. If FDA raises concerns or places the trial on clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the agency must resolve any outstanding concerns before the proposed trials can begin.


As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval or licensing. In particular, such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee (an “IEC”) and informed consent from subjects and must meet other clinical trial requirements, such as sufficient patient population size and statistical powering. The FDA must be able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary by the FDA.
 An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”). This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study.
 Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The National Institutes of Health’s (“NIH’s”) Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and both NIH and FDA have brought enforcement actions against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

 | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


 | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for approval and product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
 In the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress amended the FDCA to require sponsors of a Phase 3 clinical trial, or other “pivotal study” of a new drug to support marketing authorization, to submit a diversity action plan for such clinical trial. The action plan must include the sponsor’s diversity goals for enrollment, as well as a rationale for the goals and a description of how the sponsor will meet them. A sponsor must submit a diversity action plan to FDA by the time the sponsor submits the trial protocol to the agency for review. The FDA may grant a waiver for some or all of the requirements for a diversity action plan. It is

unknown at this time how the diversity action plan may affect Phase 3 trial planning and timing or what specific information FDA will expect in such plans, but if FDA objects to a sponsor’s diversity action plan and requires the sponsor to amend the plan or take other actions, it may delay trial initiation.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the responsible IRBs and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of such information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
 Human cell-based products administered directly into kidney tissue are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, purity and potency of human cell-based therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. review and approval processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity, potency and efficacy of the investigational product for its proposed indication or indications to the satisfaction of the FDA. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (the “PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for registered biologic product manufacturers. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure, potent and effective for its proposed indication or indications and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure the continued safety, purity and potency of such product.
 Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.


Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a cell-based therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the cGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/ Ps”), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through appropriate screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 Additionally, the FDA may refer any BLA, including applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the medicine outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the medicine or biological product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The PREA requires a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”), within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
 The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If a product receives regulatory approval from the FDA, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials,

including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track, RMAT and Priority Review Designations
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, RMAT designation and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development or FDA review of medicines and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process.
 To be eligible for fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a new medicine or biological product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA or BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), enacted in December 2016, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, or RMATs, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineered products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. REACT has received RMAT designation from the FDA. RMAT designation does not include HCT/Ps regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A sponsor may request that FDA designate a medicine as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the medicine meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the medicine has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life- threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
 Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a medicine or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed medicine represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 months to six months for an original BLA or for a New Molecular Entity NDA from the date of filing.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, RMAT therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 Accelerated approval pathway
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on

the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a medicine or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a medicine receiving accelerated approval perform post- marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a medicine, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a medicine.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a medicine, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of medicines for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the medicine’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the medicine. As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress provided FDA additional statutory authority to mitigate potential risks to patients from continued marketing of ineffective drugs previously granted accelerated approval. Under the act’s amendments to the FDCA, FDA may require the sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to have a confirmatory trial underway prior to approval. The sponsor must also submit progress reports on a confirmatory trial every six months until the trial is complete, and such reports are published on FDA’s website. The amendments also give FDA the option of using expedited procedures to withdraw product approval if the sponsor’s confirmatory trial fails to verify the claimed clinical benefits of the product.
 All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post-approval requirements
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements.
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. We must comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP and cGTP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics and HCT/Ps are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, as well as applicable foreign counterparts, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by such governmental authorities for compliance with cGMP, cGTP and other laws. Accordingly, we must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Future inspections by governmental authorities may identify compliance issues at our facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMP or cGTP, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may

result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below.
 Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet, as well as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 Once an approval or clearance of a medicine is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


 | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and


 | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.

 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of pharmaceutical distributors by the states. Furthermore, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”) was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription medicines distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development

and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 A biological product may also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a Written Request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies.
 Reference product exclusivity for biological products
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the “BPCIA”). The BPCIA amended the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”) to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars.
 A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA approved the first interchangeable biosimilars, including an interchangeable monoclonal antibody biosimilar, in 2021.
 The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed. As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress amended the PHSA in order to permit multiple interchangeable products approved on the same day to receive and benefit from this one-year exclusivity period. If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a

subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 The BPCIA is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Additional regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 Furthermore, some countries have enacted or are considering enacting legal restrictions on the import or export of human genetic materials, cells or tissues. For example, in China, the Ministry of Science and Technology (“MOST”) and the former Ministry of Health in June 1998 jointly established the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources in China. In July 2015, the MOST issued the Service Guide for the Examination and Approval of Sampling, Collecting, Trading, Exporting Human Genetic Resources, which provides that foreign entities that collect and use patients’ human genetic resources in clinical trials shall be required to file for an advance approval with the Human Genetic Resources Administration Office (“HGRAO”) through its online system.
 In October 2017, the MOST issued the Circular on Optimizing the Administrative Examination and Approval of Human Genetic Resources, which simplified the approval process for collecting and using human genetic resources for the purpose of seeking marketing authorization of medicines in China.
 In May 2019, the State Council of China issued the Regulation on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources (the “HGR Regulation”), which stipulates the approval requirements pertinent to research collaborations between Chinese and foreign-owned entities. Pursuant to this new rule, a new filing system (as opposed to the advance approval approach originally in place) is put in place for international clinical trials using Chinese patients’ biospecimens at clinical study sites without involving the export of such biospecimens outside of China. A notification filing that specifies the type, quantity and usage of the biospecimens, among others, with the HGRAO is required before conducting such clinical trials. The collection, use, and outbound transfer of Chinese patients’ biospecimens in international collaboration for basic scientific research involving export are still subject to the advance approval of the HGRAO.
 In October 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the China Biosecurity Law, which became effective on April 15, 2021. The China Biosecurity Law reaffirms the regulatory requirements stipulated by the HGR Regulation while potentially increasing the administrative fines significantly in cases in which foreign entities are alleged to have collected, preserved or exported Chinese human genetic resources.
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
 Government regulation outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable

foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 European Union clinical trials regulation
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and at least one IEC, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. Under the current regime (the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and corresponding national laws) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated medicine that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 Under the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which came into effect on January 31, 2022, there is a centralized application procedure where one EU Member State’s competent authority takes the lead in reviewing part I of the application, which contains scientific and medicinal product documentation, and the other national authorities only have limited involvement. Part II, which contains the national and patient-level documentation, is assessed individually by each EU Member State. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Currently, the extent to which clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the clinical trial is initiated or on the duration of an ongoing trial. As of January 2023, all new clinical trials must comply with the Clinical Trials Regulation. In addition, any clinical trial that was already under way as of January 1, 2023 and continues for more than 3 years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable (i.e., January 31, 2025), the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 Medicinal product review and approval in the EEA
 In the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) (comprised of the EU Member States plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”), are subject to extensive pre-and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EEA and national levels. Regulated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 (the “ATMP Regulation”), ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. The CAT (as defined below) designated REACT as a tissue engineered product. Gene therapy products deliver genes into the body that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect. We anticipate that REACT will be regulated as an ATMP in the EEA.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an ATMP under EEA regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) under the centralized procedure administered by the EMA. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to the required application process in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, certain specific requirements set out in the ATMP Regulation, for example certain additional product characteristic information that must be included in the MAA. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across all of the EEA. As provided for in the ATMP Regulation, the scientific evaluation of MAAs for ATMPs is primarily performed by a specialized scientific committee called the Committee for Advanced Therapies (the “CAT”). The CAT prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of the ATMP which is the subject of the MAA, which is sent for final approval to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”). The CHMP recommendation is then sent to the European Commission, which adopts a decision binding in all EEA Member States. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA for an ATMP is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CAT and/or CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, which makes and issues the final decision to grant a marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the timeframe of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 Because the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing

authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January, 1 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 Data and marketing exclusivity
 The EEA also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving marketing authorization in the EEA, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on a MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. There is, however, no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may therefore not qualify for data exclusivity.
 Post-approval controls
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include the following:
 

 | The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that


system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).


 | All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.


 | All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”), and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.

 
Failure to comply with European Union and EU Member State laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products (both before and after grant of the marketing authorization), manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Such penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant the marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 As of January 1, 2021, EU law no longer directly applies in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has adopted existing EU medicines regulation as standalone UK legislation with some amendments to reflect procedural and other requirements with respect to marketing authorizations and other regulatory provisions.
 In order to market medicines in the United Kingdom, manufacturers must hold a UK authorization. On January 1, 2021, all EU marketing authorizations were converted to UK marketing authorizations subject to a manufacturer opt-out. UK medicines legislation

is subject to future regulatory change under the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which sets out a framework for the adoption of medicines regulation. Guidance issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, states that the United Kingdom will have the power to take into account marketing authorizations made under the EU decentralized and mutual recognition procedures. In addition, the MHRA’s guidance has been updated to refer to new national licensing procedures including new routes of evaluation for novel and biotechnological products.
 Different rules will apply in Northern Ireland following implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. In Northern Ireland, EU central marketing applications will continue to apply.
 The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom contains an Annex in relation to medicinal products with the objective of facilitating availability of medicines, promotion of public health and consumer protection in respect of medicinal products. The Annex provides for mutual recognition of good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspections and certificates, meaning that manufacturing facilities do not need to undergo duplicate inspections for the two markets. The Annex establishes a Working Group on Medicinal Products to deal with matters under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, facilitate co-operation and for the carrying out of technical discussions. It is expected that further bilateral discussions will continue with respect to regulatory areas not the subject of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, including pharmacovigilance. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement also does not include reciprocal arrangements for the recognition of batch testing certification. However, the United Kingdom has listed approved countries, including the EEA which will enable UK importers and wholesales to recognize certain certification and regulatory standards. The European Commission has not adopted such recognition procedures.
 Relatedly, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) has been implemented in the United Kingdom (as the UK GDPR). The UK GDPR sits alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the EU GDPR into United Kingdom law. Under the UK GDPR, companies not established in the United Kingdom but who process personal data in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the United Kingdom, or to monitor their behavior will be subject to the UK GDPR – the requirements of which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs with potential fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission issued a decision that the United Kingdom ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred under the EU GDPR from the European Union to the United Kingdom. In 2022, the UK government proposed and debated the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill to harmonize the 2018 Data Protection Act, UK GDPR, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations under one legislative framework. However, progress on the bill stalled as the government continues to assess the most optimal approach to data protection reform.
Other health care laws and compliance requirements
 If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include:
 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “AKS”), which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the AKS or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) or federal civil money penalties statute;


 | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;


 | the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (beneficiary inducement law), which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;


 | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services relating to health care matters; similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;


 | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of medicines, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under the Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse midwives and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family; and


 | the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships and interactions with foreign government officials, which prohibit U.S. companies and their employees, officers, and representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official (including, potentially, healthcare professionals in countries in which we operate or may sell our products), government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise seek favorable treatment.

 

Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the health care laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the AKS and FCA, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Health Care Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the FCA as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
 Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing health care fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other health care providers are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also subject us to foreign equivalents of the health care laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
 If any of the physicians or other health care providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded health care programs, which may also adversely affect our business.


The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain a robust system to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a health care company may violate one or more of the requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations will involve substantial cost.
 Data Privacy and Security
 There are federal, state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information and personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and apply simultaneously, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, strengthens and expands requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information.
 HITECH strengthened and expanded HIPAA and increased penalties for violations. Under HITECH, regulated entities are subject to enforcement by the federal government and by state Attorneys General, who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. Some state laws impose privacy protections more stringent than HIPAA and data security requirements applicable to information beyond health care information (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”)). These state laws create an additional level of enforcement and may require additional reporting in the event of breach. Most of the health care providers in the United States with whom we collaborate to develop and test our products must comply with HIPAA and applicable state law. We may not be directly subject to these laws, however, we must structure our activities in compliance with these laws to ensure that we can access and use health information to support our research, development and other activities. Our failure to comply with these privacy and security laws or a breach of health information or personal data could prompt enforcement against our health care provider partners, create third party liability for our company and/or cause significant financial or reputational harm to our company.
 We may also be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining explicit consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union and EEA, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.
 Health care reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product and therapeutic candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product and therapeutic candidates that obtain marketing approval. The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product and therapeutic candidates.  If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic and biosimilar products for branded

prescription medicines and biologics, respectively. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for medicines and biologics administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs and biologics. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products we may market in the future. While Medicare regulations apply only to pharmaceutical benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 The ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, was enacted in 2010 and substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for therapeutics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription medicines, created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, and expanded the 340B drug discount program. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of medicines and biological products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price, to the DHHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA since its enactment, and it is possible that there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the ACA that affect health care expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023,and will remain in effect through 2032 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, but it is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry in the United States.
 In recent years, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which biopharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to medicine pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of medicines under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control the costs of medicines, making this area subject to ongoing uncertainty.
 More recently, in August 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). Among other things, the IRA has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of a drug or biological product covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if the drug product’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting in payment year 2026, CMS will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single-source Part D drugs, including biologics that have been on the market for 13 years, without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs, including biologics that have been on the market for 13 years, starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease.
 At the state level in the United States, legislatures have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers and other members of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.


We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional federal, state, and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any cell-based regenerative therapies for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any cell-based therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from payors. Payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers who prescribe such treatments generally rely on these third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the treatment and other associated health care costs. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a medicine, device or biologic product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a payor not to cover our cell-based therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products, if they are approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development and manufacturing costs. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or may lose employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products in certain jurisdictions.
 In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
 Additionally, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit.
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed with the government authority. Furthermore, some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to current standards of care as part of so-called health technology assessments in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Additionally, there may be a need for activities to secure reimbursement for procedures associated with products administered in a hospital setting under the diagnosis-related group system, whereby a billing code may not exist or may be currently insufficient to cover the cost of the procedure. In other instances, countries may monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions in the form of treatment policies. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures.
